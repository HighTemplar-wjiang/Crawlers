5,A Method to Evaluate Spectral Analysis by Spectroscopy,"Visible and near infrared spectroscopy has been widely used to develop a method for rapidly determining organic carbon in soils or sediments (SOC). Most of these studies concentrated on how to establish a good spectral model but ignored how to evaluate the method, such as the use of detection range (max and min), resolution and error for SOC spectral analysis. Here, we proposed a method to evaluate the spectral analysis of SOC. Using 96 sediments sampled in the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea, China, we established three spectral models of SOC after collecting their spectral reflectance by Agilent Cary 5000, ASD FieldSpec 4 and Ocean Optics QEPro, respectively. For both the calibration set and validation set in each spectrometer, the predicted SOC concentrations followed a distribution curve (function), in which the x-axis was the SOC concentrations. Using these curves, we developed these four technical parameters. The detection ranges were the SOC concentrations where the curve was near to or crossing with the lateral axis, while the detection resolution was the average difference between the two neighboring SOC concentrations. The detection errors were the differences between the predicted SOC and the measured SOC. Results showed that these technical parameters were better in the bench-top spectrometer (Cary 5000) than those in the portable spectrometers when analyzing the same samples. For the portable spectrometers, QEPro had a broader detection range and more consistent detection error than FieldSpec 4, suggesting that the low-cost QEPro performed as well as the high-cost FieldSpec 4. This study provides a good example for evaluating spectral analysis by spectroscopy, which can support the development of the spectral method. \textcopyright{} 2022 by the authors.",,,,,,TRUE,10.3390/s22155638,,,https://doi.org/10.3390/s22155638,10.3390__s22155638,,FALSE
6,A Miniaturized Flexible Functional Near-infrared Spectroscopy System for Obstructive Sleep Apnea Detection,"The clinical manifestations of OSA (obstructive sleep apnea) are night sleep snoring accompanied by apnea. fNIRS (functional near-infrared spectroscopy) can measure the relative concentration changes of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin, thereby measuring hemodynamics and oxygenation. Combined with the clinical manifestations of obstructive sleep apnea, fNIRS technology can be used in the monitoring of OSA. According to the principle of fNIRS, a miniaturized, wireless, and flexible device is designed in the article. The device can measure the change of blood oxygen concentration in the forehead of the brain, so that achieve the purpose of detecting OSA. To verify the effectiveness of the equipment, a breathing experiment was designed in the article to compare the equipment with the existing NIRX system. To our best knowledge, this is the first work that proposed a miniaturized flexible sleep apnea system based on monitoring fluctuations of cerebral hemodynamics.

11,A Non-Invasive Cholesterol Measuring Device Using a Photodiode Sensor With a BLYNK Interface,"Degenerative disease affects the central nervous system, bones and joints, blood vessels, and heart and is caused by the degeneration of a tissue or organ system over time. Cholesterol is a naturally occurring chemical that has the physical properties of fat but a steroidal composition. Cholesterol is routinely created in the proper amounts by the body. Normal cholesterol levels in the body can be restored by utilizing the Easy Touch GCU device, which can be bought conveniently and inexpensively. Its use, however, necessitates the assistance of medical specialists. Non-invasive procedures, for example, have been widely developed in the development of measuring equipment or detection of cholesterol levels.

13,Accuracy and Reproducibility of Laboratory Diffuse Reflectance Measurements with Portable VNIR and MIR Spectrometers for Predictive Soil Organic Carbon Modeling,"Soil spectroscopy in the visible-to-near infrared (VNIR) and mid-infrared (MIR) is a costeffective method to determine the soil organic carbon content (SOC) based on predictive spectral models calibrated to analytical-determined SOC reference data. The degree to which uncertainty in reference data and spectral measurements contributes to the estimated accuracy of VNIR and MIR predictions, however, is rarely addressed and remains unclear, in particular for current handheld MIR spectrometers. We thus evaluated the reproducibility of both the spectral reflectance measurements with portable VNIR and MIR spectrometers and the analytical dry combustion SOC reference method, with the aim to assess how varying spectral inputs and reference values impact the calibration and validation of predictive VNIR and MIR models. Soil reflectance spectra and SOC were measured in triplicate, the latter by different laboratories, for a set of 75 finely ground soil samples covering a wide range of parent materials and SOC contents. Predictive partial least-squares regression (PLSR) models were evaluated in a repeated, nested cross-validation approach with systematically varied spectral inputs and reference data, respectively. We found that SOC predictions from both VNIR and MIR spectra were equally highly reproducible on average and similar to the dry combustion method, but MIR spectra were more robust to calibration sample variation. The contributions of spectral variation (\ensuremath{\Delta}RMSE < 0.4 g\cdot{}kg-1) and reference SOC uncertainty (\ensuremath{\Delta}RMSE < 0.3 g\cdot{}kg-1) to spectral modeling errors were small compared to the difference between the VNIR and MIR spectral ranges (\ensuremath{\Delta}RMSE ~1.4 g\cdot{}kg-1 in favor of MIR). For reference SOC, uncertainty was limited to the case of biased reference data appearing in either the calibration or validation. Given better predictive accuracy, comparable spectral reproducibility and greater robustness against calibration sample selection, the portable MIR spectrometer was considered overall superior to the VNIR instrument for SOC analysis. Our results further indicate that random errors in SOC reference values are effectively compensated for during model calibration, while biased SOC calibration data propagates errors into model predictions. Reference data uncertainty is thus more likely to negatively impact the estimated validation accuracy in soil spectroscopy studies where archived data, e.g., from soil spectral libraries, are used for model building, but it should be negligible otherwise. \textcopyright{} 2022 by the authors.

14,Achieving robustness across different ages and cultivars for an NIRS-PLSR model of fresh cassava root starch and dry matter content,"This study used a portable near-infrared (NIR) spectrometer at wavelengths of 570–1031 nm to evaluate starch content (SC) and dry matter content (DMC) in fresh cassava tubers. An improved model was developed for the prediction of cassava tuber quality. The cassava samples were taken from four main varieties: CMR38-125-77, KU50, RY11, and RY9. The samples were obtained 4–12 months after planting (MAP). Partial least squares (PLR) regression was combined with different variable selection methods and spectral pre-treatment. Their accuracies were then compared. Variable selection methods included the successive projections algorithm (SPA) and the genetic algorithm (GA). The NIR spectra were obtained in the interactance mode under field conditions. The GA wavelengths combined with sequential pre-processing by orthogonalization (SPORT) pre-processing provided the optimum model for predicting both the SC and the DMC of cassava. The R2p, RMSEp, and RPD of SC were 0.91, 1.76\%, and 3.26, respectively, and those of DMC were 0.75, 2.00\%, and 2.00, respectively. The most effective model was tested against unknown samples of newly developed varieties obtained from different harvest seasons, yielding RMSEp and bias values of 2.37\% and -9.178 \texttimes{} 10-6\%, respectively, for SC. For DMC, the RMSEp and bias values were 2.67\% and 4.16 \texttimes{} 10-14\%, respectively. The results suggest that the calibration model could be used to monitor the internal quality of cassava tubers in the field. The variety, age, position, and section of the tubers had a slight influence on the prediction performance; however, the prediction accuracy was acceptable for in-field applications. The in-field portable NIR spectrometer could become a new tool for breeders, saving time and costs. Breeders could evaluate SC without destroying the cassava roots or stalks and could correct and inspect the behaviour of the SC and DMC accumulation. \textcopyright{} 2022 Elsevier B.V.",,,,,,TRUE,10.1016/j.compag.2022.106872,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2022.106872,10.1016__j.compag.2022.106872,,FALSE
15,Acquisition of High Spectral Resolution Diffuse Reflectance Image Cubes (350-2500 nm) from Archaeological Wall Paintings and Other Immovable Heritage Using a Field-Deployable Spatial Scanning Reflectance Spectrometry Hyperspectral System,"There is growing interest in bringing non-invasive laboratory-based analytical imaging tools to field sites to study wall paintings in order to collect molecular information on the macroscale. Analytical imaging tools, such as reflectance imaging spectrometry, have provided a wealth of information about artist materials and working methods, as well as painting conditions. Currently, scientific analyses of wall paintings have been limited to point-measurement techniques such as reflectance spectroscopy (near-ultraviolet, visible, near-infrared, and mid-infrared), X-ray fluorescence, and Raman spectroscopy. Macroscale data collection methods have been limited to multispectral imaging in reflectance and luminescence modes, which lacks sufficient spectral bands to allow for the mapping and identification of artist materials of interest. The development of laboratory-based reflectance and elemental imaging spectrometers and scanning systems has sparked interest in developing truly portable versions, which can be brought to field sites to study wall paintings where there is insufficient space or electrical power for laboratory instruments. This paper presents the design and testing of a simple hyperspectral system consisting of a 2D spatial spot scanning spectrometer, which provides high spectral resolution diffuse reflectance spectra from 350 to 2500 nm with high signal to noise and moderate spatial resolution (few mm). This spectral range at high spectral resolution was found to provide robust chemical specificity sufficient to identify and map many artists' materials, as well as the byproducts of weathering and conservation coatings across the surface of ancient and Byzantine Cypriot wall paintings. Here, we present a detailed description of the hyperspectral system, its performance, and examples of its use to study wall paintings from Roman tombs in Cyprus. The spectral/spatial image processing workflow to make maps of pigments and constituent painting materials is also discussed. This type of configurable hyperspectral system and the imaging processing workflow offer a new tool for the field study of wall paintings and other immovable heritage.",,,,,,TRUE,10.3390/s22051915,,,https://doi.org/10.3390/s22051915,10.3390__s22051915,,FALSE

Hence, being able to classify the levels of stress an individual experiences remains important to one's health. This study utilized electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) captured while subjects played a mobile game that test their word construction ability. Multiple trials were conducted at varying difficulties in order to utilize a machine learning model to classify these varying levels of stress. Heart rate as well as galvanic skin response (GSR) data was also collected to reinforce the EEG and fNIRS findings. The data sets were then processed and verified using MATLAB and its machine learning model. The findings show that although each higher level of difficulty did not always increase the amount of stress felt, the overall act of playing the game put individuals at a higher state of stress compared with when they were not playing the game. \textcopyright{} 2022 IEEE.",,,,,,TRUE,10.1109/UEMCON54665.2022.9965628,,,https://doi.org/10.1109/UEMCON54665.2022.9965628,10.1109__UEMCON54665.2022.9965628,,FALSE
17,An Energy-Efficient Wearable Functional Near-infrared Spectroscopy System Employing Dual-level Adaptive Sampling Technique,"Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a powerful medical imaging tool in brain science and psychology, it can also be employed in brain-computer interface (BCI) due to its noninvasive and artifact-less-sensitive characteristics. Conventional ways to detect large-area brain activity using near-infrared (NIR) technology are based on Time-division or Frequency-division modulation technique, which traverses all physical sensory channels in a specific period. To achieve higher imaging resolution or brain-tasks classification accuracy, the NIRS system require higher density and more channels, which conflict with the limited battery capacity. Inspired by the functional atlas of the human brain, this paper proposes a spatial adaptive sampling (SAS) method. It can change the active channel pattern of the fNIRS system to match with the real-time brain activity, to increase the energy efficiency without significant reduction on the brain imaging quality or the accuracy of brain activity classification. Therefore, the number of the averaging enabled channels will be dramatically reduced in practice. To verify the proposed SAS technique, a wearable and flexible NIRS system has been implemented, in which each channel of light-emitting diode (LED) drive circuits and photodiode (PD) detection circuits can be power gated independently. Brain task experiments have been conducted to validate the proposed method, the power consumption of the LED drive module is reduced by 46.58\% compared to that without SAS technology while maintaining an average brain imaging PSNR (Peak Signal to Noise Ratio) of 35 dB. The brain-task classification accuracy is 80.47\%, which has a 2.67\% reduction compared to that without the SAS technique.",,,,,,TRUE,10.1109/TBCAS.2022.3149766,,,https://doi.org/10.1109/TBCAS.2022.3149766,10.1109__TBCAS.2022.3149766,,FALSE

The proposed methodology is mostly carried out in situ by using easy-to-use and cheap portable instrumentation for the acquisition of multispectral images, punctual ultraviolet-visible-near infrared fiber-optics reflectance spectroscopy (FORS) and punctual fiber optics fluorescence spectroscopy. Further analytical information is provided by non-invasive in-situ sampling of paper surface by using soft latex sponges, making possible laboratory chromatographic and infrared spectroscopic analyses on the aqueous sponge extracts. The proposed diagnostics method was applied to two 17th century letters written by St Francis of Sales (1567–1622), collected at the Chigi Palace in the town of Ariccia (Italy). Results show an intense oxidative degradation of the letters, also localized in water spots, and the presence of carboxylic acids by-products. Analysis of FORS spectra provided the concentration of chromophores in the paper substrate. The diagnostic method allowed the identification of gelatin sizing, the presence of starch glue in specific areas of the letters and the type of ink used in the text.

21,Application and development of phototherapy for metabolic associated disease,"Phototherapy is beneficial in the treatment of many diseases, especially non-invasive phototherapy, because it directly irradiates the target tissue without irreversible damage. Phototherapy produces benign biological stimulation, responses, and photochemical effects that regulate a variety of bodily functions, such as blood function, nerve impulse transmission, enzyme activity, metabolism, and immunity. With the aging of the population and changes in lifestyle, the incidence of metabolism-related diseases is increasing. At present, the wavelengths used for the treatment of metabolism-related diseases in LLLT are divided into three wavelengths: red, near-infrared and ultraviolet. The most commonly used light source is a laser. However, with the development of third generation semiconductor materials and semiconductor lighting technology, a new light source, the light emitting diode (LED), has emerged. LEDs cover almost the full spectrum of wavelengths, which opens up the possibility of using phototherapy for different diseases. In summary, low light therapy is a promising method for the treatment of metabolism-related diseases.

22,Application of Nonlinear Correction Algorithm in Near Infrared Spectra Analysis during On-site Quick Detection,"Performance of portable near-infrared spectrometers is easily affected by various factors such as on-site environment, which results in a certain deviation in the on-site predicted results. Partially least square regression (PLSR), as a multiple linear regression method, has been widely used for the analysis of near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy. However, due to the nonlinear characteristics of the relationship between spectral data and dependent variables, PLSR can easily lead to model errors. Stability and predictability decreased when PLSR is applied in on-site quick detection. How to reduce the errors caused by various environmental factors in the use of portable near-infrared spectrometers is a key issue in promoting the wide application of rapid detection technology based on near-infrared spectral analysis. In this study, the absorption spectra data of glucose solutions of different concentrations are collected by a portable near-infrared spectrometer. Several nonlinear correction algorithms are applied to study the effect of environmental interference during the measurement process. Firstly, the collected spectra data is preprocessed. Secondly, the data is modeled by nonlinear correction algorithms such as optimized artificial neural network (ANN), support vector regression (SVR), and random forest (RF). The impact of different models is compared with to the results using PLSR. It is found that compared with the PLSR linear method, the ANN, SVR and RF nonlinear correction algorithm can eliminate the interference of environmental factors in different degrees. Therefore, ANN, SVR and RF algorithm can improve the prediction accuracy of the model. This study shows that the use of nonlinear correction algorithm for data modeling of portable near-infrared spectrometers can effectively improve the predictive performance of the model. \textcopyright{} 2022 SPIE.",,,,,,TRUE,10.1117/12.2638467,,,https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2638467,10.1117__12.2638467,,FALSE

26,Assessment of energy content of industrial woodchip based on prediction models of moisture content using portable NIR spectrophotometer,"According to the fundamental transition to renewable resources, the UE is investing many efforts in terms of economic policy and political approach to minimize environmental impact and ensure energy provision. In Italy the bioenergy sector represents an important contributor to the energy production from renewable resources with the promotion of low-carbon economy, so primary solid biofuels are considered the main competitor to the total share of electricity generation worldwide. Woodchip plays a fundamental role in the present political and economic background, considering as a good candidate for the transition from fossil to renewable fuels, because widely available and distributed as a natural resource. Woodchip presents a high inherent variability of properties, derived from different conditions and its variability influences its technical and energetic properties. For this reason, the requirement of quality characterization could be considered a necessary step to price setting and combustion management and efficiency. Near Infrared (NIR) spectroscopy is considered a reliable alternative method compared to the standard laboratory analysis because provide real time results in a rapid and cost-effective approach. Coupled with chemometrics to extract useful information from spectral data, it allows the development of prediction and/or classification models.

Their application for Brain–Computer Interfaces (BCI) allows for unobtrusively monitoring one's cognitive state over time. A particular state relevant in multiple domains is cognitive fatigue, which may impact performance and attention, among other capabilities. The monitoring of this state will be applied in real learning settings to detect and advise on effective break periods. In this study, two functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) wearable devices were employed to build a BCI to automatically detect the state of cognitive fatigue using machine learning algorithms. An experimental procedure was developed to effectively induce cognitive fatigue that included a close-to-real digital lesson and two standard cognitive tasks: Corsi-Block task and a concentration task. Machine learning models were user-tuned to account for the individual dynamics of each participant, reaching classification accuracy scores of around 70.91 \pm{} 13.67\%. We concluded that, although effective for some subjects, the methodology needs to be individually validated before being applied. Moreover, time on task was not a particularly determining factor for classification, i.e., to induce cognitive fatigue.

29,Can Variability of Brain Activity serve as a Metric for Assessing Human Performance during UAS Dual-Task Training,"Functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is an emerging mobile neuroimaging technology that monitors brain function through measures of cerebral hemodynamics, i.e., concentration of oxyhemoglobin (HbO) and deoxyhemoglobin (HbR). fNIRS measures are strongly associated with changes in cognitive effort and offer the ability to assess learning of complex tasks in realistic settings. However, much of this research has focused on investigating the effect of task load changes and training on average brain activity. Increasing empirical evidence has demonstrated that variability of brain activity changes can provide further understanding of cognitive effort and workload. However, there is limited research on evaluation of variability as a feature in fNIRS-related human factors studies, especially within the context of dual-task training. Therefore, this study aimed on evaluating variability of fNIRS measures during simulation-based training of a dual Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) operator task. fNIRS data was collected from 13 young adults who participated in five sessions of testing consisting of skill acquisition (three easy) and transfer (two hard) phases. Standard deviation (SD) and root mean squared successive differences (rMSSD) were used to represent variability. Firstly, variability increased within easy and hard sessions and decreased while transitioning from easy to hard sessions. Secondly, these changes were not only larger in magnitude, but were exactly opposite of those reported from average measures. Thirdly, variability was largest in left dorsolateral PFC (LDLPFC) and right anterior medial PFC (RAMPFC), which are the regions that are expected to have UAS task-evoked activity. Lastly, variability features did not differ between LDLPFC and RAMPFC, even though average did. In conclusion, these findings suggest that variability of fNIRS measures are not only sensitive to skill acquisition, practice, task load, transfer, and subject-specific differences in learning during UAS task training but offer complimentary information to that of typically reported average fNIRS measures. \textcopyright{} 2022 IEEE.",,,,,,TRUE,10.1109/ICHMS56717.2022.9980752,,,https://doi.org/10.1109/ICHMS56717.2022.9980752,10.1109__ICHMS56717.2022.9980752,,FALSE

The temperature, time, and sample volume involved in the dehydration process were optimized using design of experiments. Six different sample supports were assessed, being the thick couche paper the best support. NIR spectra from liquid (LSJ) and dehydrated sugarcane juice (DSJ) were obtained. Sucrose, glucose, and fructose in LSJ were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography with an evaporative light scattering detector (HPLC-ELSD). Sucrose, glucose, and fructose ranged from 99.29 to 249.27 ​mg/mL, 5.96–14.94 ​mg/mL and 3.99–16.10 ​mg/mL. PLS models were built using the sugars content and NIR spectra collected from a benchtop and a portable instrument. Ordered predictors selection (OPS) was applied to select the most informative variable. The results indicated better predictions for all sugars using the DSJ for both instruments, being the benchtop statistically better than the portable instrument. On the benchtop instrument, the PLS-OPS models presented root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) respectively for sucrose, glucose, and fructose 7.98, 0.82, and 1.00 ​mg/mL using the DSJ against 12.75, 1.00, and 1.35 ​mg/mL using the LSJ.

34,Detection and Tracking of Search and Rescue Personnel under Hindered Light Conditions Using Hyperspectral Imaging,"In the past two decades, advances in cost-effective fabrication techniques, miniature systems, intrinsic detectors and computing technology transformed hyperspectral imaging (HSI) from a bench-top scientific curiosity to a discipline with operational and fielded systems. Despite these advancements, there are still limitations such as degraded visual environment (DVE) conditions that reduce the visibility within a scene impacting HSI negatively. These conditions can be rain, haze or smoke and adversely affect the performance of the sensors by reducing their range of effectiveness in terms of detection, identification, and recognition. Additionally, benchmark detectors and classification techniques are mainly conducted on a pixel-wise basis which has proven to be a solid and effective technique but often isn't optimized for real-time detection of people or objects. This paper proposes a two-stage neural-net-based detector for real-time detection and tracking of firefighters subjected to DVEs using hyperspectral near-infrared (NIR) images. The proposed method first exploits the spatial features through object detection and then analyzes the extracted regions using a spectral-spatial pixel-wise algorithm to validate the presence of firefighters. The robustness of the proposed architecture is successfully demonstrated using various realistic scenarios. \textcopyright{} 2022 IEEE.",,,,,,TRUE,10.1109/WHISPERS56178.2022.9955101,,,https://doi.org/10.1109/WHISPERS56178.2022.9955101,10.1109__WHISPERS56178.2022.9955101,,FALSE
35,Detection of Falsified Antimalarial Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine and Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine Drugs Using a Low-Cost Handheld Near-Infrared Spectrometer,"Falsified drugs are of serious concern to public health worldwide, particularly for developing countries where quality control of drugs is inefficient. In law enforcement against such fake medicines, there is a need to develop reliable, fast, and inexpensive screening methods. In this work, the ability of an innovative low-cost handheld near-infrared spectrometer to identify falsifications among two antimalarial fixed dose combination tablets, dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine and sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine, has been investigated. Analyzed samples were collected in Burkina Faso mainly in rural transborder areas that could be infiltrated by illicit drugs. A principal component analysis was applied on the acquired near-infrared spectra to identify trends, similarities, and differences between collected samples. This allowed to detect some samples of dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine and sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine which seemed to be falsified. These suspicious samples were semiquantitatively analyzed by thin-layer chromatography using Minalab\textregistered{} kits. Obtained results allowed to confirm the falsifications since the suspected samples did not contain any of the expected active pharmaceutical ingredients. The capacity of the low-cost near-infrared device to identify specifically a brand name of dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine or sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine has been also studied using soft independent modelling of class analogy (SIMCA) in the classical and data driven versions. The built models allowed a clear brand identification with 100\% of both sensitivity and specificity in the studied cases. All these results demonstrate the potential of these low-cost near-infrared spectrometers to be used as first line screening tools, particularly in resource limited laboratories, for the detection of falsified antimalarial drugs. \textcopyright{} 2022 Moussa Yabr\'{e} et al.",,,,,,TRUE,10.1155/2022/5335936,,,https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/5335936,10.1155__2022__5335936,,FALSE

38,Development of Automatic Controlled Walking Assistive Device Based on Fatigue and Emotion Detection,"The world's aging population is increasing. The num-ber of elderly individuals having walking impairments is also increasing. Adequate exercise is becoming nec-essary for them. Therefore, several walking assistive devices have been developed or are under develop-ment. However, elderly individuals may have low motivation for exercising, or they may experience physical damage by excessive fatigue. This study proposed a method to enable elderly individuals to exercise with a positive emotion and prevent damage such as muscle fatigue. We proposed a 3D human condition model to control the walking assistive device. It includes the arousal, pleasure, and fatigue dimensions. With regard to the arousal and pleasure dimensions, we used heartbeat and electromyography (EEG) signals to train a deep neural network (DNN) model to iden-tify human emotions. For fatigue detection, we proposed a method based on near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to detect muscle fatigue. All the sensors are portable. This implies that it can be used for outdoor activities. Then, we proposed a walking strategy based on a 3D human condition model to control the walking assistive device. Finally, we tested the effective-ness of the automatic control system. The wearing of the walking assistive device and implementation of the walking strategy can delay the fatigue time by approx-imately 24\% and increase the walking distance by ap-proximately 16\%. In addition, we succeeded in visu-alizing the distribution of emotion during each walking method variation. It was verified that the walking strategy can improve the mental condition of a user to a certain extent. These results showed the effective-ness of the proposed system.

39,Development of Portable Near Infrared Spectroscopy Device and Its Application in Rapid Nondestructive Detection of Strawberry Quality,"In order to meet the demand for rapid detection of strawberry quality, we have developed a kind of portable near-infrared spectrometer. Near-infrared spectrograms of ""Tao Xun"" and ""Hong Yan"" strawberries were obtained in the range of 600~1100 nm, and the collected spectra were pretreated by multiplication scattering correction (MSC), standard normal variable transformation (SNV), savitzky-golay derivative (SG-DEV), savitzky-golay smooth (SG-smooth), normalization (NOR). Finally, multiple quality prediction models of strawberries were established with principal component analysis (PCA). The results showed that the pre-processed SSC prediction model of MSC was optimal, with high correlation coefficient (Rc = 0.91, Rp = 0.88) and small root mean square error (RMSEC = 0.43\%, RMSEP = 0.45\%); the preprocessed firmness prediction model of SG-DEV (width 5 points, fitting 3 times) was optimal, with high correlation coefficient (Rc = 0.92, Rp = 0.93) and small root mean square error (RMSEC = 1.20 N, RMSEP = 1.39N). Based on the WINCE development framework, a real-time analysis and control software for nondestructive testing was written, and predictive models of two varieties were added to the software to realize one-click operation of strawberry multi-quality parameter testing. In addition, the prediction model of strawberry quality was verified. The correlation coefficients of SSC model and firmness model were 0.93 and 0.95, respectively, and the root mean square error was 0.44\% and 1.15 N, respectively. Compared with traditional detection methods, it is fast and non-destructive, and is suitable for immediate detection by fruit farmers after picking.

Due to its higher level of commercial use, the species has a huge array of varieties/cultivars. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of visible near-infrared (Vis-NIR) spectroscopy in combination with multiple chemometric approaches for distinguishing four B. juncea varieties in Korea. The spectra from the leaves of four different growth stages of four B. juncea varieties were measured in the Vis-NIR range of 325–1075 nm with a stepping of 1.5 nm in reflectance mode. For effective discrimination, the spectral data were preprocessed using three distinct approaches, and eight different chemometric analyses were utilized. After the detection of outliers, the samples were split into two groups, one serving as a calibration set and the other as a validation set. When numerous preprocessing and chemometric approaches were applied for discriminating, the combination of standard normal variate and deep learning had the highest classification accuracy in all the growth stages achieved up to 100\%. Similarly, few other chemometrics also yielded 100\% classification accuracy, namely, support vector machine, generalized linear model, and the random forest. Of all the chemometric preprocessing methods, Savitzky–Golay filter smoothing provided the best and most convincing discrimination.

Gene flow from GM crops to other crops, especially in the Brassicaceae family, might pose a threat to the environment due to their weediness. Hence, finding reliable, quick, and low-cost methods to detect and monitor the presence of GM crops and crop products is important. In this study, we used visible near-infrared (Vis-NIR) spectroscopy for the effective discrimination of GM and non-GM Brassica napus, B. rapa, and F1 hybrids (B. rapa X GM B. napus). Initially, Vis-NIR spectra were collected from the plants, and the spectra were preprocessed. A combination of different preprocessing methods (four methods) and various modeling approaches (eight methods) was used for effective discrimination. Among the different combinations, the Savitzky-Golay and Support Vector Machine combination was found to be an optimal model in the discrimination of GM, non-GM, and hybrid plants with the highest accuracy rate (100\%). The use of a Convolutional Neural Network with Normalization resulted in 98.9\%. The same higher accuracy was found in the use of Gradient Boosted Trees and Fast Large Margin approaches. Later, phenolic acid concentration among the different plants was assessed using GC-MS analysis. Partial least squares regression analysis of Vis-NIR spectra and biochemical characteristics showed significant correlations in their respective changes. The results showed that handheld Vis-NIR spectroscopy combined with chemometric analyses could be used for the effective discrimination of GM and non-GM B. napus, B. rapa, and F1 hybrids.

Accordingly, the assessment of the spirit status of the driver through the eyes blinking frequency and the measurement of physiological signals have emerged as effective methods. In this study, a drowsiness detection system is proposed to combine the detection of LF/HF ratio from heart rate variability (HRV) of photoplethysmographic imaging (PPGI) and percentage of eyelid closure over the pupil over time (PERCLOS), and to utilize the advantages of both methods to improve the accuracy and robustness of drowsiness detection. The proposed algorithm performs three functions, including LF/HF ratio from HRV status judgment, eye state detection, and drowsiness judgment. In addition, this study utilized a near-infrared webcam to obtain a facial image to achieve non-contact measurement, alleviate the inconvenience of using a contact wearable device, and for use in a dark environment. Furthermore, we selected the appropriate RGB channel under different light sources to obtain LF/HF ratio from HRV of PPGI.

For these reasons, in 2019, textiles were identified as a ``priority product category for the circular economy'' by the European Commission that proposed a new circular economy action plan focusing on recycling. An in-depth characterization of textile fabrics could lead to an ad hoc recycling procedure, reducing resource consumption and chemicals utilization. In this work, NIR (1000–1650 nm) spectroscopy was applied to extract information regarding fabric composition, with reference to cotton, silk, viscose, and some of their blends, using two different devices: a hyperspectral imaging (HSI) platform and a portable spectroradiometer. The different fabrics were correctly classified based on their spectral features by both detection instruments.

During surgical skill acquisition, novices need to learn from errors due to perturbations in their performance which is one of the basic principles of motor skill acquisition. This study on thirteen healthy novice medical students and nine expert surgeons aimed to capture the brain state during error epochs using multimodal brain imaging by combining functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and electroencephalography (EEG). We performed error-related microstate analysis in the latent space that was found using regularized temporally embedded Canonical Correlation Analysis from fNIRS-EEG recordings during the performance of FLS 'suturing and intracorporeal knot-tying' task - the most difficult among the five psychomotor FLS tasks.

47,Error-related brain state analysis using electroencephalography in conjunction with functional near-infrared spectroscopy during a complex surgical motor task,"Error-based learning is one of the basic skill acquisition mechanisms that can be modeled as a perception–action system and investigated based on brain–behavior analysis during skill training. Here, the error-related chain of mental processes is postulated to depend on the skill level leading to a difference in the contextual switching of the brain states on error commission. Therefore, the objective of this paper was to compare error-related brain states, measured with multi-modal portable brain imaging, between experts and novices during the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) ``suturing and intracorporeal knot-tying'' task (FLS complex task)--the most difficult among the five psychomotor FLS tasks. The multi-modal portable brain imaging combined functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and electroencephalography (EEG) for brain–behavior analysis in thirteen right-handed novice medical students and nine expert surgeons. The brain state changes were defined by quasi-stable EEG scalp topography (called microstates) changes using 32-channel EEG data acquired at 250~Hz. Six microstate prototypes were identified from the combined EEG data from experts and novices during the FLS complex task that explained 77.14{\%} of the global variance. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) found that the proportion of the total time spent in different microstates during the 10-s error epoch was significantly affected by the skill level (p {\textless} 0.01), the microstate type (p {\textless} 0.01), and the interaction between the skill level and the microstate type (p {\textless} 0.01). Brain activation based on the slower oxyhemoglobin (HbO) changes corresponding to the EEG band power (1–40~Hz) changes were found using the regularized temporally embedded Canonical Correlation Analysis of the simultaneously acquired fNIRS–EEG signals. The HbO signal from the overlying the left inferior frontal gyrus--opercular part, left superior frontal gyrus--medial orbital, left postcentral gyrus, left superior temporal gyrus, right superior frontal gyrus--medial orbital cortical areas showed significant (p {\textless} 0.05) difference between experts and novices in the 10-s error epoch. We conclude that the difference in the error-related chain of mental processes was the activation of cognitive top-down attention-related brain areas, including left dorsolateral prefrontal/frontal eye field and left frontopolar brain regions, along with a `focusing' effect of global suppression of hemodynamic activation in the experts, while the novices had a widespread stimulus(error)-driven hemodynamic activation without the `focusing' effect.",,,,,,TRUE,10.1186/s40708-022-00179-z,,,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40708-022-00179-z,10.1186__s40708-022-00179-z,,FALSE

The purpose of this study was to evaluate two portable spectrophotometers to predict key soil properties such as texture and soil organic carbon (SOC) in 282 soil samples collected from proportional fields in four Canadian provinces. Of the two instruments, one was the first of its kind (prototype) and was a mid-infrared (mid-IR) spectrophotometer operating between ~5500 and ~11,000 nm. The other instrument was a readily available dual-type spectrophotometer having a spectral range in both visible (vis) and near-infrared (NIR) regions with wavelengths ranging between ~400 and ~2220 nm. A large number of soil samples (n = 282) were used to represent a wide variety of soil textures, from clay loam to sandy soils, with a considerable range of SOC. These samples were subjected to routine laboratory soil analysis before both spectrophotometers were used to collect diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) measurements. After data collection, the mid-IR and vis-NIR spectra were randomly divided into calibration (70\%) and validation (30\%) sets. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) was used with leave one out cross-validation techniques to derive the spectral calibrations to predict SOC, sand, and clay content. The performances of the calibration models were reevaluated on the validation set. It was found that sand content can be predicted more accurately using the portable mid-IR spectrophotometer and clay content is better predicted using the readily available dual-type vis-NIR spectrophotometer. The coefficients of determination (R2) and root mean squared error (RMSE) were determined to be most favorable for clay (0.82 and 78 g kg-1) and sand (0.82 and 103 g kg-1), respectively. The ability to predict SOC content precisely was not particu-larly good for the dataset of soils used in this study with an R2 and RMSE of 0.54 and 4.1 g kg-1.

However, why and how humans have this distinctive ability to perceive music remains unclear. Additionally, the investigation of the innate perceiving skill in humans is compounded by the fact that we have been actively and passively exposed to auditory stimuli or have systematically learnt music after birth. Therefore, to explore the innate musical perceiving ability, infants with preterm birth may be the most suitable population. In this study, the auditory brain networks were explored using dynamic functional connectivity-based reliable component analysis (RCA) in preterm infants during music listening. The brain activation was captured by portable functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to simulate a natural environment for preterm infants. The components with the maximum inter-subject correlation were extracted. The generated spatial filters identified the shared spatial structural features of functional brain connectivity across subjects during listening to the common music, exhibiting a functional synchronization between the right temporal region and the frontal and motor cortex, and synchronization between the bilateral temporal regions. The specific pattern is responsible for the functions involving music comprehension, emotion generation, language processing, memory, and sensory. The fluctuation of the extracted components and the phase variation demonstrates the interactions between the extracted brain networks to encode musical information.

We found a significant (p<0.01) difference in the PFC activation between elderly subjects with T2DM and age-matched elderly controls. Moreover, power spectral density (PSD) analysis revealed a significantly lower relative power in 0.021-0.052 Hz (smooth muscle autonomic innervation) frequency band in elderly subjects with T2DM during the Mini-Cog three-item recall test. Furthermore, a drop in the oscillatory power in the 0.01-0.02 Hz frequency band during Mini-Cog three-item recall test was found more pronounced in the elderly subjects with T2DM. Therefore, our study highlighted portable brain imaging to capture cerebrovascular reactivity to cognitive load that may provide a biomarker of cerebrovascular dysfunction in T2DM.

59,Handheld NIR Spectral Sensor Module Based on a Fully-Integrated Detector Array,"For decades, near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy has been a valuable tool for material analysis in a variety of applications, ranging from industrial process monitoring to quality assessment. Traditional spectrometers are typically bulky, fragile and expensive, which makes them unsuitable for portable and in-field use. Thus, there is a growing interest for miniaturized, robust and low-cost NIR sensors. In this study, we demonstrate a handheld NIR spectral sensor module, based on a fully-integrated multipixel detector array, sensitive in the 850–1700 nm wavelength range. Differently from a spectrometer, the spectral sensor measures a limited number of NIR spectral bands. The capabilities of the spectral sensor module were evaluated alongside a commercially available portable spectrometer for two application cases: to quantify the moisture content in rice grains and to classify plastic types. Both devices achieved the two sensing tasks with comparable performance. Moisture quantification was achieved with a root mean square error (RMSE) prediction of 1.4\% and 1.1\% by the spectral sensor and spectrometer, respectively. Classification of the plastic type was achieved with a prediction accuracy on unknown samples of 100\% and 96.4\% by the spectral sensor and spectrometer, respectively. The results from this study are promising and demonstrate the potential for the compact NIR modules to be used in a variety of NIR sensing applications. \textcopyright{} 2022 by the authors.",,,,,,TRUE,10.3390/s22187027,,,https://doi.org/10.3390/s22187027,10.3390__s22187027,,FALSE
62,Identification of Ischemic Stroke Condition Based on Hemodynamic Biomarkers,"Ischemic stroke is a cerebral hemodynamic disorder that occurs due to the impairment of hemoglobin supply to the tissue, a leading cause of mortality around the world. This research focuses on detecting ischemic stroke conditions by adding new hemodynamic biomarker information to the proposed low-cost wearable point-of-care diagnostic near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) device. Consequently, a new protocol-based sequence of experiments has been carried out to detect the ischemic condition. First, a multichannel, multiwavelength, and multibiomarkers-based point-of-care NIRS system has been developed to accommodate these features onboard. A four-wavelength, six-optode channels-based NIRS probe has been designed such that the physiological noise gets minimized and covers 100 mm $\times20$ mm area of tissue, for example, the frontal lobe of the brain, with near and far distance concept of optode channels. Infinite impulse response (IIR) filters have been used onboard to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) up to 58.17 dB of the measured biomarker signal. The proposed pipeline of in-vivo occlusion experimentation evoked the ischemic condition at various stages to validate the system performance and temporal characteristics of biomarkers. First, basic PPG signals have recorded to test the performance of the device against the standard PPG signal, then the device has been placed a little upward from the finger to the forearm, where forearm occlusion has been done to mimic the ischemic condition, and finally, the device has been moved further upward and placed at the frontal lobe to record the evoked ischemic biomarker's response while blocking the carotid artery.",,,,,,TRUE,10.1109/JSEN.2022.3196497,,,https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2022.3196497,10.1109__JSEN.2022.3196497,,FALSE
63,Individual differences in skill acquisition and transfer assessed by dual task training performance and brain activity,"Assessment of expertise development during training program primarily consists of evaluating interactions between task characteristics, performance, and mental load. Such a traditional assessment framework may lack consideration of individual characteristics when evaluating training on complex tasks, such as driving and piloting, where operators are typically required to execute multiple tasks simultaneously. Studies have already identified individual characteristics arising from intrinsic, context, strategy, personality, and preference as common predictors of performance and mental load. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the effect of individual difference in skill acquisition and transfer using an ecologically valid dual task, behavioral, and brain activity measures. Specifically, we implemented a search and surveillance task (scanning and identifying targets) using a high-fidelity training simulator for the unmanned aircraft sensor operator, acquired behavioral measures (scan, not scan, over scan, and adaptive target find scores) using simulator-based analysis module, and measured brain activity changes (oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin) from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) using a portable functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) sensor array. The experimental protocol recruited 13 novice participants and had them undergo three easy and two hard sessions to investigate skill acquisition and transfer, respectively. Our results from skill acquisition sessions indicated that performance on both tasks did not change when individual differences were not accounted for. However inclusion of individual differences indicated that some individuals improved only their scan performance (Attention-focused group), while others improved only their target find performance (Accuracy-focused group). Brain activity changes during skill acquisition sessions showed that mental load decreased in the right anterior medial PFC (RAMPFC) in both groups regardless of individual differences. However, mental load increased in the left anterior medial PFC (LAMPFC) of Attention-focused group and decreased in the Accuracy-focused group only when individual differences were included. Transfer results showed no changes in performance regardless of grouping based on individual differences; however, mental load increased in RAMPFC of Attention-focused group and left dorsolateral PFC (LDLPFC) of Accuracy-focused group. Efficiency and involvement results suggest that the Attention-focused group prioritized the scan task, while the Accuracy-focused group prioritized the target find task. In conclusion, training on multitasks results in individual differences. These differences may potentially be due to individual preference. Future studies should incorporate individual differences while assessing skill acquisition and transfer during multitask training.",,,,,,TRUE,10.1186/s40708-022-00157-5,,,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40708-022-00157-5,10.1186__s40708-022-00157-5,,FALSE
65,"InfraredTags: Embedding Invisible AR Markers and Barcodes Using Low-Cost, Infrared-Based 3D Printing and Imaging Tools","Existing approaches for embedding unobtrusive tags inside 3D objects require either complex fabrication or high-cost imaging equipment. We present InfraredTags, which are 2D markers and barcodes imperceptible to the naked eye that can be 3D printed as part of objects, and detected rapidly by low-cost near-infrared cameras. We achieve this by printing objects from an infrared-transmitting filament, which infrared cameras can see through, and by having air gaps inside for the tag's bits, which appear at a different intensity in the infrared image. We built a user interface that facilitates the integration of common tags (QR codes, ArUco markers) with the object geometry to make them 3D printable as InfraredTags. We also developed a low-cost infrared imaging module that augments existing mobile devices and decodes tags using our image processing pipeline. Our evaluation shows that the tags can be detected with little near-infrared illumination (0.2lux) and from distances as far as 250cm.

69,Metamaterial-Based Sensor Integrating Microwave Dielectric and Near-Infrared Spectroscopy Techniques for Substance Evaluation,"A novel era of ``smart'' sensors is emerging, in which they are being used in combination with artificial intelligence (AI) to achieve a better understanding of the world. Such sensors need to be ubiquitous. Accordingly, they should have miniaturized dimensions and low costs. However, there is a tradeoff between cost and accuracy of the sensors, which should be overcome with the use of new types of sensors and techniques. In this article, a metamaterial-based sensor that performs simultaneous microwave dielectric spectroscopy and near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy measurements is presented. It uses a planar circular complementary split-ring resonator for dielectric measurement with an optical path, and NIR spectroscopy is performed in the same physical structure. A greater diversity of data can be achieved from the electromagnetic spectrum using the data from microwave dielectric spectroscopy and NIR spectroscopy; thus, it becomes possible to enhance the accuracy of substance identification with fewer samples. The proposed sensor was evaluated for the identification of olive oil adulteration and achieved an accuracy of 100\% using only 14 training samples. To achieve this same accuracy, other techniques used for the detection of adulteration in olive oil need more than 50 training samples. Therefore, the proposed sensor needs 72\% fewer samples for training classifier algorithms used in olive oil adulteration identification. This implies the reduction of computing requirements and wall clock time. The proposed sensor opens new avenues to perform material characterization and identification using a combination of microwave dielectric and NIR spectroscopies in the same structure.",,,,,,TRUE,10.1109/JSEN.2022.3202708,,,https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2022.3202708,10.1109__JSEN.2022.3202708,,FALSE
71,Monitoring Time-Non-Stable Surfaces Using Mobile NIR DLP Spectroscopy,"In recent years, Near Infrared (NIR) spectroscopy has increased in popularity and usage for different purposes, including the detection of particular substances, evaluation of food quality, etc. Usually, mobile handheld NIR spectroscopy devices are used on the surfaces of different materials, very often organic ones. The features of these materials change as they age, leading to changes in their spectra. The ageing process often occurs only slowly, i.e., corresponding reflection spectra can be analyzed each hour or at an even longer interval. This paper undertakes the problem of analyzing surfaces of non-stable, rapidly changing materials such as waxes or adhesive materials. To obtain their characteristic spectra, NIR spectroscopy using a Digital Light Projection (DLP) spectrometer was used. Based on earlier experiences and the current state of the art, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) were used to process spectral sequences to proceed with an enormous value of spectra gathered during measurements. \textcopyright{} 2022 by the authors.

72,Motion Artifacts Correction from EEG and fNIRS Signals Using Novel Multiresolution Analysis,"Physiological signal measurement and processing are increasingly becoming popular in the ambulatory setting as the hospital-centric treatment is moving towards wearable and ubiquitous monitoring. Most of the physiological signals are highly susceptible to various types of noises, especially movement artifacts. The electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals are no exception to motion artifacts, which become prominent in the ambulatory setting. Since successful detection of various neurological disorders is greatly dependent upon clean EEG and fNIRS signals, it is a matter of utmost importance to remove motion artifacts from these two signal modalities using reliable and robust methods. This paper proposes three novel multiresolution analysis techniques: i) Variational mode decomposition (VMD), ii) VMD in combination with principal component analysis (VMD-PCA), and iii) VMD in combination with canonical correlation analysis (VMD-CCA), for motion artifact correction from single-channel EEG and fNIRS signals. The efficacy of these novel techniques is validated by computing the difference in the signal to noise ratio ( $\Delta SNR$ ) and percentage reduction in motion artifacts ( \$\eta\$ ). Among the three proposed novel methods, VMD-CCA decomposed with 15 intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) has shown the best denoising performance for EEG signals producing an average \$\Delta SNR\$ and \$\eta \$ values of 23.81 dB and 57.01\%, respectively for all 23 EEG recordings. On the other hand, for the available 16 fNIRS recordings, VMD-CCA decomposed with 10 IMFs produced an average \$\Delta SNR\$ and \$\eta \$ values of 15.97 dB and 39.01\%, respectively. The results reported using the proposed methods outperform most of the existing state-of-the-art techniques. \textcopyright{} 2013 IEEE.",,,,,,TRUE,10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3159155,,,https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3159155,10.1109__ACCESS.2022.3159155,,FALSE
73,Motion Artifacts Correction from Single-Channel EEG and fNIRS Signals Using Novel Wavelet Packet Decomposition in Combination with Canonical Correlation Analysis,"The electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals, highly non-stationary in nature, greatly suffers from motion artifacts while recorded using wearable sensors. Since successful detection of various neurological and neuromuscular disorders is greatly dependent upon clean EEG and fNIRS signals, it is a matter of utmost importance to remove/reduce motion artifacts from EEG and fNIRS signals using reliable and robust methods. In this regard, this paper proposes two robust methods: (i) Wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) and (ii) WPD in combination with canonical correlation analysis (WPD-CCA), for motion artifact correction from single-channel EEG and fNIRS signals. The efficacy of these proposed techniques is tested using a benchmark dataset and the performance of the proposed methods is measured using two wellestablished performance matrices: (i) difference in the signal to noise ratio (∆SNR) and (ii) percentage reduction in motion artifacts (\ensuremath{\eta}). The proposed WPD-based single-stage motion artifacts correction technique produces the highest average ∆SNR (29.44 dB) when db2 wavelet packet is incorporated whereas the greatest average \ensuremath{\eta} (53.48\%) is obtained using db1 wavelet packet for all the available 23 EEG recordings. Our proposed two-stage motion artifacts correction technique, i.e., the WPD-CCA method utilizing db1 wavelet packet has shown the best denoising performance producing an average ∆SNR and \ensuremath{\eta} values of 30.76 dB and 59.51\%, respectively, for all the EEG recordings. On the other hand, for the available 16 fNIRS recordings, the two-stage motion artifacts removal technique, i.e., WPD-CCA has produced the best average ∆SNR (16.55 dB, utilizing db1 wavelet packet) and largest average \ensuremath{\eta} (41.40\%, using fk8 wavelet packet). The highest average ∆SNR and \ensuremath{\eta} using single-stage artifacts removal techniques (WPD) are found as 16.11 dB and 26.40\%, respectively, for all the fNIRS signals using fk4 wavelet packet. In both EEG and fNIRS modalities, the percentage reduction in motion artifacts increases by 11.28\% and 56.82\%, respectively when two-stage WPD-CCA techniques are employed in comparison with the single-stage WPD method. In addition, the average ∆SNR also increases when WPD-CCA techniques are used instead of single-stage WPD for both EEG and fNIRS signals. The increment in both ∆SNR and \ensuremath{\eta} values is a clear indication that two-stage WPD-CCA performs relatively better compared to single-stage WPD. The results reported using the proposed methods outperform most of the existing state-of-the-art techniques. \textcopyright{} 2022 by the authors.

74,Multi-models with averaging in feature domain for non-invasive blood glucose estimation,"Diabetes is a serious chronic metabolic disease. In the recent years, more and more studies focus on the use of the non-invasive methods to achieve the blood glucose estimation. More and more consumer technology enterprises focusing on human health are committed to implementing accurate and non-invasive blood glucose algorithm in their products. The near infrared spectroscopy built in the wearable devices is one of the common approaches to achieve the non-invasive blood glucose estimation. However, due to the interference from the external environment, these wearable non-invasive methods yield the low estimation accuracy. Even if it is not medical equipment, as a consumer product, the detection accuracy will also be an important indicator for consumers. To address this issue, this paper employs different models based on different ranges of the blood glucose values for performing the blood glucose estimation. First the photoplethysmograms (PPGs) are acquired and they are denoised via the bit plane singular spectrum analysis (SSA) method. Second, the features are extracted. For the data in the training set, first the features are averaged across the measurements in the feature domain via the optimization approach. Second, the random forest is employed to sort the importance of each feature. Third, the training set is divided into three subsets according to the reference blood glucose values. Fourth, the feature vectors and the corresponding blood glucose values in the same group are employed to build an individual model. Fifth, for each feature, the average of the feature values for all the measurements in the same subset is computed. For the data in the test set, first, the sum of the weighted distances between the test feature values and the average values obtained in the above is computed for each model. Here, the weights are defined based on the importance sorted by the random forest obtained in the above. The model corresponding to the smallest sum is assigned. Finally, the blood glucose value is estimated based on the corresponding model. Compared to the state of arts methods, our proposed method can effectively improve the estimation accuracy. In particular, the mean absolute relative difference (MARD) and the percentage of the data fall in the zone A of the Clarke error grid yielded by our proposed method reaches 12.19\%, and 87.0588\%, respectively.",,,,,,TRUE,10.1109/ISPCE-ASIA57917.2022.9971019,,,https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPCE-ASIA57917.2022.9971019,10.1109__ISPCE-ASIA57917.2022.9971019,,FALSE

The measurement is carried out in a sequence, and the reflected signal is pre-processed to be put in the machine learning algorithm. The support vector machine algorithm is used together with three different types of data normalization.

The sensor setup is applied to a laboratory scale separatory funnel. It uses a near infrared sensor array which receives light going through the liquids inside the funnel, which are illuminated by a light source located on the other side and below the funnel. Light refracts inside the funnel and the liquids and reflects on the interface creating changing patterns in the light intensity measured by the sensor, providing a way of locating the liquid-liquid interface. Liquid mixes with different optical features, from transparent to opaque, emulsion and clean, are used to test whether different types of interfaces produce a distinguishable response on the sensor, allowing to detect interfaces in different situations that can occur as part of an Artificial Intelligence orchestrated battery chemical synthesis process. Emulsion interfaces create a discernible change in the sensor input by lowering the light intensity registered when crossing in front of the sensor making them easier to locate than with other optical techniques. The setup opens the possibility of detecting a liquid-liquid interface as it is forming and can be miniaturized to be attached to laboratory funnels as a manual aid or used with other transparent vessels in automatic solutions like liquid handling robots or pipetting robots.",,,,,,TRUE,10.1109/JSEN.2022.3164188,,,https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2022.3164188,10.1109__JSEN.2022.3164188,,FALSE

83,Near-Infrared Sensors for Onsite and Noninvasive Quantification of Macronutrients in Breast Milk,"Breast milk is an optimal food that covers all the nutritional needs of the newborn. It is a dynamic fluid whose composition varies with lactation period. The neonatal units of hospitals have human milk banks, a service that analyzes, stores, and distributes donated human milk. This milk is used to feed premature infants (born before 32 weeks of gestation or weighing less than 1500 g) whose mothers, for some reason, cannot feed them with their own milk. Here, we aimed to develop near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) measures for the analysis of breast milk. For this purpose, we used a portable NIRS instrument scanning in the range of 1396–2396 nm to collect the spectra of milk samples. Then, different chemometrics were calculated to develop 18 calibration models with and without using derivatives and the standard normal variate. Once the calibration models were developed, the best treatments were selected according to the correlation coefficients (r2 ) and prediction errors (SECVs). The best results for the assayed macronutrients were obtained when no pre-treatment was applied to the NIR spectra of fat (r2 = 0.841, SECV = 0.51), raw protein (r2 = 0.512, SECV = 0.21), and carbohydrates (r2 = 0.741, SECV = 1.35). SNV plus the first derivative was applied to obtain satisfactory results for energy (r2 = 0.830, SECV = 9.60) quantification. The interpretation of the obtained results showed the richness of the NIRS spectra; moreover, the presence of specific bands for fat provided excellent statistics in quantitative models. These results demonstrated the ability of portable NIRS sensors in a methodology developed for the quality control of macronutri-ents in breast milk. \textcopyright{} 2022 by the authors.

84,NIR Instruments and Prediction Methods for Rapid Access to Grain Protein Content in Multiple Cereals,"Achieving global goals for sustainable nutrition, health, and wellbeing will depend on delivering enhanced diets to humankind. This will require instantaneous access to information on food-source quality at key points of agri-food systems. Although laboratory analysis and benchtop NIR spectrometers are regularly used to quantify grain quality, these do not suit all end users, for example, stakeholders in decentralized agri-food chains that are typical in emerging economies. Therefore, we explored benchtop and portable NIR instruments, and the methods that might aid these particular end uses. For this purpose, we generated NIR spectra for 328 grain samples from multiple cereals (finger millet, foxtail millet, maize, pearl millet, and sorghum) with a standard benchtop NIR spectrometer (DS2500, FOSS) and a novel portable NIR-based instrument (HL-EVT5, Hone). We explored classical deterministic methods (via winISI, FOSS), novel machine learning (ML)-driven methods (via Hone Create, Hone), and a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based method for building the calibrations to predict grain protein out of the NIR spectra. All of the tested methods enabled us to build relevant calibrations out of both types of spectra (i.e., R2 \geq{} 0.90, RMSE \leq{} 0.91, RPD \geq{} 3.08). Generally, the calibration methods integrating the ML techniques tended to enhance the prediction capacity of the model. We also documented that the prediction of grain protein content based on the NIR spectra generated using the novel portable instrument (HL-EVT5, Hone) was highly relevant for quantitative protein predictions (R2 = 0.91, RMSE = 0.97, RPD = 3.48). Thus, the presented findings lay the foundations for the expanded use of NIR spectroscopy in agricultural research, development, and trade. \textcopyright{} 2022 by the authors.

Most existing solutions use image-processing techniques to identify the food type and refer to the nutrition table to compute the total calorie, which is quite challenging to differentiate foods that look the same but contain vastly different quantities of calories. To address this issue, we propose to leverage near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to derive the concentration of nutrients based on the unique absorption spectrum of foods. Instead of using the professional NIRS system that is bulky, expensive, and impractical for daily use by nonexpert users, we develop a low-cost portable NIRS system using commercial LEDs. As the quality of the signals of the low-power LEDs is relatively poor, we carefully design modulation schemes and interference elimination algorithms to improve the signal quality and remove the interference.

92,Optical Monitoring of Breathing Patterns and Tissue Oxygenation: A Potential Application in COVID-19 Screening and Monitoring,"The worldwide outbreak of the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) has highlighted the need for a screening and monitoring system for infectious respiratory diseases in the acute and chronic phase. The purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility of using a wearable near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) sensor to collect respiratory signals and distinguish between normal and simulated pathological breathing. Twenty-one healthy adults participated in an experiment that examined five separate breathing conditions. Respiratory signals were collected with a continuous-wave NIRS sensor (PortaLite, Artinis Medical Systems) affixed over the sternal manubrium. Following a three-minute baseline, participants began five minutes of imposed difficult breathing using a respiratory trainer. After a five minute recovery period, participants began five minutes of imposed rapid and shallow breathing. The study concluded with five additional minutes of regular breathing. NIRS signals were analyzed using a machine learning model to distinguish between normal and simulated pathological breathing. Three features: breathing interval, breathing depth, and O2Hb signal amplitude were extracted from the NIRS data and, when used together, resulted in a weighted average accuracy of 0.87. This study demonstrated that a wearable NIRS sensor can monitor respiratory patterns continuously and non-invasively and we identified three respiratory features that can distinguish between normal and simulated pathological breathing. \textcopyright{} 2022 by the authors.",,,,,,TRUE,10.3390/s22197274,,,https://doi.org/10.3390/s22197274,10.3390__s22197274,,FALSE
95,Portable FT-NIR spectroscopic sensor for detection of chemical precursors of explosives using advanced prediction algorithms,"Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy has acquired widespread adoption in various sectors as a result of its benefits over other analytical techniques, the most notable of which is the ability to record spectra for solid samples without any prior manipulation. Furthermore, advances in instrumentation have led to the creation of compact and high-speed spectrometers that can be used in a variety of scenarios, including hazardous materials identification. Fourier Transform NIR (FT-NIR) technology is one of the most useful tools for onsite analysis of chemical and biological substances. Herein, we propose a compact, portable FT-NIR spectroscopic sensor for field measurements, based on commercial broadband light source and spectrometer for detection of chemical precursors of explosives. We mainly focus on four compounds, ammonium nitrate, potassium nitrate, sodium nitrate and urea, some of the best-known chemical precursors of explosives with NIR content. A customized spectral library is constructed, including the forementioned substances under different environmental conditions. We emphasize on two basic factors that can affect the NIR spectra: the relative humidity and the ambient temperature. For the unknown spectrum identification, we evaluate prediction models which involve the use of Random Forest and Support Vector Machine, as well as the Hit Quality Index (HQI) value. The FT-NIR spectroscopic sensor additionally includes an integrated communication module that provides measurement spectra and results to a novel edge computing platform, called DECIoT. We demonstrate the operation of the FT-NIR spectroscopic sensor in real settings under humidity, straight sunlight, and temperature fluctuations, achieving maximum accuracy of 0.96. \textcopyright{} 2022 SPIE.",,,,,,TRUE,10.1117/12.2624004,,,https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2624004,10.1117__12.2624004,,FALSE
96,Portable Near-Infrared Spectroscopy as a Screening Test of Corrosive Solutions Concealed in Plastic Containers,"The use of corrosive substances for criminal intent has recently increased in many countries, with 619 violent assaults recorded from 2019 to 2020 only in the UK. Criminals often conceal corrosive solutions, such as common household cleaners, in inconspicuous plastic bottles and splashing the content in order to incapacitate a victim while committing a robbery or to cause physical harm. There is currently no method available to law enforcement for the safe identification of these corrosive substances without being exposed to them. In this work, the feasibility of a near infrared (NIR) handheld spectrometer for the screening of corrosive inorganic solutions through plastic bottles is investigated. First, a training set comprising samples of five different corrosives was used to build a spectral library for data analysis and chemometric model design. Four models were then tested on three hundred samples of corrosive substances, as well as harmless substances such as water and soft drinks, to evaluate their performance. The models designed identified the corrosive substances in scenarios of concentrated solutions, showcasing the potential capability of this technique for the pre-screening of corrosive substances. \textcopyright{} 2022 by the authors.

97,Prediction of Soil Available Boron Content in Visible-Near-Infrared Hyperspectral Based on Different Preprocessing Transformations and Characteristic Wavelengths Modeling,"The trace element boron (Boron, B) is an important factor in crops' development, pollination, and fertilization. Available boron (AB) in soil is the main source of boron nutrient absorption for crops. Rapid detection of AB is of great significance for crop nutrition diagnosis, soil testing and fertilization, precision agriculture development, scientific production management, and guarantee of stable yield and high quality. In this study, we propose a new method to predict soil available boron content using handheld nonimaging hyperspectroscopy in the visible-near-infrared range (350-1655 nm). As boron content is one of the fewest soil chemical elements, a rapid and accurate method has yet to be developed to detect and quantify the soil available boron. Visible-near-infrared ray (VIS-NIR) spectroscopy is widely utilized in the detection and quantification of soil available nutrients. There is, however, scant research on the detection of soil boron based on NIR data, and the performance of current regression model is still far from satisfactory. Our soil samples were collected from southern Anhui, China, with their NIR spectroscopy examined and the NIR data pretreated by 29 transformations and modeled with 10 regression algorithms. Of all the tested methods, SVM\_RBF, BPNN, and PLS\_RBF algorithms demonstrated the best performance and gave 0.80\sim{}0.82 coefficient of determination value. At the same time, Random Forest algorithm (RFA), Successive Projection Algorithm (SPA), and Variable Importance in Projection (VIP) were used to extract the spectral characteristic wavelength data of soil available boron, and then the characteristic wavelength data were modeled with three regression algorithms: SVM\_RBF, PLS\_RBF, and BPNN. A comparative analysis of the prediction performance (R2, RPD, RMSE, and RPIQ) of the models established at the full band showed that the RFA-MSC/BPNN model achieved the best performance. Compared with the best full-wavelength model DT/SVM\_RBF, the test set achieved a 3.06\% increase in R2, a 7.12\% drop in RMSE, a 7.71\% gain in RPD, and a 7.78\% increase in RPIQ.

We consider investigating the circumstances under which accidents occur on narrow roads to be an important research task. Statistics from the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department indicate that the number of traffic accident fatalities in winter is relatively high. We used a Driving Simulator (DS) in order to safely perform sensing on roads that replicate a local city in a heavy snowfall region. Brain activity during driving was measured using a portable functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) device. We used a machine-learning algorithm for analyzing time-series datasets to demonstrate differences in brain activity across driving events. We classified subjects into four groups based on the results of questionnaires that assessed their driving characteristics. Experimentally obtained results demonstrated that Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) changes that represent increased brain activity were greater in winter than in summer for each event. We infer that the winter events had a larger impact on the drivers. \textcopyright{} 2022 ICROS.,,,,,,TRUE,10.23919/ICCAS55662.2022.10003878,,,https://doi.org/10.23919/ICCAS55662.2022.10003878,10.23919__ICCAS55662.2022.10003878,,FALSE

Nowadays, the methods to measure soil macronutrient is still a relatively long time method, whereas it needs to be done as soon as possible. The rapid prediction system of the soil macronutrinet measurement is needed. The rapid prediction system requires the model of low energy consumption to apply on the portable mini computer. Most of the current researchs produce the model which requires the high energy consumption. This study aims to compare the performance of several machine learning (ML) algorithms in processing near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) signals with the application of several preprocessing techniques to get the best one to perform in the rapid predicition system to produce the low energy consumption model. Spectrum data is preprocessed using a random over-sampling technique and principal component analysis (PCA) of four number of principle components (PCs), 3, 5, 7, and 10.

100,Rapid Detection of Fraudulent Rice Using Low-Cost Digital Sensing Devices and Machine Learning,"Rice fraud is one of the common threats to the rice industry. Conventional methods to detect rice adulteration are costly, time-consuming, and tedious. This study proposes the quantitative prediction of rice adulteration levels measured through the packaging using a handheld near-infrared (NIR) spectrometer and electronic nose (e-nose) sensors measuring directly on samples and paired with machine learning (ML) algorithms. For these purposes, the samples were prepared by mixing rice at different ratios from 0\% to 100\% with a 10\% increment based on the rice's weight, consisting of (i) rice from different origins, (ii) premium with regular rice, (iii) aromatic with non-aromatic, and (iv) organic with non-organic rice. Multivariate data analysis was used to explore the sample distribution and its relationship with the e-nose sensors for parameter engineering before ML modeling. Artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms were used to predict the adulteration levels of the rice samples using the e-nose sensors and NIR absorbances readings as inputs. Results showed that both sensing devices could detect rice adulteration at different mixing ratios with high correlation coefficients through direct (e-nose; R = 0.94–0.98) and non-invasive measurement through the packaging (NIR; R = 0.95–0.98). The proposed method uses low-cost, rapid, and portable sensing devices coupled with ML that have shown to be reliable and accurate to increase the efficiency of rice fraud detection through the rice production chain. \textcopyright{} 2022 by the authors.",,,,,,TRUE,10.3390/s22228655,,,https://doi.org/10.3390/s22228655,10.3390__s22228655,,FALSE
101,Rapid Quality Evaluation of Camellia Oleifera Seed Kernel Using a Developed Portable NIR With Optimal Wavelength Selection,"Moisture content is one of the factors measured to evaluate the quality of Camellia oleifera seeds. High quality C. oleifera seeds used for trading must have a low moisture content, specifically not more than 15\% on a dry basis (db). Moisture content analysis requires a prolonged laboratory investigation so that the development of fast and effective determination methods is helpful. The objective of this paper was to develop a low-cost portable NIR reflectance spectrometer collaborating with an android application for the rapid prediction of the moisture content in C. oleifera seeds. To calibrate the prediction model, an effective chemometric algorithm, based on partial least squares regression was established, and models based on wavelength selection algorithms such as backward interval partial least squares (biPLS) and partial least squares coupled with variable importance projection (VIP-PLS) were implemented as an improved version of PLS. Both algorithms (biPLS and VIP-PLS) improved the predictive performance and accuracy of the model. The experimental results showed that the biPLS model with the 1st derivative transformation provided the best prediction for measuring the moisture content of C. oleifera seeds with a coefficient of determination (R2) value of 0.927, standard error of prediction (SEP) of 0.848\%db, bias of -0.067\%db, function slope of 1.005, and ratio of performance deviation (RPD) of 3.696.

102,Readiness Estimation for a Take-Over Request in Automated Driving on an Expressway,"Automated driving is attracting attention as a solution to road traffic problems. At Level3, a take-over request (TOR) is issued to transfer driving operations from the system to a driver when it is unable to continue. In such cases, the driver must be monitored to ensure a proper takeover of the driving operations. This study aims to measure drivers' brain activity before and after the TOR by analyzing time-series signals of brain activity with machine learning algorithms. We developed driving scenarios with a TOR trigger on a rainy expressway at night. We used a portable functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) device to measure cerebral blood oxygenation changes (triangle-HbO) at the frontal pole. We used a long short-term memory (LSTM) network on this data for time-series learning and prediction after multivariate and multilayering modifications to improve accuracy. We conducted driving questionnaires beforehand and used two classification methods to categorize subjects into several groups with similar driving characteristics. Experimental results of a HbO drop revealed that brain activity tended to decrease during automated driving. Moreover, success in obstacle avoidance and mean squared error (MSE) for each driver group demonstrated that the behavior toward an obstacle after the TOR trigger influenced changes in brain activity. \textcopyright{} 2022 ICROS.",,,,,,TRUE,10.23919/ICCAS55662.2022.10003822,,,https://doi.org/10.23919/ICCAS55662.2022.10003822,10.23919__ICCAS55662.2022.10003822,,FALSE

Therefore, this study investigated the relationship between psychological factors and attention towards specific tech-interactions in a smart home system (SHS). The relation between personal psychological traits and eye-tracking metrics is investigated through self-report measures [locus of control (LoC), user experience (UX), behavioral inhibition system (BIS) and behavioral activation system (BAS)] and a wearable and wireless near-infrared illumination based eye-tracking system applied to an Italian sample (n = 19). Participants were asked to activate and interact with five different tech-interaction areas with different levels of complexity (entrance, kitchen, living room, bathroom, and bedroom) in a smart home system (SHS), while their eye-gaze behavior was recorded. Data showed significant differences between a simpler interaction (entrance) and a more complex one (living room), in terms of number of fixation. Moreover, slower time to first fixation in a multifaceted interaction (bathroom), compared to simpler ones (kitchen and living room) was found. Additionally, in two interaction conditions (living room and bathroom), negative correlations were found between external LoC and fixation count, and between BAS reward responsiveness scores and fixation duration. Findings led to the identification of a two-way process, where both the complexity of the tech-interaction and subjects' personality traits are important impacting factors on the user's visual exploration behavior.

Principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) were used to analyze the NIR data. The results obtained in this study showed how the combination of chemometrics and NIR spectroscopy allowed for the classification of egg albumin and yolk samples according to the system of production (cage and free range).
