	abstract     = {Playing Android games on Windows x86 PCs has gained enormous popularity in recent years, and the de facto solution is to use mobile emulators built with the AOVB (Android-x86 On VirtualBox) architecture. When playing heavy 3D Android games with AOVB, however, users often suffer unsatisfactory smoothness due to the considerable overhead of full virtualization. This paper presents DAOW, a game-oriented Android emulator implementing the idea of direct Android emulation, which eliminates the overhead of full virtualization by directly executing Android app binaries on top of x86-based Windows. Based on pragmatic, efficient instruction rewriting and syscall emulation, DAOW offers foreign Android binaries direct access to the domestic PC hardware through Windows kernel interfaces, achieving nearly native hardware performance. Moreover, it leverages graphics and security techniques to enhance user experiences and prevent cheating in gaming. As of late 2018, DAOW has been adopted by over 50 million PC users to run thousands of heavy 3D Android games. Compared with AOVB, DAOW improves the smoothness by 21% on average, decreases the game startup time by 48%, and reduces the memory usage by 22%.},

	abstract     = {In this paper, we for the first time demonstrate how to enable OFDMA in Wi-Fi backscatter for capacity and concurrency enhancement. With our approach, the excitation signal is reflected, modulated and shifted to lie in the frequency band of the OFDM subcarrier by the tag; OFDMA is realized by coordinating tags to convey information to the receiver with orthogonal subcarriers concurrently through backscatter. The crux of the design is to achieve strict synchronization among communication components, which is more challenging than in regular OFDMA systems due to the more prominent hardware diversity and uncertainty for backscattering. We reveal how the subtle asychnronization scenarios particularly for backscattering can incur system offsets, and present a series of novel designs for the excitation signal transmitter, tag, and receiver to address the issue. We build a prototype in 802.11g OFDM framework to validate our design. Experimental results show that our system can achieve 5.2-16Mbps aggregate throughput by allowing 48 tags to transmit concurrently, which is 1.45-5x capacity and 48x concurrency compared with the existing design respectively. We also design an OFDMA tag IC, and the simulation and numerical analysis results show that the tag's power consumption is in tens of Î¼W.},

Such capabilities can be enabled with deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), but it remains difficult to execute large networks on mobile devices. Offloading object detection to the edge or cloud is also very challenging due to the stringent requirements on high detection accuracy and low end-to-end latency. The long latency of existing offloading techniques can significantly reduce the detection accuracy due to changes in the user's view. To address the problem, we design a system that enables high accuracy object detection for commodity AR/MR system running at 60fps. The system employs low latency offloading techniques, decouples the rendering pipeline from the offloading pipeline, and uses a fast object tracking method to maintain detection accuracy. The result shows that the system can improve the detection accuracy by 20.2%-34.8% for the object detection and human keypoint detection tasks, and only requires 2.24ms latency for object tracking on the AR device. Thus, the system leaves more time and computational resources to render virtual elements for the next frame and enables higher quality AR/MR experiences.},

However, DA capabilities have been subverted and abused: malicious apps have used DA to create ransomware or lock users out, while benign apps have used DA to prevent or hinder uninstallation; in certain cases the only remedy is to factory-reset the phone. We call these apps "Deathless Device Administrator" (DDA), i.e., apps that cannot be uninstalled. We provide the first systematic study of Android DA capabilities, DDA apps, DDA-attack resistance across Android versions, and DDA-induced families in malicious apps. To enable scalable studies of questionable DA behavior, we developed DAAX, a static analyzer which exposes potential DA abuse effectively and efficiently. In a corpus of 39,459 apps (20,467 malicious and 18,992 benign) DAAX has found 4,135 DA apps and 691 potential DDA apps. The static analysis results on the 4,135 apps were cross-checked via dynamic analysis on at least 3 phones, confirming 578 true DDAs, including apps currently on Google Play. The study has shown that DAAX is effective (84.8% F-measure) and efficient (analysis typically takes 205 seconds per app).},

	abstract     = {IoT and deep learning based computer vision together create an immense market opportunity, but running deep neural networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained IoT devices remains challenging. Offloading DNN inference to an edge server is a promising solution, but limited wireless bandwidth bottlenecks its end-to-end performance and scalability. While IoT devices can adopt source compression to cope with the limited bandwidth, existing compression algorithms (or codecs) are not designed for DNN (but for human eyes), and thus, suffer from either low compression rates or high DNN inference errors. This paper presents GRACE, a DNN-aware compression algorithm that facilitates the edge inference by significantly saving the network bandwidth consumption without disturbing the inference performance. Given a target DNN, GRACE (i) analyzes DNN's perception model w.r.t both spatial frequencies and colors and (ii) generates an optimized compression strategy for the model -- one-time offline process. Next, GRACE deploys thus-generated compression strategy at IoT devices (or source) to perform online source compression within the existing codec framework, adding no extra overhead. We prototype GRACE on JPEG (the most popular image codec framework), and our evaluation results show that GRACE indeed achieves the superior compression performance over existing strategies for key DNN applications. For semantic segmentation tasks, GRACE reduces a source size by 23% compared to JPEG with similar interference accuracy (0.38% lower than GRACE). Further, GRACE even achieves 7.5% higher inference accuracy than JPEG with a commonly used quality level of 75 does. For classification tasks, GRACE reduces the bandwidth consumption by 90% over JPEG with the same inference accuracy.},

	abstract     = {Deep-learning (DL) is receiving huge attention as enabling techniques for emerging mobile and IoT applications. It is a common practice to conduct DNN model-based inference using cloud services due to their high computation and memory cost. However, such a cloud-offloaded inference raises serious privacy concerns. Malicious external attackers or untrustworthy internal administrators of clouds may leak highly sensitive and private data such as image, voice and textual data. In this paper, we propose Occlumency, a novel cloud-driven solution designed to protect user privacy without compromising the benefit of using powerful cloud resources. Occlumency leverages secure SGX enclave to preserve the confidentiality and the integrity of user data throughout the entire DL inference process. DL inference in SGX enclave, however, impose a severe performance degradation due to limited physical memory space and inefficient page swapping. We designed a suite of novel techniques to accelerate DL inference inside the enclave with a limited memory size and implemented Occlumency based on Caffe. Our experiment with various DNN models shows that Occlumency improves inference speed by 3.6x compared to the baseline DL inference in SGX and achieves a secure DL inference within 72% of latency overhead compared to inference in the native environment.},

	abstract     = {In recent years, convolutional networks have demonstrated unprecedented performance in the image restoration task of super-resolution (SR). SR entails the upscaling of a single low-resolution image in order to meet application-specific image quality demands and plays a key role in mobile devices. To comply with privacy regulations and reduce the overhead of cloud computing, executing SR models locally on-device constitutes a key alternative approach. Nevertheless, the excessive compute and memory requirements of SR workloads pose a challenge in mapping SR networks on resource-constrained mobile platforms. This work presents MobiSR, a novel framework for performing efficient super-resolution on-device. Given a target mobile platform, the proposed framework considers popular model compression techniques and traverses the design space to reach the highest performing trade-off between image quality and processing speed. At run time, a novel scheduler dispatches incoming image patches to the appropriate model-engine pair based on the patch's estimated upscaling difficulty in order to meet the required image quality with minimum processing latency. Quantitative evaluation shows that the proposed framework yields on-device SR designs that achieve an average speedup of 2.13x over highly-optimized parallel difficulty-unaware mappings and 4.79x over highly-optimized single compute engine implementations.},

Existing studies on acoustic communication either use audible frequency band (e.g., &lt;20kHz) to achieve a relatively high throughput or realize inaudibility using near-ultrasonic frequency band (e.g., 18-20kHz) which however can only achieve limited throughput. Leveraging the non-linearity of microphones, voice commands can be demodulated from the ultrasound signals, and further recognized by the speech recognition systems.

QR codes are also gaining importance in the retail sector as a convenient mobile payment method. However, researchers have concerns regarding the security of QR codes, which leave users susceptible to financial loss or private information leakage. In this study, we address this issue by developing a novel QR code (called mQR code), which exploits patterns presenting a specific spatial frequency as a form of camouflage. When the targeted receiver holds a camera in a designated position (e.g., directly in front at a distance of 30 cm from the camouflaged QR code), the original QR code is revealed in form of a Moir\'{e} pattern. From any other position, only the camouflaged QR code can be seen. In experiments, the decryption rate of mQR codes is $&gt; 98%$. The decryption rate for cameras positioned $20degree$ off axis or $&gt; 10cm$ from the designated location drops to $0%$, indicating that any attackers will be unable to steal a usable image.},

We demonstrate that BurstTracker works across Tier-1 cellular providers and across a variety of network conditions. We also present a case study that shows how application developers can use this tool in practice. Surprisingly, with BurstTracker, we find that the LTE downlink may not be the bottleneck for video streaming on several Tier-1 providers, even during peak hours at busy locations. Rather, transparent TCP middleboxes deployed by these providers lead to downlink underutilization, because they force Slow-Start Restart. With a simple workaround, we improve video streaming bitrate on busy LTE links by 35%.},

However, they also pose unprecedented challenges in delivering seamless Internet service for on-board passengers. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale active-passive measurement study of TCP performance over LTE on HSR. Our measurement targets the HSR routes in China operating at above 300 km/h. We performed extensive data collection through both controlled setting and passive monitoring, obtaining 1732.9 GB data collected over 135719 km of trips. Leveraging such a unique dataset, we measure important performance metrics such as TCP goodput, latency, loss rate, as well as key characteristics of TCP flows, application breakdown, and users' behaviors. We further quantitatively study the impact of frequent cellular handover on HSR networking performance, and conduct in-depth examination of the performance of two widely deployed transport-layer protocols: TCP CUBIC and TCP BBR. Our findings reveal the performance of today's commercial HSR networks "in the wild'', as well as identify several performance inefficiencies, which motivate us to design a simple yet effective congestion control algorithm based on BBR to further boost the throughput by up to 36.5%. They together highlight the need to develop dedicated protocol mechanisms that are friendly to extreme mobility.},

In these cases, close physical proximity among devices that have never shared a secret key is sometimes used as a basis of trust; devices in close proximity are deemed trustworthy while more distant devices are viewed as potential adversaries. Because radio waves are invisible, however, a user may believe a wireless device is communicating with a nearby device when in fact the user's device is communicating with a distant adversary. Researchers have previously proposed methods for multi-antenna devices to ascertain physical proximity with other devices, but devices with a single antenna, such as those commonly used in the Internet of Things, cannot take advantage of these techniques.We present theoretical and practical evaluation of a method called SNAP -- SiNgle Antenna Proximity -- that allows a single-antenna Wi-Fi device to quickly determine proximity with another Wi-Fi device. Our proximity detection technique leverages the repeating nature Wi-Fi's preamble and the behavior of a signal in a transmitting antenna's near-field region to detect proximity with high probability; SNAP never falsely declares proximity at ranges longer than 14 cm.},

Systems that use different frequency bands for uplink and downlink communication often need feedback between devices to exchange band specific channel information. The current state-of-the-art approach proposes a way to predict the channel in the downlink based on that of the observed uplink by identifying variables underlying the uplink channel. In this paper we present a solution that greatly reduces the complexity of this task, and is even applicable for single antenna devices. Our approach uses a neural network trained on a standard channel model to generate coarse estimates for the variables underlying the channel. We then use a simple and efficient single antenna optimization framework to get more accurate variable estimates, which can be used for downlink channel prediction. We implement our approach on software defined radios and compare it to the state-of-the-art through experiments and simulations. Results show that our approach reduces the time complexity by at least an order of magnitude (10x), while maintaining similar prediction quality.},

Previous work studied the problem via controlled experiments, while a systematic and in-depth investigation in the wild is still missing. To bridge the gap, we conduct a large-scale measurement campaign on appname, an operational mobile video telephony service. Our measurement logs fine-grained performance metrics over 1 million video call sessions. Our analysis shows that the application-layer video codec and transport-layer protocols remain highly uncoordinated, which represents one major reason for the low QoE. We thus propose name, a machine learning based framework to resolve the issue. Instead of blindly following the transport layer's estimation of network capacity, name reviews historical logs of both layers, and extracts high-level features of codec/network dynamics, based on which it determines the highest bitrates for forthcoming video frames without incurring congestion. To attain the ability, we train name with the aforementioned massive data traces using a custom-designed imitation learning algorithm, which enables name to learn from past experience. We have implemented and incorporated name into appname. Our experiments show that name outperforms state-of-the-art solutions, improving video quality while reducing stalling time by multi-folds under various practical scenarios.},

In in-band-based software-defined wireless networks (IB-SDWNs), the control plane shares wireless channels with the data plane. As the amount of data-plane traffic increases, the interference from the data plane to the control plane becomes stronger, and the switches connected to the SDN controller via the control plane may become out-of-control. In this paper, we propose an interference management scheme that reduces the interference among control and data planes by adjusting the transmission rates of data-plane traffic in switches to ensure reliable connections between the SDN controller and switches. We implemented a prototype of an IB-SDWN and showed that the proposed interference management scheme ensures the reliability of control planes.},

However, in general, the current app development and usage still remain within the single-device paradigm, falling far short of user expectations. We present FLUID, a new multi-device platform that allows users to migrate or replicate individual user interfaces (UIs) of a single app on multiple devices. In addition, FLUID aims to require no extra development effort to support a wide range of legacy apps that follow the trend of using custom-made UIs. To this end, FLUID analyzes which UI states are necessary to correctly render UI objects, deploys only those states on different devices, and supports cross-device function calls transparently. In this demo, we demonstrate several interesting use cases supported by our Android-based FLUID prototype.},

Using solar energy harvesting laws, we develop a model to optimize design and usage of SolarGest. To further improve the robustness of SolarGest under non-deterministic operating conditions, we combine dynamic time warping with Z-score transformation in a signal processing pipeline to pre-process each gesture waveform before it is analyzed for classification. We evaluate SolarGest with both conventional opaque solar cells as well as emerging see-through transparent cells. Our experiments with 6,960 gesture samples for 6 different gestures reveal that even with transparent cells, SolarGest can detect 96% of the gestures while consuming 44% less power compared to light sensor based systems.},

	abstract     = {The automotive industry is increasingly employing software- based solutions to provide value-added features on vehicles, especially with the coming era of electric vehicles and autonomous driving. The ever-increasing cyber components of vehicles (i.e., computation, communication, and control), however, incur new risks of anomalies, as demonstrated by the millions of vehicles recalled by different manufactures. To mitigate these risks, we design B-Diag, a battery-based diagnostics system that guards vehicles against anomalies with a cyber-physical approach, and implement B-Diag as an add-on module of commodity vehicles attached to automotive batteries, thus providing vehicles an additional layer of protection. B-Diag is inspired by the fact that the automotive battery operates in strong dependency with many physical components of the vehicle, which is observable as correlations between battery voltage and the vehicle's corresponding operational parameters, e.g., a faster revolutions-per-minute (RPM) of the engine, in general, leads to a higher battery voltage. B-Diag exploits such physically-induced correlations to diagnose vehicles by cross-validating the vehicle information with battery voltage, based on a set of data-driven norm models constructed online. Such a design of B-Diag is steered by a dataset collected with a prototype system when driving a 2018 Subaru Crosstrek in real-life over 3 months, covering a total mileage of about 1, 400 miles. Besides the Crosstrek, we have also evaluated B-Diag with driving traces of a 2008 Honda Fit, a 2018 Volvo XC60, and a 2017 Volkswagen Passat, showing B-Diag detects vehicle anomalies with &gt;86% (up to 99%) averaged detection rate.},

In these networks, ensuring performance guarantees is hard either due to the lack of infrastructure or its limitations, such as in public safety networks, or due to the challenging communication medium, such as in mmWave networks. Challenged networks face now new constraints with the proliferation of services and applications, increasing number of connected devices, the high computing and control demands, unpredicted human behavior, and only partially-available information. CHANTS'19 aims at bringing researchers together to have a platform for discussing the challenges emerging with new use cases and real-life applications, such as edge computing or autonomous driving, and corresponding innovative approaches in tackling the limitations of the challenged networks. Moreover, this workshop aims at providing another perspective to the broader audience by listing a subset of problems that communication networks, despite the advances on many fronts, still have to tackle. The expected outcomes of CHANTS'19 have the potential to influence industrial thinking about the technologies of next-generation challenged networks.},

	abstract     = {Frequent blood pressure (BP) assessment is key to the diagnosis and treatment of many severe diseases, such as heart failure, kidney failure, hypertension, and hemodialysis. Current "gold-standard'' BP measurement techniques require the complete blockage of blood flow, which causes discomfort and disruption to normal activity when the assessment is done repetitively and frequently. Unfortunately, patients with hypertension or hemodialysis often have to get their BP measured every 15 minutes for a duration of 4-5 hours or more. The discomfort of wearing a cumbersome and limited mobility device affects their normal activities. In this work, we propose a device called eBP to measure BP from inside the user's ear aiming to minimize the measurement's impact on users' normal activities while maximizing its comfort level. eBP has 3 key components: (1) a light-based pulse sensor attached on an inflatable pipe that goes inside the ear, (2) a digital air pump with a fine controller, and (3) a BP estimation algorithm. In contrast to existing devices, eBP introduces a novel technique that eliminates the need to block the blood flow inside the ear, which alleviates the user's discomfort. We prototyped eBP custom hardware and software and evaluated the system through a comparative study on 35 subjects. The study shows that eBP obtains the average error of 1.8 mmHg and -3.1 mmHg and a standard deviation error of 7.2 mmHg and 7.9 mmHg for systolic (high-pressure value) and diastolic (low-pressure value), respectively. These errors are around the acceptable margins regulated by the FDA's AAMI protocol, which allows mean errors of up to 5 mmHg and a standard deviation of up to 8 mmHg.},

Although active attempts have been made to reduce energy consumption, the advent of energy-aware scheduling (EAS) integrated in the recent devices suggests the possibility of a new approach for optimizing energy use by browsers. Our preliminary analysis showed that the existing EAS-enabled system is overly optimized for performance, leading to energy inefficiencies while a web browser is running. In this paper, we analyze the characteristics of web browsers, and investigate the cause of energy inefficiency in EAS-enabled mobile devices. We then propose a system, called WebTune, to improve the energy efficiency of mobile browsers. Exploiting the reinforcement learning technique, WebTune learns the optimal execution speed of the web browser's processes, and adjusts the speed at runtime, thus saving energy and ensuring the quality of service (QoS). WebTune is implemented on the latest Android-based smartphones, and evaluated with Alexa's top 200 websites. The experimental results show that WebTune reduced the device-level energy consumption of the Google Pixel 2 XL and Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus smartphones by 18.7-22.0% and 13.7-16.1%, respectively, without degrading the QoS.},

We present SDC (software-defined cooking), a low-cost closed-loop microwave oven system that aims to heat the food in a software-defined thermal trajectory. SDC achieves this through a novel high-resolution heat sensing and actuation system that uses microwave-safe components to augment existing microwaves. SDC first senses thermal gradient by using arrays of neon lamps that are charged by the Electromagnetic (EM) field a microwave produces. SDC then modifies the EM-field strength to desired levels by accurately moving food on a programmable turntable towards sensed hot and cold spots. To create a more skewed arbitrary thermal pattern, SDC further introduces two types of programmable accessories: microwave shield and susceptor. We design and implement one experimental test-bed by modifying a commercial off-the-shelf microwave oven. Our evaluation shows that SDC can programmatically create temperature deltas at a resolution of 21 degrees with a spatial resolution of 3 cm without accessories and 183 degrees with the help of accessories. We further demonstrate how a SDC-enabled microwave can be enlisted to perform unexpected cooking tasks: cooking meat and fat in bacon discriminatively and heating milk uniformly.},

In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a system, called Strobe, that senses soil moisture and soil EC using RF propagation in existing Wi-Fi bands. Strobe overcomes the key challenge of limited bandwidth availability in the 2.4 GHz unlicensed spectrum using a novel multi-antenna technique. It maps the propagation time and amplitude of Wi-Fi signals received by different antennas to the soil permittivity and EC, which in turn depend on soil moisture and salinity. Our experiments with USRP, WARP, and commodity Wi-Fi cards show that Strobe can accurately estimate soil moisture and EC using Wi-Fi, thereby showing the potential of a future in which a farmer can sense soil in their farm without investing 1000s of dollars in soil sensing equipments.},

	abstract     = {We design and build a protocol called on-off noise power communication (ONPC), which modifies the software in commodity packet radios to allow communication, independent of their standard protocol, at a very slow rate at long range. To achieve this long range, we use the transmitter as an RF power source that can be on or off if it does or does not send a packet, respectively, and a receiver that repeatedly measures the noise and interference power level. We use spread spectrum techniques on top of the basic on/off mechanism to overcome the interference caused by other devices' channel access to provide long ranges at a much lower data rate. We implement the protocol on top of commodity WiFi hardware. We discuss our design and how we overcome key challenges such as non-stationary interference, carrier sensing and hardware timing delays. We test ONPC in several situations to show that it achieves significantly longer range than standard WiFi.},

	abstract     = {Internet of Things (IoT) are densely deployed in smart environments, such as homes, factories and laboratories, where many people have physical access to IoT devices. How to authenticate users operating on these devices is thus an important problem. IoT devices usually lack conventional user interfaces, such as keyboards and mice, which makes traditional authentication methods inapplicable. We present a virtual sensing technique that allows IoT devices to virtually sense user 'petting' (in the form of some very simple touches for about 2 seconds) on the devices. Based on this technique, we build a secure and intuitive authentication method that authenticates device users by comparing the petting operations sensed by devices and those captured by the user wristband. The authentication method is highly secure as physical operations are required, rather than based on proximity. It is also intuitive, adopting very simple authentication operations, e.g., clicking buttons, twisting rotary knobs, and swiping touchscreens. Unlike the state-of-the-art methods, our method does not require any hardware modifications of devices, and thus can be applied to commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) devices. We build prototypes and evaluate them comprehensively, demonstrating their high effectiveness, security, usability, and efficiency.},

However, the complex dependencies between computing and radio resources make vRAN resource control particularly daunting. We present vrAIn, a dynamic resource controller for vRANs based on deep reinforcement learning. First, we use an autoencoder to project high-dimensional context data (traffic and signal quality patterns) into a latent representation. Then, we use a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm based on an actor-critic neural network structure and a classifier to map (encoded) contexts into resource control decisions. We have implemented vrAIn using an open-source LTE stack over different platforms. Our results show that vrAIn successfully derives appropriate compute and radio control actions irrespective of the platform and context: (i) it provides savings in computational capacity of up to 30% over CPU-unaware methods; (ii) it improves the probability of meeting QoS targets by 25% over static allocation policies using similar CPU resources in average; (iii) upon CPU capacity shortage, it improves throughput performance by 25% over state-of-the-art schemes; and (iv) it performs close to optimal policies resulting from an offline oracle. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that thoroughly studies the computational behavior of vRANs, and the first approach to a model-free solution that does not need to assume any particular vRAN platform or system conditions.},

People with PD usually demonstrate deficits in performing basic daily activities, and the relevant annual social cost can reach about $25 billion in the United States. Early detection of PD plays an important role in symptom relief and improvement in the performance of activities in daily life (ADL), which eventually reduces societal and economic burden. However, conventional PD detection methods are inconvenient in daily life (e.g., requiring users to wear sensors). To overcome this challenge, we propose and identify the non-speech body sounds as the new PD biomarker, and utilize the data in smartphone usage to realize the passive PD detection in daily life without interrupting the user. Specifically, we present PDVocal, an end-to-end smartphone-based privacy-preserving system towards early PD detection. PDVocal can passively recognize the PD digital biomarkers in the voice data during daily phone conversation. At the user end, PDVocal filters the audio stream and only extracts the non-speech body sounds (e.g., breathing, clearing throat and swallowing) which contain no privacy-sensitive content. At the cloud end, PDVocal analyzes the body sounds of interest and assesses the health condition using a customized residual network. For the sake of reliability in real-world PD detection, we investigate the method of the performance optimizer including an opportunistic learning knob and a long-term tracking protocol. We evaluate our proposed PDVocal on a collected dataset from 890 participants and real-life conversations from publicly available data sources. Results indicate that non-speech body sounds are a promising digital biomarker for privacy-preserving PD detection in daily life.},

This RF leakage, however, is extremely weak and buried under noise and other transmitted signals that can be 3-5 orders of magnitude larger. Hence, it is missed by today's radios. We design and build Ghostbuster, the first device that can reliably extract this leakage, even when it is buried under ongoing transmissions, in order to detect the hidden presence of eavesdroppers. Ghostbuster does not require any modifications to current transmitters and receivers and can accurately detect the eavesdropper in the presence of ongoing transmissions. Empirical results show that Ghostbuster can detect eavesdroppers with more than 95% accuracy up to 5 meters away.},

The system also exploits characteristics of different eye movement stages and adjusts its sensing and computation accordingly for further energy savings.

	abstract     = {Beamforming is vital to overcome the high attenuation in wireless millimeter-wave networks. It enables nodes to steer their antennas in the direction of communication. To cope with complexity and overhead, the IEEE 802.11ad standard uses a sector codebook with distinct steering directions. In current off-the-shelf devices, we find codebooks with generic pre-defined beam patterns. While this approach is simple and robust, the antenna modules that are typically deployed in such devices are capable of generating much more precise antenna beams. In this paper, we adaptively adjust the sector codebook of IEEE 802.11ad devices to optimize the transmit beam patterns for the current channel. To achieve this, we propose a mechanism to extract full channel state information (CSI) regarding phase and magnitude from coarse signal strength readings on off-the-shelf IEEE 802.11ad devices. Since such devices do not expose the CSI directly, we generate a codebook with phase-shifted probing beams that enables us to obtain the CSI by combining strategically selected magnitude measurements. Using this CSI, transmitters dynamically compute a transmit beam pattern that maximizes the signal strength at the receiver. Thereby, we automatically exploit reflectors in the environment and improve the received signal quality. Our implementation of this mechanism on off-the-shelf devices demonstrates that adaptive codebook optimization achieves a significantly higher throughput of about a factor of two in typical real-world scenarios.},

DeepCache benefits model execution efficiency by exploiting temporal locality in input video streams. It addresses a key challenge raised by mobile vision: the cache must operate under video scene variation, while trading off among cacheability, overhead, and loss in model accuracy. At the input of a model, DeepCache discovers video temporal locality by exploiting the video's internal structure, for which it borrows proven heuristics from video compression; into the model, DeepCache propagates regions of reusable results by exploiting the model's internal structure. Notably, DeepCache eschews applying video heuristics to model internals which are not pixels but high-dimensional, difficult-to-interpret data. Our implementation of DeepCache works with unmodified deep learning models, requires zero developer's manual effort, and is therefore immediately deployable on off-the-shelf mobile devices. Our experiments show that DeepCache saves inference execution time by 18% on average and up to 47%. DeepCache reduces system energy consumption by 20% on average.},

Existing optimizations typically resort to computation offloading or simplified on-device processing. Instead, we observe that the same application is often invoked on multiple devices in close proximity. Moreover, the application instances often processsimilar contextual data that map to thesame outcome. In this paper, we proposecross-device approximate computation reuse, which minimizes redundant computation by harnessing the "equivalence'' between different input values and reusing previously computed outputs with high confidence. We devise adaptive locality sensitive hashing (A-LSH) and homogenized k nearest neighbors (H-kNN). The former achieves scalable and constant lookup, while the latter provides high-quality reuse and tunable accuracy guarantee. We further incorporate approximate reuse as a service, called name, in the computation offloading runtime. Extensive evaluation shows that, when given 95% accuracy target, name consistently harnesses over 90% of reuse opportunities, which translates to reduced computation latency and energy consumption by a factor of 3 to 10.},

The IoT vision for ubiquitous interconnection, in practice, demands multi-hop connectivity for robust and scalable sensor networks, as well as compatibility with such prevailing wireless technologies as WiFi. Today's backscatter solutions however typically follow a single-hop paradigm, i.e., tags do not relay for each other. This paper presents X-Tandem, a multi-hop backscatter system that works with commodity WiFi devices. For the first time, we demonstrate that sensing tags can not only work as relays for each other but also modulate their sensing data into a single backscatter packet, which remains a legit WiFi packet that can be decoded with any commercial WiFi NICs. We discuss the design details of X-Tandem and have built a prototype with FPGAs and off-the-shelf WiFi devices. The prototype demonstrates a two-hop implementation, achieving a throughput up to 200 bps with tag-to-tag distances up to 0.4 m and communication ranges up to 8 m. Compared to single-hop solutions, X-Tandem can improve backscatter throughput by more than 10x in challenging indoor environments with obstacles.},

	abstract     = {Traffic flow prediction is an important research issue to avoid traffic congestion in transportation systems. Traffic congestion avoiding can be achieved by knowing traffic flow and then conducting transportation planning. Achieving traffic flow prediction is challenging as the prediction is affected by many complex factors such as inter-region traffic, vehicles' relations, and sudden events. However, as the mobile data of vehicles has been widely collected by sensor-embedded devices in transportation systems, it is possible to predict the traffic flow by analysing mobile data. This study proposes a deep learning based prediction algorithm, DeepTFP, to collectively predict the traffic flow on each and every traffic road of a city. This algorithm uses three deep residual neural networks to model temporal closeness, period, and trend properties of traffic flow. Each residual neural network consists of a branch of residual convolutional units. DeepTFP aggregates the outputs of the three residual neural networks to optimize the parameters of a time series prediction model. Contrast experiments on mobile time series data from the transportation system of England demonstrate that the proposed DeepTFP outperforms the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture based method in prediction accuracy.},

For ease of deployment of such networks, a wireless backhaul network is highly desired.

In particular, we present a novel network architecture based on steerable links and sufficiently many robust short-range links, to help circumvent the key challenge of outdoor effects in reliable operation of outdoor FSO links. Our architecture is motivated by the fact that, due to the high density of picocells, many short-range links will occur naturally in a picocell backhaul. Moreover, use of steerable FSO links facilitates networks with sufficient redundancy while using only a small number of interfaces per node. We address the key problems that arise in the context of such a backhaul architecture, viz., an FSO link design with desired characteristics, and related network design and management problems. We develop and evaluate a robust 100m FSO link prototype, and simulate the proposed architecture in many metro US cities while show its viability via evaluation of key performance metrics.},

However, this limitation enables a smart attacker to evade localization by simultaneously transmitting from multiple infected devices. Existing localization methods are insufficient or incapable of locating multiple sources when the powers from each source cannot be separated at the receivers. In this paper, we first propose a simple and efficient method that simultaneously locates multiple transmitters using the received power measurements from the selected devices. Second, we build sampling approaches to select sensing devices required for localization. Next, we enhance our sampling to also take into account incentives for participation in crowdsourcing. We experimentally evaluate our localization framework under a variety of settings and find that we are able to localize multiple sources transmitting simultaneously with reasonably high accuracy in a timely manner.},

On top of that, we design, implement and evaluate PassiveVLC, a novel visible light backscatter communication system. PassiveVLC system enables a battery-free tag device to perform passive communication with the illuminating LEDs over the same light carrier and thus offers several favorable features including battery-free, sniff-proof, and biologically friendly for human-centric use cases. Experimental results from our prototyped system show that PassiveVLC is flexible with tag orientation, robust to ambient lighting conditions, and can achieve up to 1 kbps uplink speed. Link budget analysis and two proof-of-concept applications are developed to demonstrate PassiveVLC's efficacy and practicality.},

Virtualizing the mobile network in a flexible way is of paramount importance for a cost-effective realization of this vision. While virtualization has been extensively studied in the case of the mobile core, virtualizing the radio access network (RAN) is still at its infancy. In this paper, we present Orion, a novel RAN slicing system that enables the dynamic on-the-fly virtualization of base stations, the flexible customization of slices to meet their respective service needs and which can be used in an end-to-end network slicing setting. Orion guarantees the functional and performance isolation of slices, while allowing for the efficient use of RAN resources among them. We present a concrete prototype implementation of Orion for LTE, with experimental results, considering alternative RAN slicing approaches, indicating its efficiency and highlighting its isolation capabilities.

In this paper, we propose Pulsar, which uses a compact photodiode sensor, readily fit into a mobile device, to discriminate existing ceiling lights---either fluorescent lights or conventional LEDs---based on their intrinsic optical emission features. To overcome the photodiode's lack of spatial resolution, we design a novel sparse photogrammetry mechanism, which resolves the light source's angle-of-arrival, and triangulates the device's 3D location and even orientation. To facilitate ubiquitous deployment, we further develop a light registration mechanism that automatically registers the ceiling lights' locations as landmarks on a building's floor map. Our experiments demonstrate that Pulsar can reliably achieve decimeter precision in both controlled environment and large-scale buildings.},

The main concern for network operators and vendors is the unfavorable propagation characteristics due to short wavelength and high directionality, which renders the 60 GHz links highly vulnerable to blockage and mobility. However, the advent of multi-band chipsets opens the possibility of leveraging the more robust WiFi technology to assist 60 GHz in order to provide seamless, Gbps connectivity. In this paper, we design and implement MUST, an IEEE 802.11-compliant system that provides seamless, high-speed connectivity over multi-band 60 GHz and WiFi devices. MUST has two key design components: (1) a WiFi-assisted 60 GHz link adaptation algorithm, which can instantaneously predict the best beam and PHY rate setting, with zero probing overhead; and (2) a proactive blockage detection and switching algorithm which can re-direct ongoing user traffic to the robust interface within sub-10 ms latency. Our experiments with off-the-shelf 802.11 hardware show that MUST can achieve 25-60% throughput gain over state-of-the-art solutions, while bringing almost 2 orders of magnitude cross-band switching latency improvement.},

These sensing units require the design of dedicated UASN networking protocols. In this context, we implement the TDA-MAC protocol for data collection in UASN which needs any clock synchronization.

Linear factor is used to optimize the computational process of continuous wavelet transformation. The characteristics of Time-Frequency(T-F) fusion of signals are calculated by constructing T-F array model with modified wavelet factors.

	abstract     = {Various underwater communication applications are proposed to maintain different economic, environmental, and security gains. To support the high quality of service (QoS) requirements of the involved communication tasks, one solution is to rely on multi-mode (i.e., acoustic, optical, magnetic induction (MI), and radio frequency (RF)) communication systems. Such a multi-mode communication system can take advantage of the complementary modesâ features, to obtain QoS requirements per transmission flow. However, challenges including high system cost and coordination between different modes need to be addressed. Therefore, in this paper a Universal Underwater Software Defined Radio (UniSDR) architecture is proposed that realizes joint operation of different modes, in order to deal with the latest use cases demands. Detailed description of the UniSDR architecture is presented. Novelty of the architecture provides flexibility, allowing designer to build a radio that includes any set of modes, which can operate jointly by exchanging data, control and synchronization. A numerical evaluation is conducted to assess the performance of the proposed UniSDR architecture. It clearly shows that the utilization of UniSDR allows to decrease the transmission latency and improve energy efficiency, while maintaining the reliability and robustness.},

	abstract     = {With the advancement and implementation of national ocean strategies, the application of underwater acoustic sensor networks is of great significance. Due to the difficulty of charging or replacing batteries, how to extend the lifetime of underwater sensor networks is one of the key issues that needs to be solved. Typical acoustic routing algorithms mostly use static routing to confirm an energy optimal path and transmit information along this path. Although adopting static routing algorithms cost less energy for transmission, the energy of some specific nodes is quickly consumed, resulting in a short system lifetime. In this paper, we proposed a dynamic ant colony routing algorithm, which updates the routing table after each transmission, so as to make full use of the energy of most nodes. Simultaneously, an optimal path is selected in each transmission based on ant colony algorithm. Therefore, the proposed algorithm achieves both energy balance and minimum energy consumption at the same time, which greatly improves the system lifetime. Comparing with static ant colony routing and dynamic random routing, dynamic ant colony routing has the longest life span.},

Due to the challenging properties of the underwater channel, like the multipath propagation and the Doppler effects, correlation-based methods with fixed sequences only lead to the desired success under good to perfect conditions without signal-, symbol- and timing-reconstruction.

However, when multiple spread spectrum sequences are combined, the envelope is not constant, which will consequently reduce the energy efficiency. Hence, mapping sequences spread spectrum is introduced, which can simultaneously transmit three sequences by transforming three spread spectrum sequences into a constant envelope sequence before transmission. The mapping sequences spread spectrum can effectively reduce the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of the PCSS signal. However, there is still a problem with mapping sequences spread spectrum: when three Gold codes are combined and mapped into a binary sequence, a pseudo correlation peak will appear caused by an interference Gold code when the received signal is correlated with normalized replicas of M possible transmission signals. In this paper, a PCSS underwater acoustic communication system based on the phase differences of correlation peaks method (PDCP-PCSS) is proposed, which can identify and eliminate the pseudo correlation peak by judging the phase differences of the correlation peaks.

In this paper, we explore the capability of machine learning and deep learning methods to learn and accurately model the underwater acoustic channel using real underwater data collected from a water tank with disturbance and from lake Tahoe. Specifically, Deep Neural Network (DNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) are applied to model the underwater acoustic channel. Experimental results show that these models are able to model the underwater acoustic communication channel well and that deep learning models, especially LSTM are better models in terms of mean absolute percentage error.},

In this scheme, the channel quality factor (CQF) is defined as the weighted sum of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and multipath spread to quantitatively evaluate the channel quality. By setting two type of FH modes, i.e., high data rate mode and high reliability mode, the channel quality factor is calculated through the signal demodulation process to facilitate adjustment of frequency hopping mode switching.

This paper presents an SSS image processing framework implemented in an autonomous workflow to provide real-time navigation information. Canny edge detector-based bottom tracking and improved Retinex-based gray level correction are two key algorithms in it. Canny edge detector takes waterfall image as objective, utilizing the information of not only the single ping but also its surrounding pings, which increases the accuracy and stability of sea bottom line extraction. Improved Retinex with Time Variant Gain (TVG) compensation remedies the shortage of attenuation trend correction.

Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technology is a promising approach to mitigate multipath, and has low computational complexity for channel equalization, thus it has been widely used for underwater acoustic communication. The Doppler which leads to carrier frequency offset (CFO) and impulsive noise in underwater acoustic channel will degrade the communication performance significantly. In this paper, we propose a novel method to estimate the impulsive noise and carrier frequency offset. We arrange the null-subcarriers at the edge of OFDM bands. Because of the CFO, there are some null-subcarrier that will be contaminated by adjacent active sub-carriers, but the number of contaminated null-subcarriers is limited, so we regard some null-subcarriers as guard null-subcarriers, which suffer from not only CFO, but also impulsive noise. The remaining null-subcarriers are treated as CFO free null-subcarriers, which only suffer from impulsive noise. We utilize such CFO free null-subcarriers to estimate impulsive noise using compressed sensing method, and then remove the impulsive noise from received signal. Consequently, the CFO is estimated via one-dimensional searching. Compared with traditional separately step-by-step method, our proposed method does not suffer from CFO when estimating the impulsive noise, thus the CFO estimation is improved. Numerical simulation demonstrates that, our proposed method improves the communication performance under the underwater acoustic channel where Doppler and impulsive noise exist.},

	abstract     = {Security in underwater networks is a crucial aspect to maintain correct network operations, but has only partially been investigated so far. Most of the applications of an underwater network are related to military or public safety scenarios, which should exhibit a high robustness to attacks and failures in order to avoid disastrous consequences even with simple Denial-of-Service attacks. The defense mechanisms and countermeasures are usually tailored to specific types of attacks. Albeit this procedure allows to obtain very effective defense mechanisms, it requires the development of different countermeasures for each possible attack. Another possible solution is to use reputation systems to identify the attackers; hence, in this paper we design a trust model able to tackle a wide range of attacks. The idea of the trust model is to observe the behavior of the nodes overhearing the neighborsâ transmissions and use this information in a subjective logic framework to assign a trust metric to each of the neighbors. In addition, in order to take into account the unique characteristics of the underwater acoustic channel, which alternates periods of high packet loss to periods with low errors, we include the channel state in the trust model to avoid to erroneously mark as not trustworthy nodes that correctly forwarded the packets, but could not be overheard due to an unreliable channel.},

	abstract     = {The acoustic field in a shallow sea waveguide has a complex spatial interference structure caused by the sea surface and seabed [1]. This spatial interference will distort the spectrum of the target signal in the propagation process, increasing the difficulty of recognizing underwater acoustic targets. Of course, sufficient target data at different receiving positions can improve the generalization ability of a classifier model. This solution can partly arrest the degradation of the recognition rate, but the high cost and difficulty of acquiring experimental data offset this advantage. Instead, researchers have begun expanding the simulation target data using sound propagation models [2-4]. The target data obtained by this method are reliable. Sufficient simulation data can also compensate the insufficient experimental data. In shallow ocean with low frequency, the normal mode (NM) model can accurately and quickly calculate the acoustic field. Therefore, the NM model is often chosen as the acoustic field calculation model. The NM model represents acoustic field by the superposition of various normal modes. Although the data expansion method based on ocean acoustic fields can improve the recognition rate of targets, which normal modes dominate the recognition rate improvement remains unclear. And classifier based on the deep learning model has high generalization ability, partial acoustic field interference may not affect the recognition rate of targets. When identifying the normal modes that mainly influence the recognition rate, target recognition can be simplified, which has considerable significance.},

This paper proposes a novel approach to maximize network capacity and improve communication fairness by increasing simultaneous communications, achieving time-sharing, and spatial-reuse UWSNs.

Information embedding is a multi-step process that includes time-domain symmetrical division, phase rotation, time reversal, and counterpart exchange. The Information is embedded in the steganography parameters, but not the initial signal itself. So the receiver can get the information by performing the same steganography process on the received signal without knowing any pre-knowledge of the initial signal. In this case, it is able to use different ocean ambient noise as the initial signal for each symbol. Thus, no repeating patterns are observed in the signal; this increases the covertness of this scheme.

It is well known that MIMO and beamforming techniques are among the most effective solutions to address fading challenges. However, not all underwater devices can carry the multiple-transducer system due to cost and size limitations, especially small AUVs and sensors. In this paper, we design and characterize the novel acoustic intelligent surfaces in the underwater environment, which enables the beamforming capability to address the multipath fading problem, without requiring the end-users to equip MIMO components. To the best of our knowledge, although electromagnetic (EM) intelligent surfaces have been intensively investigated for terrestrial communications recently, acoustic intelligent surface has not been explored since it has completely different physical mechanism and hardware structure than that of EM surfaces. Therefore, in this paper, we design a new reconfigurable piezoelectric reflector array that performs as an underwater intelligent surface. Rigorous analytical model is developed to characterize how the designed underwater intelligent surface controls the propagation of acoustic waves in the underwater multipath channel. Based on the new design and model, the underwater intelligent surface-enabled beamforming protocol is provided. Through a hybrid underwater communication simulator based on COMSOL Multiphysics and Bellhop toolbox, we demonstrate the proposed acoustic intelligent surface can effectively form and steer acoustic beams and significantly mitigate the multipath fading in shallow underwater environments.},

Because of their mobility and carrying capacity, AUVs are able to sense the under-ice oceanographic fields, such as temperature, salinity, or velocity field. However, when an AUV observing a rapidly changing temperature field such as a gravity plume, the AUV sampling data distorts by the effect of Doppler smearing and aliasing. Moreover, blind areas of the AUV sampling exist and hinder the further usage of the data. In this paper, we propose the sparse approximation method for reconstructing dynamic temperature fields from AUV sampling data. Using sparse approximation and linear interpolation approaches, the reconstruction of a simulated dynamic temperature field of a gravity plume from simulated AUV sampling data is respectively presented. It shows that the proposed method achieved high-quality overall reconstruction results. With this method, the blind areas of the AUV sampling were complemented correctly with high accuracy.},

Kriging, which is widely used in geostatistics, has been previously used to estimate the communication performance at unknown locations, by performing spatial extrapolation. We compare kriging to cokriging where the latter is a bivariate estimation method. The methodology yields estimates of communication performance at desired locations based on measurements acquired at other locations. Moreover, a variance measure is provided that characterizes the uncertainty of the estimation. We present the structure of the proposed estimation technique and its computational complexity. We evaluate the efficacy of the technique by considering an approximate linear-log model of the communication performance, environmental noise, and a direct comparison of kriging and cokriging results. We provide two sets of simulations in which the proposed multivariate cokriging framework outperforms the univariate kriging in the estimation process.},

	abstract     = {The preamble is the signal to trigger the receiver to change from the standby mode to the working mode. Preamble detection is a very important part for underwater acoustic communications, since if the preamble signal is not detected or the receiver is triggered wrongly by inteferences, the whole communication will fail[6][7].Matched filter (MF) [5] is widely used for sonar detection. It correlates the transmitted with received waveform to determine whether and when a target appears. The MF has a very simple formulation, and is optimal in additive white noise in probing a stationary target since it gives the highest output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) among all FIR filters in White Gaussian Noise (WGN). The Page test (PT)[1] is used to improve the detection performance in the nonstationary underwater channel with the slowly changing noise level and multiple echoes for active sonar systems. Besides, the normalized matched filter (NMF)[3] relies on the matching of the signal shapes for detection, minimizes the influence of unknown SNR which is more practical than the MF in complicated underwater environments. Other anti-interference detectors for preamble in underwater multipath channel are proposed [7][4][9] to further improve the detection.All the above traditional detectors are based on assumption that the Nyquist frequency is absolutely met. However, the underwater systems usually need to be low power-consuming, especially in standby mode. And undersampling processing can lower the power, cost and even storage for preamble in standby mode. Hence undersampling preamble detection calls for studying for underwater acoustic modems. Undersampling makes signal aliasing and lose much feature, hence it leads traditional detection failure.Doppler-insensitive waveforms[10] such as hyperbolic frequency modulation (HFM) or linear frequency modulation (LFM) are often used as the probing waveforms for target detection in radar and sonar applications and preambles in communications. Undersampling processing can seriously weaken the detection of these wideband signals.In this work, we propose a new detector named Sparse Learning via Iterative Minimization(SLIM)-detector. SLIM is proposed for sonar location in [8]. It can collect echoes from Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO). In our work we use this principle to collect and strengthen energy from underwater multipath channel. With SLIM-detector, energy of preamble is strengthened after iterations in SLIM, then collected. Even if the undersampling makes the signal aliasing, we can still separate preamble from different interferences and noise.SLIM-detector works different from SLIM. The initialization part of SLIM-detector is similar to NMF which presents a rough model for detection. The iterative part of SLIM-detector is the main part of SLIM estimator. In this part, the strongest paths become stronger after each iteration and the weak paths become weaker. This can also help us distinguish real paths of preamble signals from false alarms under aliasing caused by undersampling. One of the challenges to put this detector into practical use is that the original assumption for SLIM is under WGN. Therefore interferences can bring outliers which can lead the detection into failure. As we know, normalization can lower the false matching for MF. Here we add another normalization step after the iterations to further lower the false alarms of interferences. Another challenge to make the detector practical is that a reasonable signal template is crucial. The iterations make the matching very sensitive. This is a benefit if the template is good enough, but can also be a weakness when the template is too rough. A good template should try to cover all the possible delays and Doppler-shifts of preamble signals. However this will lead to a large dimensional signal template and low efficiency. Here also comes to why we choose HFMs as our preamble signals: it is Doppler-insensitive, and the Doppler-shift in it can be converted into a time-delay. Hence we only need to consider the coverage of the possible delay in signal template. Besides, the threshold is also difficult to obtained in practice. The normalization step helps us to limit it into a small range. Empiric value can be recommended from simulations and experiments.The experimental results show the performance of SLIM-detector under undersampling condition. In the experimental data, the HFM signal with 5kHz bandwidth comes from the test in Qiandao Lake, Zhejiang, China, in 2017, full of multipath. The impulsive interference data sets were collected from the sea experiment conducted in May 2013, in the South China Sea, near Kaohsiung City, Taiwan.Other data sets of interferences are collected from the Mobile Acoustic Communication Experiment (MACE10), which was held in June 2010 off the coast of Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts. After downsampling, the sampling frequency of received preamble becomes 5kHz. It is much lower than Nyquist frequency. SNR is --6 dB. In Figure 1, SLIM-detector is robust against undersampling, while other conventional detectors totally fail in some interferences due to the aliasing effect. Results show SLIM-detector can be used as an efficient detector for the undersampling preamble signal.},

	abstract     = {Underwater acoustic communications with multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) is critically important because it supports the coordinated team mission in the ocean. AUVs, as compact mobile platforms, have limited computing resources and physical space, thus impeding the adoption of spectrally-efficient acoustic communication strategies including multi-antennas transmissions. For example, only a single transmitter is installed on an AUV. Allocation of limited communication resources is also a critical issue when multiple vehicles are involved in the mission. Here, we propose a virtual multiple-input/multiple-output (MIMO) strategy for communications with multiple AUVs. The virtual MIMO strategy selects the transmitters from a subset of AUVs to form a virtual transmit array. The objective is to increase spectral efficiency for the uplink, referring to the transmission connection from the AUVs to moored communication base stations. A user selection algorithm is used to determine the active AUV subset for data transmissions, to ensure the fairness in access to the time slots. Adaptive modulation is combined to improve the throughput further. The user selection and modulation choice are decided by predicted data rates derived from the communication range rather than the channel state information, thus avoiding the high overhead. The performance of the underwater virtual MIMO scheme has been examined in computer simulations, where the vehicle-specific mission tracks, simulated acoustic communication channels from BELLHOP, and time reversal communication receivers were used. The simulation results showed that the proposed algorithm achieved a high overall throughput in a scenario with five AUVs. Further, the assignment fairness of time slots was considered while maximizing the overall throughput.},

However, characteristics such as low data rate, long propagation delay, energy-constraint, mobility and sparsity of underwater communications remain as major challenges to the potential benefits that IoUT can bring to data availability and data sciences. This paper aims to further explore how the Named Data Networking (NDN), a future Internet architecture, addresses the challenges of IoUT and can be adapted to potentially provide a more secure, simplified, and efficient implementation of IoUT. The IoUT network and application semantics are aligned with the data-centric communication model of NDN, which enables operators to deploy and configure networks more easily, and developers to focus more on "things" and data. The paper starts from introducing new challenges in IoUT and then illustrating in detail with simple examples to show how to employ NDN architecture to IoUT and how to enable additional functionalities required by IoUT.},

The three key exchange solutions are the Fully Hashed Menezes-Qu-Vanstone, the Hashed One-pass Menezes-Qu-Vanstone (both based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography) and Diffie-Hellman. Certificate distribution is performed via the Elliptic Curve Qu-Vanstone protocol (implicit) and by X.509 certificates (explicit). Combinations of the selected protocols are considered to secure multipath-based communications in UASNs of different size. Investigated metrics concern the energy consumed and the time required to complete the exchange of keys between two nodes. Our results show that implicit certificates-based solutions obtain application-dependent tradeoffs between security and energy efficiency and a level of security comparable to that of the standard, terrestrial combination of Diffie-Hellman with the X.509 explicit certificates.},

In this paper, we propose a method making full use of the ambiguity plane of MFP to track a point target in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region by employing multiple hypothesis tracking (MHT). The simulation results show that the approach proposed in this paper outperforms the traditional MFP in the condition of low SNR.},

This posed a great challenge for situation awareness applications where the data for the entire area is needed. In this paper, a joint sensor selection and data recovery scheme is proposed to address the challenge. Specifically, a small portion of sensors are selected using the independent thinning principle from Stochastic Geometry to transmit their data to the surface station. Then Total Variation Inpainting is applied to recover the entire data of the whole area from the available data. The proposed scheme offers a promising solution in situations where only small amount of data could be captured due to the difficult underwater environment. It also saves time because computing at the surface station for data reconstruction takes much less time comparing to data collection. The simulation results using both synthetic data and real data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

This way, new lower bound expressions on channel capacity are derived when additional constraints are imposed on the channel input. Based on the analysis, it is seen that the capacity of the saline water channel is decreased at a fixed signal to noise ratio compared to the tap water channel. The attenuation of optical signal further increases as the noises surge, leading to degradation in the systemâs capacity.},

How to accurately quantify and effectively achieve the freshness of information stored in ICSNs pose a new challenge. We propose an algorithmic framework, referred to as MIF: maximization of information freshness, to maximize the freshness of data packets stored in ICSNs while incurring a minimum amount of energy cost in this process. We first formulate an integer linear programming (ILP) problem to solve MIF optimally. We then propose a more time-efficient greedy algorithm.

Receivers can be attached or integrated into autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) allowing wide spatial coverage for telemetry networks while collecting environmental data. The integration of calculated sound speeds and received pings gives an estimation of variation in detection efficiency due to changes in environmental conditions, allowing underwater network users to better quantify the range of reliable detection. Data from a Slocum glider deployed over an array of 16 moored telemetry instruments on the inner shelf off Georgia in 2019 and 2020 indicate that detection efficiency and range vary seasonally. Beam density analysis using ray tracing is proposed as a novel approach that quantifies probability of detection as a function of range, modeling sound speed variability and propagation using co-located temperature and salinity measurements. This approach is validated through comparison of modeled to observed distributions, which suggests that beam density analysis is a promising method to remotely estimate detection efficiency in real time. This real time capability can be leveraged through adaptive sampling in the design and implementation of robotic acoustic telemetry networks.},

This paper presents field experiments performed in Fuxian Lake, Daya Bay and the Yellow Sea, respectively, to evaluate the achievable network performance. In the above tests, the underwater nodes were deployed as string topologies and accessed to the acoustic channel by Pipelining MAC (PMAC). Nodes deployed three hops away were allowed to transmit simultaneously, by eliminating chances of collisions and parallelizing transmissions. These experiments verify the effectiveness of our deployment schedules in terms of network performance.

	abstract     = {Acoustic propagation through water suffers from attenuation that increases with both signal frequency and transmission range, with time-varying long propagation delays. The power spectral density of underwater ambient noise also changes with frequency. As a result, the usable channel bandwidth is heavily constrained and Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol design for Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks (UASNs) is challenging. Striking a balance between channel utilisation and network end-to-end delay is particularly difficult. The Combined Free/Demand Assignment Multiple Access (CFDAMA) protocol has been shown to effectively minimise end-to-end delay and maximise channel utilisation, but existing approaches are reliant on synchronisation which is hard to achieve underwater. This paper introduces a novel robust MAC protocol, based on CFDAMA, exclusively designed for UASNs and called CFDAMA-NoClock. It is capable of providing an adaptive MAC solution without the need for synchronisation amongst independent node clocks. The protocol demonstrates a high level of practicality and simplicity. Both analytical models and comprehensive event-driven simulation of several underwater scenarios show that CFDAMA-NoClock can offer excellent delay/utilisation performance under two distinct traffic types and with various network parameters selected based on practical UASN technologies.},

In this paper, we put forth a new deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm called delayed-reward deep Q-network (DR-DQN) to solve this problem. In particular, we propose a new multiple access protocol, referred to as delayed-reward DRL multiple access (DR-DLMA). The system objective is to find an optimal channel access strategy that maximizes the network throughput, by making full use of the available time-slots resulted from the long propagation delay or not used by other nodes in the network. We also give the upper bound on the network throughput in various cases as our benchmark, and show that the DR-DLMA can achieve a near-optimal performance with all the different propagation delays. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of the proposed protocol in heterogeneous and homogeneous networks, respectively. When coexisting with one FW-ALOHA node, the maximum gap between the network throughput achieved by the DR-DLMA and the optimal solution is within 10%. In homogeneous networks, we demonstrate that DR-DLMA outperforms traditional MAC protocols for UWANs (e.g., slotted FAMA and DOTS) in terms of the network throughput. Particularly, in the four-node network with a maximum propagation delay of 4, DR-DLMA yields 470% and 190% higher throughput on average than slotted FAMA and DOTS, respectively.},

Because of the Snell effect caused by non-uniform distribution of sound speed, the signal propagation path is curved, which would lead to errors when traditional linear propagation localization models are used. Sound speed profiles (SSPs) can be used to correct the signal trajectory error according to the ray theory, so as to improve the localization accuracy. To simplify the expression of original SSPs and reduce the computational complexity of ray tracing while guaranteeing the accuracy, we propose a stratified linear SSP simplification method with a distance-minimization-based equal-interval control points searching (DM-EICPS) algorithm. Simulation results show that, compared with other curve approximation algorithms, the DM-EICPS algorithm not only generates simplified SSPs rapidly, but also achieves good SSP approximation accuracy. Moreover, the corrected localization accuracy with simplified SSPs is an order of magnitude higher than the linear propagation model, and the time overhead of ray tracing with simplified SSPs is obviously reduced compared to original SSPs.},

One of the most malicious attacks in USNs is the sinkhole attack, where an adversary first captures a sensor node and then lures the surrounding network traffic by using false routing information. Later, the captured node can forward the captured network traffic to the intruder or drop the packets. Sinkhole attacks negatively affect the lifetime, end-to-end latency, and energy-efficiency of USNs since lured nodes spend energy in an unbalanced manner and the forwarding process introduces additional latency. In this work, we investigate the lifetime, end-to-end latency, and energy consumption performances of USNs under sinkhole attacks within an integer programming (IP) model which maximizes USNs lifetime. Our results show that if half of the nodes in the network are lured by a sinkhole node, the network lifetime decreases at a minimum of 71%; the end-to-end latency and energy consumption are increased at least by 89% and 77% as compared to the performance metrics which are obtained in the case of no sinkhole attacks.},

Implementation and testing experiments have been performed with the SUNSET SDCS framework and its SecFUN extension using as hardware two submerged acoustic modems. Results show that our approach imposes a low computational burden to the underwater node, which implies low local energy consumption.

Magnetic induction (MI) communication is a promising candidate thanks to several unique features such as small transmission delay, constant channel behavior and high bandwidth. WUSNs using MI-assisted acoustic distributed beamforming (MADB) can achieve better connectivity performance by enable the transmission range of nodes. In WUSNs-MADB, due to the underwater channel characteristics and the heterogeneous network architecture, the connectivity analysis is much more complicated than that of WUSNs.

Here we analyze the characteristics of the self-interference based on the fieldwork, where self-interference measurements have been collected for multiple acoustic frequencies ranging from 20 to 180 kHz. The interference cancellation (IC) gain, as the performance metric of the digital self-interference suppression, is found to decrease when the acoustic carrier frequency increases. We propose to use the channel variation ratio (CVR) to characterize channel variability.

Two acoustic hydrophones are used underwater; one to transmit a single tone signal in the direction of a swimmer and the other to receive the reflected waveform from the swimmer's body. We apply joint time-frequency analysis on the received acoustic signal to extract the micro-Doppler signatures present in the spectrogram.

To classify the acoustic micro-Doppler signatures, we explore a deep convolution neural network (DCNN) algorithm.

We show that using the spectrogram images the DCNN algorithm can classify different swimming styles performed on the surface of the water with fairly high accuracy.

	abstract     = {Underwater vehicles are utilized in various applications including underwater data-collection missions. The tethered connection constrains the mission both in distance traveled and number of vehicles that can run in the same area, while the addition of acoustic communications onto the vehicles grants them several functionalities. However, due to the low bandwidth of the underwater acoustic channel---which leads to low data rates---and the time overhead imposed by both the channel propagation delay and the processing delay by the acoustic modems, efficient protocols are required. In this paper, an implicit data-compression and transmission protocol is proposed to carry out environmental monitoring missions such as adaptive sampling of physical and chemical parameters in the water. In a semi-autonomous manner between the vehicle and the control center, both sides keep silent in data transmission as long as they can estimate and predict the actions of the other side, unless environmental data and/or kinematic data are found to be unpredictable. Our design puts the human in the loop to send high-level control commands. Experiments were conducted using an autonomous vehicle with WHOI micro-modems in the Raritan River, Somerset, Carnegie Lake in Princeton, and in the Marine Park in Red Bank, all in New Jersey.},

	abstract     = {Magnetic induction (MI) has shown a great potential for underwater communications due to its immunity to acoustic noise and low latency. However, the transmission distance of MI is limited since the magnetic field attenuates very fast in the near field. In this work, a magneto inductive antenna design is studied to achieve two modes of operation: 1) a static quasi omni-directional magnetic coupling; 2) a dynamic rotation of magnetic coupling. A design procedure is described to define the strength of the magnetic field, bandwidth (BW) and the path loss (PL) of the underwater communication link. Both modes are simulated and the corresponding antenna configurations are described. The proposed antenna has three coils separated between each other by 120 degrees. The coils have a radius of 5 cm and a length of 8 cm. The simulation results illustrate how this design can provide an omni-directional magnetic coupling and a more directional performance in the rotation mode. In the rotation mode, simulations also confirmed that the magnetic field can be controllable by changing the phases of input currents.},

	abstract     = {Underwater acoustic communications (UAC) is the main technical means for underwater cableless transmission. Due to the serious multi-path, time-varying and Doppler effects of underwater acoustic channel (UWAC), the received signals are overlapped and distorted, which brings serious inter symbol interference (ISI). On the other hand, the limited bandwidth and the low signal-to-noise ratio in UWAC seriously limit the transmission rate. Faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling can break the restriction of Nyquist criterion and achieve higher transmission rate, but at the cost of introducing inherent ISI. Therefore, how to eliminate the serious ISI at the receiving end of UAC-FTN system with low complexity has become the main problem that restricts the application of FTN technology in UAC. To solve this problem, in the paper, a turbo receiver with tridirectional channel estimation scheme and low-complexity soft information interaction is proposed for the UAC-FTN system. The channel impulse response during one data block is obtained by estimating the channel parameters of the front, back and middle parts of this block. Lake experiment results verify that the new algorithm has better BER performance and lower complexity compared to some recently proposed algorithms in the literature.},

	abstract     = {This paper reports on a cross-domain communication system for marine robots based on code-division multiple access (CDMA). The underwater communications channel is a difficult transmission medium due to its link quality variability which depends on location and the application. It also depends on environmental parameters which can vary temporally from hours to days to months to season. Understanding the channel characteristics for data transmission is essential to the development and evaluation of existing or new MAC and Routing Level protocols which better utilize the limited resources within this unpredictable channel. CDMA is the most promising physical layer and multiple access technique for underwater acoustic sensor networks because it: i) is robust to frequency selective fading, ii) compensates for multi-path effects at the receiver, and iii) allows receivers to distinguish among signals simultaneously transmitted by multiple devices. For these reasons, CDMA increases channel re-use and reduces packet retransmissions, which results in decreased energy consumption and increased network throughput. Development of a framework for autonomous co-ordination and networking of marine robot teams from extended ranges to transmit images/information from underwater to above water is proposed using CDMA which is a complete stack of communications protocol from the physical to the application layer for marine robots that spans multiple domains, i.e. under, on and above water. Simulation of the proposed network was performed using network simulator-3 (NS-3). The proposed protocol edge CDMA properties provide multiple access to the limited underwater bandwidth whereas previous reported work only considered CDMA for the physical layer. Simulations show the proposed protocol outperforms existing underwater acoustic network protocols.},

In this paper, an efficient FTN transceiver is proposed for underwater acoustic (UWA) communications. At the transmitter, the FTN signaling is implemented via the serial concatenation of a sample-rate-convertor (SRC) based on the well-known Farrow filter and the Nyquist pulse shaping. Compare with the conventional FTN signaling, it facilitates the convolution operation and thus achieves the efficient FTN signaling. On the receiver side, the direct-adaptive turbo equalization is employed to combat the hybrid inter-symbol interference (ISI) of the artificial ISI introduced by FTN signaling and the UWA channel-ISI. Wherein the improved proportionate normalized least mean squares (IPNLMS)-based direct-adaptive equalizer (DAE) with the data reuse (DR) aid is adopted as the soft equalizer. As for the channel coding, an irregular convolutional code (IrCC) is designed by matching the extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) curve of the DR-IPNLMS-DAE, leading to a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) threshold of the turbo iteration. Underwater experimental results verify the advantage of the FTN transmission over the higherorder modulation in terms of improving the spectral efficiency, and they show the proposed FTN transceiver scheme has the better detection performance than the traditional turbo equalization.},

By exploiting the cross-correlation of mulipath arrivals, an efficient type of channel tracking for underwater acoustic channel is proposed by decomposing the cross-correlation into the channel principal components with low rank and the corresponding channel subspace. To track the channel, the channel principal components are modeled as an autoregressive (AR) process, and a Kalman filter tracks the channel components based on this AR model. The channel subspace is also tracked by recursive algorithms. However, these multi-procedure algorithms leave many undecided parameters which can affect the performance substantially. And the mismatch of the priori model is inevitable for underwater acoustic channels. In this paper, we present a training-based adaptive channel tracking algorithm. With the help of a short prior sequence of data, the parameters for the trackers are obtained through training. And an adaptive Kalman filter is used to correct the mismatch of the model which is also training-based. Performance of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated with real sea data. For the real sea data analyzed, the channel tracking accuracy is improved both in calm sea and rough sea.},

This paper presents a survey of past and recent work on this topic, covering the development both of the communication technologies and of the networking schemes and protocols for multimodal networks.

	abstract     = {Underwater acoustic communications experiments often involve custom implementations of schemes and protocols for the physical and data link layers. However, most commercial modems focus on providing reliable or optimized communication links, rather than on allowing low-level reconfiguration or reprogramming of modulation and coding schemes. As a result, the physical layer is typically provided as a closed, non-reprogrammable black box, accessible by the user only through a specific interface. While software-defined modems would be the ultimate solution to overcome this issue, having access to the symbols transmitted by the modems using a proprietary modulation format already opens up a number of research opportunities, e.g., aimed at the cross-layer design and optimization of channel coding schemes and communication protocols.In this paper, we take the latter approach. We consider the commercial EvoLogics modem, driven by a custom firmware version that bypasses the channel coding methods applied by the modem, and allows the user to set the transmit bit rate to any desired value within a given set. This makes it possible to evaluate different coding schemes in the presence of different bit rates. Our results show that the custom firmware offers sufficient flexibility to test different configurations of the coding schemes and bit rates, by providing direct access both to correctly decoded and to corrupted symbols, which can be separated at the receiver for further processing. In addition, we show that the DESERT Underwater framework can also leverage the same flexibility by employing low-level physical layer access in more complex networking experiments.},

In this paper, we propose iSonar, the first system implementing reliable software-defined acoustic networking between water-proof smartphones. Specifically, iSonar transforms off-the-shelf smartphones into ultrasonic software "radios" that implement an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing-based communication system to exchange data under water. To this end, iSonar sends and receives information through the AUX interface and by implementing a lightweight network stack entirely in software. We have implemented a fully-functional hardware/software prototype of iSonar on Android smartphones and off-the-shelf electronic equipment, and extensively evaluated its performance through several experiments in a tank testbed. Results show that iSonar is able to achieve packet error rate (PER) of 10-3, which is significant considering the low audio sampling rate and the strong multipath effect induced by the water tank environment.},

Although the deployment of multi-channel increases throughput significantly, it also opens up the possibility of collision occurrence due to the hidden terminal problem. In particular, the "Triple Hidden Terminal (THT)" problems, a phenomenon characterized by collision occurrence due to multi-hop, multi-channel communication with long propagation delay, persists more dominantly in UWSN. Existing MAC protocols try to mitigate the adverse effect of THT without utilizing the information of propagation delay that may be exploited to improve the performance of UWSN significantly. The current work proposes a Cooperative Underwater Multi-Channel MAC protocol with Channel Allocation Matrix (CUMAC-CAM). A new Channel Allocation Matrix (CAM) has been introduced for estimating propagation delay to ensure enhanced channel utilization. In this scheme, each node maintains a delay mapping database, based on which senders and receivers perform a scheduling algorithm before initiating any transmission. This mapping helps a node to predict whether it's upcoming packet transmission will collide with other nodes' transmission or not. In brief, the objective is to ensure successful transmission by mitigating triple hidden terminal problems in multi-channel underwater sensor networks as well as to enhance the channel utilization with the benefit of delay mapping and channel allocation assessment. Simulation results, carried out for performance analysis, show that the proposed MAC protocol is more efficient in terms of network throughput, energy consumption, end to end delay and packet delivery ratio compared to the contemporary CUMAC protocol.},

	abstract     = {Classic vision-based navigation solutions, which are utilized in algorithms such as Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), usually fail to work underwater when the water is murky and the quality of the recorded images is low. That is because most SLAM algorithms are feature-based techniques and often it is impossible to extract the matched features from blurry underwater images. To get more useful features, image processing techniques can be used to dehaze the images before they are used in a navigation/localization algorithm. There are many well-developed methods for image restoration, but the degree of enhancement and the resource cost of the methods are different. In this paper, we propose a new visual SLAM, specifically-designed for the underwater environment, using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to enhance the quality of underwater images with underwater image quality evaluation metrics. This procedure increases the efficiency of SLAM and gets a better navigation and localization accuracy. We evaluate the proposed GANs-SLAM combination by using different images with various levels of turbidity in the water. Experiments were conducted and the data was extracted from the Carnegie Lake in Princeton, and the Raritan river both in New Jersey, USA.},

Several simulation experiments verify that iterative interchannel interference cancelation can, in principle, effectively remove such interference, even for channels with very short coherence times.A low-complexity signal processing structure for effective communications over doubly-spread channels is presented and its performance is quantified in a series of experiements and related to the theoretically obtainable maximum performance, providing a well-rooted baseline benchmark for other methods, or the future inclusion of channel estimation and tracking algorithms.},

In this paper, we propose a Bidirectional Multi-flow MAC protocol (BMF-MAC) for UW-ASN, to efficiently handle multi-hop multi-flow traffic load patterns such a way that multiple streams of data transmissions concurrently proceed while adapting with varying traffic condition. BMF-MAC supports constitution of multi-hop flows by considering all pending packets in routing layer buffer and all flow setups requests from neighbors when setting up a flow, contrary to other underwater MAC protocols. The proposed MAC introduces a data transmission technique using the bidirectional multi-flow packet method for sending multiple data packets of the same flow in the reverse direction and thus improve channel utilization. The protocol is aimed to schedule more data transmission over multiple multi-hop flows, thus permitting rapid distribution of data and reduction of latency. Results show that BMF-MAC protocol outperforms existing CMRT protocol in terms of network throughput and packet delivery latency.},

The detection performance analysis system, which consists of the sound source and propagation loss level, the interfering noise level, the marine reverberation average strength level, and the target echo sound level, was established in this study. Aiming at a specified area, this study realizes a performance analysis based on the detection probabilities of targets in different locations. In terms of detection performance, the bistatic sonar system especially faces considerable direct wave interference. Therefore, a method for restraining direct wave interference based on zero constraint beam-forming was developed. This method can mitigate the both narrow-band and broadband direct wave interference problems. Another method based on space timeadaptive processing was also developed. This method can also solve direct wave interference problem. Using the above performance analysis system, considering the influence of strong direct wave interference, the detection range can increase 35% by using the zero constraint beam-forming method, thus further enhancing the detection performance.},

Due to the long propagation delay and the high packet loss rate of the under water acoustic communication links, achieving high end-to-end throughput in multi-hop underwater acoustic networks is challenging. This paper proposes a practical transport-network layer scheme to achieve high throughput and low latency data transmission in multi-hop underwater networks using BATS codes, which are a class of efficient linear network coding scheme with a matrix generalization of fountain codes as the outer code, and batch-based linear network coding as the inner code.},

Wake-up mechanisms for UAC terminals play an important role in reducing the power consumption and extending the battery life. Compared with terrestrial wireless counterparts, the wake-up receivers for UAC terminals are challenged by the severe underwater acoustic channels, which are characterized by doubly-selective fading and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Furthermore, the wake-up receiver is with weak processing ability. The paper proposes a wake-up mechanism named as channel-adaptive detection and joint decision (ChAD-JD). ChAD-JD uses linear frequency modulation (LFM) as wake-up signals. In order to increase the detection probability and reduce the probability of false alarm, the novel approach applies channel-adaptive detection and joint decision methods, respectively. Simulation and experimental results show that ChAD-JD is more reliable and effective compared with traditional LFM-based detection methods with a fixed threshold.},

The strategy of concurrent transmission improves channel utilization by reducing the number of handshakes. Scheduling transmission avoids packet collisions.

Using data collected during an experiment in the South China Sea, we study seafloor reflection effects on sound propagation in a range dependent environment. The experiment phenomenon is different from the convergence phenomenon in the deep sound channel, also referred to as the SOFAR channel. We observe that the spatial variation of bathymetry contributes to the formation of the seafloor reflection convergence zone in advance, and the sound intensity in some areas of the shadow zone is significantly increased. Due to seafloor reflection, there are two seafloor reflection convergence zone within 60 km of the propagation track, in which the gains of the acoustic energy can exceed 10 dB. High sound intensity areas are also observed in the shadow zone near 11 km and 51 km at some depths. In addition, the gain of the second convergence zone is higher than that of the first convergence zone when the receiving depth is the same as the source depth. In the first convergence zone, as the receiving depth increases, the arrival structure tends to become complicated, and the multipath effect becomes more obvious. Numerical analysis based on the parabolic equation and ray theory is carried out to explain the physical mechanism of the seafloor reflection convergence zone. The study result is meaningful for the performance analysis of sonar in complex deep-water environments.*},

Virtual data samples generated from a kriging method are inserted into the blank areas. We show that by using the virtual samples along with real samples, the acoustic intensity field can be reconstructed with higher accuracy when coherent spatial patterns exist. Corresponding algorithms are developed for both unweighted and weighted KCS methods. By distinguishing the virtual samples from real samples through weighting, the reconstruction results can be further improved. Simulation results show that both algorithms can improve the reconstruction results according to the PSNR and SSIM metrics.

In this paper, we build a hydroacoustic baseband defferentially encoded OFDM system and propose an effective approach to mitigate the Doppler effect for the system. After utilizing the Chirp-Z transform(CZT) to estimate a coarse common value of large scale Doppler factor a and null subcarriers for the estimation of residual Doppler am for each OFDM symbol, we use the method of polyphase filter resampling to compensate them. We also correct the phase rotation effect caused by timing sampling offset according to the residual Doppler estimation result.

This scheme improves the performance of Alamouti space-time coded OFDM systems in underwater acoustic communication in the following aspects: First, FBMC modulation is introduced to reduce out-of-band leakage through a re-designed window. Besides, FBMC modulation can also increase spectral efficiency because it does not need extra cyclic prefix. Second, the subband cutting method provides more stable bit error performance, benefited from the nonoverlapping feature of channel effect. According to our simulation results for the Alamouti space-time coded OFDM system and subband cutting based MIMO-FBMC system, the latter can achieve better performance, especially in long time-delay underwater acoustic channels.},

In this paper, a rate adaptive resource allocation algorithm is investigated in which subcarrier and power allocation are carried out sequentially to reduce the process' computational complexity. During the subcarrier allocation, an algorithm based on a rate constrained by what satisfies the minimum rate request is proposed. Then by combining subcarrier allocation and channel state information, an approximate suboptimal power algorithm is proposed. Compared with the root-finding and linear methods, the proposed algorithm has a higher sum rate and relatively lower computational complexity under poor underwater acoustic communication (UAC).},

Differential coding and decoding inhibit the influence of fast-carrier phase fluctuation effectively, and time-reversal mirror technology controls multipath propagation. A tracking/updating adaptive channel estimation algorithm used in this system estimates the real-time time-varying acoustic channel and save the effective estimation channel as the time-reversal mirror processing channel to ensure the reliability of processing.

	abstract     = {Sound speed profiles (SSPs) have a great impact on the accuracy of underwater localization and sonar ranging. In traditional SSP inversion, the sound intensity distribution used in normal mode theory-based matching field processing (MFP) or the multipath signal propagation time adopted in ray theory-based MFP is susceptible to boundary parameter mismatch issues, which reduces the inversion accuracy. Moreover, heuristic algorithms introduced in the MFP require many individuals and iterations to search for the optimal feature representation coefficients after the empirical orthogonal function (EOF) decomposition, which causes extra computational time. In this paper, we propose a two-way interactive signal propagation time measurement method based on an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) and a horizontal linear array (HLA), and we apply the propagation time of direct arrival signals for shallow-water SSP inversion to avoid the boundary parameter mismatch. We propose a joint artificial neural network (ANN) and ray theory SSP inversion model to reduce the computational time at the working phase by fitting the nonlinear relationship from the signal propagation time to the SSP, and once the relationship is established, the goal of reducing the computational time can be achieved. To make the ANN better learn the SSP distribution in a target region and ensure a good inversion accuracy, we give an empirical data selection strategy. Then we propose a virtual SSP generation algorithm to help ANN training in the case of under-fitting problems caused by insufficient training data. Simulation results show that our approach can provide a reliable and instantaneous monitoring of shallow-water SSP distribution.},

The precoding (spreading) technique is a viable way to simultaneously address the aforementioned issues, and it has long been researched in the wireless communication field. In the past decade, it has also gained increasing attention in multicarrier UWA communications. However, a comprehensive study on precoded OFDMs over UWA channels is still lacking. In this work, a unified system model accommodating linear precoding schemes is introduced for precoded OFDMs. Based on the model, a linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) detector is developed for performance evaluation. Several typical precoding schemes are then evaluated and compared, in terms of PAPR and uncoded bit error rate (UBER), over the UWA channels measured in an at-sea experiment. This analysis showed the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and the inverse DFT (IDFT) precoding schemes achieve the lowest PAPR. In terms of UBER, the DFT, IDFT, and discrete cosine transform (DCT) precodings achieved comparable performance that is significantly better than that of the standard OFDM over highly frequency-selective experimental channels.},

We focus on the practical challenges and their mitigation strategies related to TDA-MAC to increase its robustness in real-world deployments, compared with theoretical and simulation-based studies. The lessons learned from the sea trials reported in this paper prompted several crucial modifications to TDA-MAC which form a solid foundation for further work on the development of TDA-MAC based UASNs.},

The formation and collaboration of swarm members yet requires communication and self-localization based on cheap, miniature acoustic devices. However, this is severely hampered by the effects of multi-path propagation and scattering in shallow waters. In general, we discovered improvements of chirp-based---i.e., frequency-sweep---synchronization in these scenarios. This paper presents strategies to find proper chirp parameters. First, we study the benefits and applicability of chirp-based modulation against FSK. Second, we discuss the impact of the chirp parameters in real-world scenarios and identify sweep spots w.r.t. bandwidth to improve the standard deviation of the position in the time domain up to 86 % above this point. Third, we present instructions to choose these parameters in an efficient and appropriate way for any shallow water scenario.},

Combining the advantages of optics and acoustics, this paper proposes a joint imaging method with acoustic communication-assisted decision-making and optical image stitching, aiming to improve information acquisition efficiency in the ocean visualization process. The joint imaging method relies on sonar technology as the decision-making layer to obtain the position information, then it sends instructions to AUV by acoustic communication and get the details of the target by the AUV-mounted camera which forms the executive layer. Finally, it conducts smoothing and mosaic processing on the optical image. The system can efficiently obtain complete, comprehensive, and detailed ocean visualization information through the advantages of agility of acoustic and accuracy of optics.},

A key trade off in these systems is number of antennas and corresponding beam-width.

We demonstrate how interference between coincident nodes cause a significant number of packet drops even with a very large number of antennas.

We propose a novel Q-learning-based adaptive modulation-switching strategy. During the communication, the CSI is estimated from the handshake signals or training sequences, etc., in each communication block at the receiver, and the CSI is then sent back to the transmitter at the feedback channel. The transmitter adaptively selects an appropriate modulation method via Q-learning. The utility of the proposed strategy is based on essential communication parameters such as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), energy consumption and bit error rate (BER). We conducted simulation tests to testify to the performance of the proposed strategy. Two modulation methods, (i.e., multi-carrier multiple-frequency shift keying (MC-MFSK) and quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK)), which have distinct features in underwater acoustic channel (UWA) communication, are considered in the tests. The performance is evaluated with simulations for the shallow-sea tide condition, and the results show that our proposed adaptive modulation-switching strategy performs well compared with a random selection strategy.},

While this capability would enable new applications and services, it also raises concerns about citizens' privacy. In this work, we propose a carefully-crafted obfuscating technique against one of such CSI-based localization methods. In particular, we modify the transmitted I/Q samples by leveraging an irreversible randomized sequence. I/Q symbol manipulation at the transmitter distorts the location-specific information in the CSI while preserving communication, so that an attacker can no longer derive information on user's location. We test this technique against a Neural Network (NN)-based localization system and show that the randomization of the CSI makes undesired localization practically unfeasible. Both the localization system and the randomization CSI management are implemented in real devices. The experimental results obtained in our laboratory show that the considered localization method (first proposed in an MSc thesis) works smoothly regardless of the environment, and that adding random information to the CSI mess up the localization, thus providing the community with a system that preserve location privacy and communication performance at the same time.},

Such an approach has the advantage of being very low complexity and easy to implement. However, custom beam patterns adapted to the current channel can provide much better performance than generic pre-defined patterns. In this demo, we show how to measure channel state information and modify beam patterns on the TP-Link Talon AD7200 router operating in the 60 GHz band. This allows to generate custom beam patterns with arbitrary shape, as well as beam patterns that maximize the signal strength of a link given the current channel. Our demo allows users to select custom beam patterns and visualizes the beam pattern in use. It is also possible to compare the custom patterns to the pre-defined beam patterns of the router and measure the performance in terms of throughput and signal strength.},

	abstract     = {The high bandwidth available at millimeter-wave frequencies allows for very high data rates, and the latest wireless technologies, such as IEEE 802.11ad, are already exploiting this part of the radio spectrum to achieve rates of several GBit/s. Unfortunately, experimental millimeter-wave research is hampered by the lack of inexpensive yet flexible testbed platforms. While off-the-shelf 802.11ad devices only provide very limited programmability, current software-defined radios typically do not offer the bandwidth necessary for millimeter-wave systems. This keynote talk will give an overview of recent work that deals with millimeter-wave networking challenges, with a particular focus on the testbed platforms we developed. The talk covers low overhead continuous beam tracking on an 802.11ad compliant system with a phased array and an implementation of compressive beam training on commercial off-the-shelf devices. The very large bandwidth at mm-wave frequencies also allows, in principle, to design highly accurate location systems. Location information can in turn be used to facilitate beam training, optimize access point association, predict (and counteract) future blockage, etc. The talk will present a location system we implemented on off-the-shelf 802.11ad devices, that only uses coarse angle information extracted from the beam training process. Finally, the talk will present some ongoing work on a full-bandwidth software-defined radio platform for millimeter wave experimentation.},

As such, anyone is allowed to deploy their own LoRaWAN network, provided that they adhere to the LoRaWAN specification and ISM regulations. However, an uncoordinated deployment of LoRaWAN networks may cause neighboring networks to interfere and LoRaWAN frames to collide. In this paper, we present an in-depth investigation of LoRaWAN frame collisions -- and the capture effect in particular -- through various experiments. Contrary to previous research, we focus on correct reception of data at the application, instead of at the gateway, and we consider multi-gateway, multi-provider, and dense scenarios to obtain insight into collisions within actual networks.},

	abstract     = {Monitoring networks requires efficiently detecting abnormal events and summarizing connection information in big volumes of packet-level data. Some of these tasks can be accomplished with network and operating system utilities, but questions should be relatively simple and data pre-processing should be kept at a minimum. Another requirement is to be able to process data, both in a centralized and decentralized manner given the dynamic nature of TCP-IP packet flow. On the other hand, database systems can answer complex questions phrased as queries, provided data is in the right format and is quickly loaded. Having such motivation in mind, we propose to monitor a network with queries, running on a traditional DBMS (i.e. not a custom-built system programmed in C or C++). Thus, queries can be processed in a central manner in a traditional database server or in a distributed fashion with edge computing. A brief experimental evaluation shows queries can indeed be used to monitor the network with low latency and reasonable delay.},

Specifically, we propose the employment of an on-board timer circuit that consumes only few nano Amperes, along with a power switch that controls the power rail of the under consideration node. According to our principle, the node remains solely disconnected from power when in sleep state in an effort to minimize the quiescent draw, while the timer is responsible for reinforcing the node back in active mode when required. Our implementation achieves the minimization of power draw in sleep state down to 33 nA, while it can easily be integrated with any IoT platform.},

In this paper, we evaluate experimentally, for the first time, the accuracy of a positioning system based on the Angle of Arrival (AoA) mechanism adopted by the Bluetooth standard. We first scrutinize the fidelity of angular detection and then assess the feasibility of using angle information from multiple fixed receivers to determine the position of a device. Our results reveal that angular detection is limited to a restricted range. On the other hand, even in a simple deployment with only two antennas per receiver, the AoA-based positioning technique can achieve sub-meter accuracy; yet attaining localization within a few centimeters remains a difficult endeavor. We then demonstrate that a malicious device may be able to easily alter the truthfulness of the measured AoA, by tampering with the packet structure. To counter this protocol weakness, we propose simple remedies that are missing in the standard, but which can be adopted with little effort by manufacturers, to secure the Bluetooth 5.1 positioning system.},

To this end, we port GNU Radio, a state-of-theart, open source, real-time stream-data processing framework, to Android and evaluate its performance.We show that it is possible to fully benefit from available accelerators, i.e., Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) and the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), which provide considerable speedups and allow for efficient implementations. As a general-purpose real-time data processing framework, GNU Radio can provide the base for a wide range of applications.

	abstract     = {Wireless backscatter communication can provide ultra-low power backhaul to Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, which usually have very limited energy budgets. With proliferation of IoT widgets into human activities, an important design goal for the backhaul is to connect as many devices as possible, which are featured by short bursts of data. The crux to achieve this goal is to enhance concurrency of the wireless backscatter network, so that many concurrent transmissions can be supported. Orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) is a multiple access mechanism based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), which is a multi-carrier modulation mechanism widely used in modern wireless systems including 802.11 a/g/n/ac, 4G and 5G. This talk focuses on how to enable OFDMA in the wireless backscatter network, which not only maintains the advantage of ultra-low power consumption but also improve the system concurrency. The major challenge for enabling OFDMA in wireless backscatter is to achieve the strict synchronization in both time and frequency domain. In fact, the synchronization is critical for all the OFDMA systems; however, in the OFDMA backscatter network, the signal at the receiver side is reflected from backscattering devices (tags), thus introduce more opportunities for offsets in both time and frequency domain, which incurs new challenges in the system design. This talk presents the major challenges in realizing OFDMA backscatter network, and provide our solutions to deal with those problems. The design for excitation signal transmitter, tag and receiver will be explained. The phenomena we observed in realizing the system will be illustrated. Moreover, the new issues discovered in existing OFDMA backscatter is to be revealed, and the preliminary result for the future work is also to be presented.},

The evaluation of Channel State Information (CSI) during the reception of a frame preamble is fundamental to properly equalizing the rest of the transmission at the receiver side. Reporting this state information back to the transmitter facilitates mechanisms such as beamforming and MIMO, thus boosting the network performance. While these features are an integral part of standards such as 802.11ac, accessing CSI data on commercial devices is either not possible, limited to outdated chipsets or very inflexible. This hinders the research and development of innovative CSI-dependent techniques including localization, object tracking, and interference evaluation. To help researchers and practitioners, we introduce the nexmon CSI Extractor Tool. It allows per-frame CSI extraction for up to four spatial streams using up to four receive chains on modern Broadcom and Cypress Wi-Fi chips with up to 80MHz bandwidth in both the 2.4 and 5GHz bands. The tool supports devices ranging from the low-cost Raspberry Pi platform, over mobile platforms such as Nexus smartphones to state-of-the-art Wi-Fi APs. We release all tools and Wi-Fi firmware patches as extensible open source project.

It is unclear whether a transport layer solution like Multipath TCP (MPTCP) could serve better in aggregating multiple RATs than radio level aggregation, Or are these two different solutions complementing each other? In this paper, we address these questions by experimenting on a testbed. LWA testbed has been set up using OpenAirInterface (OAI) LTE base station and off-the-shelf Wi-Fi Access Point (AP). We present interesting outcomes of various experiments which can be adopted as design principles for developing 5G Multi-RAT architectures. Our findings include, (i) LWA fails to aggregate link capacities when there is congestion in the network, and (ii) Co-operative MPTCP and LWA solution is robust and achieves significant performance improvement compared to individual LWA and MPTCP, even when the network is congested and Wi-Fi channel contention is high.},

The complexity of today's network systems makes evaluations in physical testbeds mandatory to capture real-world effects. However, this causes methodological and technical issues and challenges researchers in handling their agile testbed deployments. In contrast to Internet-scale testbeds, most agile experiments require specific topologies, specialized hardware, or a custom environment. They typically run only a few times and demand live user interaction. Existing management systems for Internet-scale testbeds do not accommodate these needs due to their complexity and maintenance overhead. In this paper, we present TPy, a lightweight and flexible framework to conduct distributed network experiments. TPy is written in Python and extendable via modules. To demonstrate its versatility and ease-of-use, we use TPy to perform experiments in the domains of millimeter-wave and secure multi-hop communications.

Core and radio access functionalities are virtualized and executed in edge data centers, in accordance with the Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) principle. While testbeds are an essential research tool for experimental evaluation in such environments, the landscape of data center and mobile network testbeds is fragmented. In this work, we aim at filling this gap by presenting openLEON, an open source muLti-access Edge cOmputiNg end-to-end emulator that operates from the edge data center to the mobile users. openLEON bridges the functionalities of existing emulators for data centers and mobile networks, i.e., Mininet and srsLTE, and makes it possible to evaluate and validate research ideas on all the components of an end-to-end mobile edge architecture.},

After having implemented two different attack techniques over two different Software-Defined-Radio (SDR) platforms (OpenAirInterface and srsLTE), we have tested these attacks over different versions of the mobile phone brands, for a total of 19 different radio modems tested. We show that while the majority of devices surrender almost immediately, iPhones seem to implement some cleverness that resembles proper countermeasures. We also bring about evidence that the two chosen SDR platforms implement different signaling procedures that differentiate their ability as IMSI-catchers. We finally analyse IMSI-catchers' behaviors against subscribers of different operators, showing that successfulness of the attack depends only on the chipset and the SDR tool. We believe that our analysis may be useful either to practitioners that need to experiment with mobile security, as well as engineers for improving the design of mobile modems.},

Several architectural components are crucial for enabling the envisioned capabilities of the testbed. In this paper, after providing a high level overview of AERPAW, we first present the emulation design of AERPAW vehicles. Subsequently, we describe various different options for wireless channel emulation in AERPAW. We start with a generalized model for wireless emulation, and expand that model to packet-level emulation, I-Q level emulation, and radio-frequency (RF)-level emulation.

Wireless networks and their adequate emulation play an important role in evaluation, but emulation of wireless links and networks is still difficult to handle. In this paper, we present a low-cost, fixed-network testbed able to emulate the dynamically changing conditions of wireless links caused by client mobility and physical phenomena. We extend the existing fixed-network testbed for the purpose of wireless network emulation using the Linux tools tc, iptables, and NetEm in sophisticated ways. Convenient function blocks are provided to configure wireless network topologies as well as dynamic link and mobility conditions to be emulated with modest efforts. We utilize the testbed's capabilities to investigate the influence of different mobility models on streaming SVC-encoded videos in Named Data Networking (NDN), a novel Information-Centric Networking architecture. Furthermore, we evaluate the benefits of using early loss detection mechanisms for streaming in NDN, by implementing Wireless Loss Detection and Recovery (WLDR). Our results show that the extended fixed-network testbed can precisely emulate wireless network conditions and usage. For instance, the emulation revealed that both the choice of the mobility model and the use of WLDR have a substantial influence on the resulting SVC video streaming performance.},

A spectrum monitoring system, coupled with signal paths after all amplifiers in the transmit chain, can detect these emissions. However, incident radio frequency energy combines with the output signal, which is no longer buffered by the amplifier. Incident and transmitted signals must be separated and isolated. The monitor can then analyze the isolated transmitted signal for out-of-band energy. This paper presents a system that can achieve isolation and identify users that broadcast out-of-band.},

	abstract     = {Backscattering RFIDs have emerged as a versatile platform for low-power wireless networking and sensing in the era of Internet-of-Things (IoT). At the same time, millimeter-wave (mmWave) wireless has gained substantial attraction with high-speed WLAN and 5G cellular networks. Although the majority of RFID backscatter research focuses on lower frequencies, mmWave backscatter provides unique opportunities due to its directionality and wide bandwidth. Existing mmWave backscatter systems rely on expensive, custom-designed, dedicated readers which limit their widespread use. In this work, we present an empirical characterization of the first-of-its-kind mmWave backscatter system using 60 GHz commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) 802.11ad radios. Our presented system only relies on Channel State Information (CSI) and requires no modification to hardware or protocol. Through experimentation, we demonstrate that mmWave backscatter can be detected at a distance of up to 6m at different angles and locations. We also present how the backscatter can be leveraged in estimating the blockages in a WLAN which can reduce the beamsearching overhead. Our work opens a new direction of research where mmWave backscatter can be used to realize an integrated mmWave networking, sensing, and applications.},

First, we integrated a customized 1st generation (Gen-1) narrowband FD radio in the indoor ORBIT testbed. Then, we integrated two 2nd generation (Gen-2) wideband FD radios in the city-scale PAWR COSMOS testbed. Each integrated FD radio consists of an antenna, a customized RF self-interference (SI) canceller box, a USRP software-defined radio (SDR), and a remotely accessible compute node. The Gen-1/Gen-2 RF SI canceller box includes an RF canceller printed circuit board (PCB) which emulates a customized integrated circuit (IC) RF canceller implementation. The amplitude- and phase-based Gen-1 narrowband RF canceller achieves 40 dB RF SIC across 5 MHz. The Gen-2 wideband canceller is based on the technique of frequency-domain equalization (FDE) and achieves 50 dB RF SI cancellation (SIC) across 20 MHz. In this paper, we present the design and testbed integration of the two generations of FD radios. We then present example experiments that can be remotely run and modified by experimenters. Finally, we discuss future improvements and potential FD wireless experiments that can be supported by these open-access FD radios integrated in the COSMOS testbed.},

Nonetheless, the security of screen-camera communications in mobile applications has largely been disregarded, despite the fact that information displayed on an open screen is easily intercepted. One-way communication systems also make it difficult to add security features. In this paper, we propose a secure screen-camera communication system in which a visual encryption algorithm is designed to camouflage transmitted images between the screen and camera. When the targeted receiver holds a camera in a designated viewing position (i.e., directly in front of the screen at a distance of 50cm), the camouflaged image is revealed due to aliasing effect. From any other position, only the camouflaged image can be seen.},

This revolutionary discovery is creating unique opportunities to turn any mobile device screen into solar energy harvester. In this paper, we consider the possibility of using such energy harvesting screens as a sensor to detect hand gestures. As different gestures impact the incident light on the screen in a different way, they are expected to create unique energy generation patterns for the transparent solar cell. Our goal is to recognize gestures by detecting these solar energy patterns. A key uncertainty we face with transparent solar cell is that, to provide transparency, they cannot harvest from the visible spectra, which may lead to weaker energy patterns for the gestures. To study gesture recognition feasibility of transparent solar cell, we develop a 1cmx1cm organic see-through solar cell which provides high level of content visibility when placed on mobile phone screen. We then use the output current of the organic cell as the source signal for gesture pattern recognition using machine learning. Experimental results demonstrate that we can detect five hand gestures with average accuracies of 95%. We also compare gesture recognition accuracies of our prototype organic cell with those obtained from a conventional ceramic opaque solar cell, which reveals that organic solar cell can recognize some of these gestures almost as good as the opaque cells.},

	abstract     = {In emerging 5G wireless systems, Mobile Social Networks (MSN) will play an important role for providing data services and offloading data traffic from cellular networks. MSNs are vulnerable to various security attacks because of the ways users move and collaborate. Since most protocols for MSNs are designed based on social behaviors of users, it is important to understand the impact of user behavior on network vulnerability. This can provide valuable insights into crucial factors, such as how easily a network loses its connectivity, or a network's ability to form strong communities. We present a novel vulnerability assessment and classification scheme based on structural, social and influence distribution metrics in mobile social networks. We design a vulnerability index metric (VI) to investigate the level of damage inflicted when networks are subjected to both targeted and random attacks. Then, we use influence distribution metrics and various machine learning based classifiers to determine the vulnerability levels for various network states. Finally, we define a Mean Information Diffusion index to determine the information dissemination capability of a network, given the vulnerability state. Our results revealed that campus WLAN traces, represented by the Time Variant Community model, exhibit highly vulnerable states that reduce the network's ability to disseminate information by up to 16%.},

Our optimization problem is based on system sum-rate maximization under the QoS constraint. We propose a joint radio resource allocation scheme where we use Lagrange duality and dual update method to find a solution for the optimal allocation of subcarrier and power in OFDMA system and optimal time share in WLAN system. Numerical results show that the overall sum-throughput of our proposed optimal resource allocation algorithm in HWAN for multi-RAT approach outperforms the single RAT approach that uses WLAN or OFDMA based system. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of minimum data rate requirement of mobile users on the convergence rate of our proposed algorithm. Matlab based simulation results show that convergence rate of our propose algorithm is independent of the minimum data rate requirement of users.},

It consists of a considerable amount of devices, also known as motes, with sensory capacity and wireless connectivity geographically spread in a wide area. Such devices face limitations in terms of energy, memory and processing. A common topology in LLN is a mesh-like one. The communication between these devices often happens in a multi-hop fashion due to their limited transmission range. Therefore, there is a need of efficient routing protocols for LLNs in terms of energy consumption and delivery rate. The present paper depicts a mesh routing protocol based on the Ant Colony Optimization meta-heuristic. Our proposed scheme has been integrated in the Contiki's Rime stack implementation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach had a better performance in terms of packet delivery rates, energy consumption and network lifetime.},

	abstract     = {Every day large numbers of users connect to IEEE 802.11 networks in order to access the Internet and all sorts of services. However, due to their unplanned and unregulated nature, and the lack of admission control and Quality of Service Guarantees, these wireless networks can experience traffic demand that exceeds the network capacity. In this case, if a device tries to send more traffic, or if a new device joins the network, the aggregate throughput does not necessarily increase. In this paper we show that it is possible for IEEE 802.11 stations to detect a saturated channel by passively monitoring the beacon frames. Access points (AP) send beacon frames periodically and encode them using the strongest modulation and coding scheme, so that even stations far away from the sending APs can decode them correctly. When sending beacons, APs sense the channel first and, if it is busy, delay sending the frame, resulting in unevenly spaced beacon frames, whenever other transmitters are active. We present several experiments, under varying traffic loads, and analyze the distribution of the beacon jitter, whose variance increases as the offered load increases. We show that it is possible to determine, with an acceptable error rate, whether a channel is saturated by comparing the distribution of the beacon jitter with a reference distribution corresponding to a saturated channel.},

We tested the algorithm using different densities of sensors in the network and different values of tuning parameters for the optimization parameters. Obtained results show that our proposed algorithm performs better than the other greedy algorithm. Moreover, networks with more sensors maintain more redundancy and better percentage of coverage.

In order to improve mobility management in a SDWN, we realize the centralized LISP (Locator/ID Separation Protocol) management system with the following features: 1) the LISP/OpenFlow centralized control entity and 2) interoperability with standard LISP systems. It is named LISP-SDWN and it is a double separation solution based on Control/Data decomposition and Locator/ID separation. The operation cost might decrease because ID of the Mobile Node (MN) does not change during handover across heterogeneous Radio Access Networks (RANs) in a SDWN. The major contributions of our research are that there will be no modification requirement of the LISP functions during LISP deployment in a SDWN and there will be a capability for inter-networking with external LISP sites operated by other service providers. Performance evaluation of LISP-SDWN is carried out with LISP, LISP Controller, MIPv6 and HMIPv6. Result shows that the proposed LISP-SDWN is a feasible and practical solution for a SDWN provider.},

To solve above problems, we will provide a traffic flow prediction solution in this paper.

A performance study using the discrete-event simulator ns-3 illustrates the benefits of the proposed approach. We find that a high retransmission rate results in a low utilization of the acknowledgment window and discuss its major negative impact on the goodput. Our delay-related studies further show that MAC mechanisms like strict ordering contribute disproportionally to increased latency due to head-of-line blocking, especially under high error rate conditions. We conclude that for decreased delays, smaller MPDUs are beneficial.},

	abstract     = {In 4G networks, the emergence of machine communications such as connected vehicles increases the high demand of uplink transmissions, thus, degrading the quality of service per user equipment. Enforcing quality-of-service in such cellular network is challenging, as radio phenomenon, as well as user (and their devices) mobility and dynamics, are uncontrolled. To solve this issue, estimating what the quality of transmissions will be in a short future for a connected user is essential. For that purpose, we argue that radio metrics are key features whose evolutions can help predicting the bandwidth that the considered connections can take advantage of in the following hundreds of milliseconds. The paper then describes how a 4G testbed has been deployed in order to study the correlation between radio noise and throughput in uplink transmissions. Based on radio measurements, the main supervised machine learning algorithms are used, such as Random Forest and Support Vector Machine to predict the uplink received bandwidth. For a specific user service, we are able to predict the end-to-end received bandwidth, i.e. the amount of received data on the server side during a specific period at a very low scale of 100 ms. Results also prove that uplink bandwidth predictions are less accurate compared to bandwidth prediction for downlink based on radio measurements.},

	abstract     = {We consider a special type of Delay Tolerant Network (DTN), called "Local-Ferry-based network" (LFN), which enables communication among multiple nodes distributed over a geographic terrain. LFN utilizes controllable special purpose vehicles called "pigeons" to transfer messages among neighboring nodes: some (or all) nodes own these message ferries (a.k.a. pigeons), which help in establishing communication links among local nodes, cumulatively setting up the whole network. One research challenge is to schedule the pigeon movement between local nodes (i.e., deciding the pigeon's visiting sequence of the local nodes) to achieve good networking performance (e.g., message delay). Solving this research challenge poses promise for many exciting applications, such as using drones to enable communication among segregated regions in disaster recovery, to augment/connect in-situ IoT deployments, and more. In this paper, we address the above challenge whereas we contribute the following. First, we analyze what it takes to optimize the scheduling algorithm for a pigeon. Second, using the above results we design multiple variants of scheduling algorithms, and we compare their performance with the theoretical optimal delay and with the state-of-the-art algorithms through simulation experiments. Both theoretical analysis and simulation results show the efficacy of our solution. For instance, our best scheduling algorithm achieves (within 5% margin) the theoretical optimal (per-hop) message delay.},

Microgrids can experience islanded operational mode, being this mode a time sensitive event that affects costs of power generation and distribution. The detection of time-sensitive events is important because the control unit needs to be aware of changes in the grid to avoid losses in power quality and costs. This requires a quality of service (QoS)-aware data aggregation and queuing mechanism in the core of the network infrastructure to convey microgrid data to a central server (considered as a macro base station). This paper investigates the impact of time sensitivity-based microgrid data aggregation on message delivery under different priority and time-sensitivity levels. Hence, we propose a framework to cluster the electrical data based on the time sensitivity criteria using unsupervised machine learning. We introduce a multi-class queuing system in the pico-cells to ensure that clustering reduces the processing time for high priority data. The results show that the proposed approach significantly reduces the delivery delay of messages carrying time sensitive events from the microgrid.},

As the number of smartphone users and the amount of data transferred per smartphone grow exponentially, limited battery power is becoming an increasingly critical problem for mobile devices which depend on the network I/O. Despite the growing body of research in power management techniques for the mobile devices at the hardware layer as well as the lower layers of the networking stack, there has been little work focusing on saving energy at the application layer for the mobile systems during network I/O. In this paper, we propose a novel technique, called FastHLA, that can achieve significant energy savings at the application layer during mobile network I/O without sacrificing the performance. FastHLA is based on historical log analysis and real-time dynamic tuning of mobile data transfers to achieve the optimization goal. FastHLA can increase the data transfer throughout by up to 10X and decrease the energy consumption by up to 5X compared to state-of-the-art HTTP/2.0 transfers.},

Not only transmission range, but also packet loss and received signal strength were evaluated. A large set of radio configurations was used to study the impact of transmission power, bit rate, and packet size. Also, the relationship between packet loss and received signal strength was investigated. A model could be developed that can help determine the expected packet loss rates as a function of the radio configurations and measured RSSI values.},

However, research and development in this field are hindered because there is a lack of a framework that can be easily extended to collect various types of monitoring data from the WiFi stack. In this paper, we propose FLIP, a framework for leveraging eBPF to augment WiFi access points and investigate the performance of WiFi networks. Using this framework, we focus on two important aspects of monitoring the WiFi stack. First, considering the high delay experienced by packets at access points, we show how switching packets from the wired interface to the wireless interface can be monitored and timestamped accurately at each step. We build a testbed using FLIP access points and investigate the factors affecting packet delay experienced in access points. Second, we present a novel approach that allows access points to track the duty-cycling pattern and energy consumption of their associated stations accurately and without the need for any external energy measurement tools. We validate the high energy measurement accuracy of FLIP by empirical experiments and comparisons against a commercial tool.},

	abstract     = {Wi-Fi is one of the key wireless technologies for the Internet of things (IoT) owing to its ubiquity. Low-power operation of commercial Wi-Fi enabled IoT modules (typically powered by replaceable batteries) is critical in order to achieve a long battery life, while maintaining connectivity, and thereby reduce the cost and frequency of maintenance. In this work, we focus on commonly used sparse periodic uplink traffic scenario in IoT. Through extensive experiments with a state-of-the-art Wi-Fi enabled IoT module (Texas Instruments SimpleLink CC3235SF), we study the performance of the power save mechanism (PSM) in the IEEE 802.11 standard and show that the battery life of the module is limited, while running thin uplink traffic, to ~30% of its battery life on an idle connection, even when utilizing IEEE 802.11 PSM. Focusing on sparse uplink traffic, a prominent traffic scenario for IoT (e.g., periodic measurements, keep-alive mechanisms, etc.), we design a simulation framework for single-user sparse uplink traffic on ns-3, and develop a detailed and platform-agnostic accurate power consumption model within the framework and calibrate it to CC3235SF. Subsequently, we present five potential power optimization strategies (including standard IEEE 802.11 PSM) and analyze, with simulation results, the sensitivity of power consumption to specific network characteristics (e.g., round-trip time (RTT) and relative timing between TCP segment transmissions and beacon receptions) to present key insights. Finally, we propose a standard-compliant client-side cross-layer power saving optimization algorithm that can be implemented on client IoT modules. We show that the proposed optimization algorithm extends battery life by 24%, 26%, and 31% on average for sparse TCP uplink traffic with 5 TCP segments per second for networks with constant RTT values of 25 ms, 10 ms, and 5 ms, respectively.},

In our experiments, we selected four baseline models to demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution.

With the arrival of wireless and mobile networks such as 5G, the characterization of contacts between users becomes more and more important. Thereof, protocols, algorithms and applications started to lure on this kind of information. However, we still have to understand better how these interactions change over time and what are the factors that rule them. In this work, we analyze a mobility trace containing data about Wi-Fi users in a university campus over the period of one year to understand how time and space affect their relationships. To do so, we use a set of previously studied metrics to classify contacts between users into random and social. This classification is based on the number of contacts in common between two users and their encounter regularity, i.e., how frequently they meet during their routine. Additionally, this study contributes by going one step further and classifying users into those same categories according to their contacts distribution. Then, we consider how these users and contacts evolve over time, and what is the role of location and time in this evolution. Finally, we discuss how such evolution information can be used to provide better solutions in mobile networks, such as through the ability to predict how long a contact will last, or the ability to measure how qualified a certain user is to deliver a message.},

Equipped with sensors and cameras, these technologies can perform much on-demand critical application ranging from military and environmental to rescue operations. These UAVs devices, sometimes tiny, that can replace human and manned aircraft in several tasks, have been utilized to perform various types of services and applications more efciently. However, the deployment side of such emerging technology is still facing many issues and challenges. Using multi-drones or swarm of drones, together to accomplish one operation is one of these recent challenges. Such a system requires a high level of delicacy and cooperation to achieve the required autonomy and reduce human interaction as possible. Communication is one of the biggest challenges in these systems, since the devices should keep exchanging various types of messages with different Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. In this paper, a collaborative autonomous system of swarm drones based on deep learning has been proposed and a testbed of cooperative UAVs' mission to validate the performance of the dedicated QoS communication system using Paparazzi drones The proposed system is aware of the drones' requirements in term of QoS and able to meet with their dynamic demands.},

In this context, we propose a methodology to quantify the power of point-of-interests (POIs) in their vicinity, in terms of impact and independence - the first work in the literature (to the best of our knowledge). Different from literature, we consider the flow of people in our analysis, instead of the number of neighbor POIs or their structural locations in the city. Thus, we first modeled POI's visits using the multiflow graph model where each POI is a node and the transitions of users among POIs are a weighted direct edge. Using this multiflow graph model, we compute the attract, support and independence powers. The attract power and support power measure how many visits a POI gather from and disseminate over its neighborhood, respectively. Moreover, the independence power captures the capacity of POI to receive visitors independently from other POIs. Using a dataset describing the mobility of individuals in the Dartmouth College campus, we identify a slight dependence among buildings as well as the tendency of people to be mostly stationary in few buildings with short transit periods among them.},

In this context, this paper proposes a methodology to detect anomalous behavior of wireless devices by monitoring their power consumption patterns. The proposed methodology utilizes Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to extract information from the current power consumption of the device and generates features of the state of the device by calculating the degree of similarity of the extracted information with the known normal behavior of the device. Then, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) is used to select features from the generated feature vector. Finally, Classification algorithms are used to classify and detect the anomalous behavior. We have validated the methodology by emulating anomalous behavior on smartphones through a custom designed app that runs in the background while the main app is being used. Validation results indicate that the proposed methodology can be used to identify even a sparsely active malware existence with very high accuracy. The proposed model has an accuracy of 88% for a malware active for 1% of the total time and accuracy of almost 100% for malware active for 12% of the time.},

	abstract     = {A beacon in Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET) is a periodic message that contains status information of a vehicle such as id, velocity, location and other information that is needed by routing protocols and safety as well as non-safety applications. Generating beacons at high rate is desirable as it can potentially increase the freshness of the exchanged information (neighborhood awareness). However, this causes network congestion and high resources consumption. On the other hand, generating few beacons saves bandwidth and reduces congestion, but leads to outdated information. Thus, adaptive schemes that adjust the beacon transmission rates based on different situations are required. In this paper, we propose a high awareness adaptive beaconing (HAAB) scheme that is based on fuzzy logic. This scheme uses signal to interference-noise ratio (SINR), number of neighboring nodes and mobility factors as inputs to a fuzzy logic system. The scheme employs the fuzzy logic system to determine the congestion rank and uses it to adapt the beacon transmission frequency. Simulations using NS-3 have been conducted to investigate the effectiveness of our proposed protocol. HAAB is shown to have the highest neighborhood awareness compared to other protocols in both highway and urban environments.},

These applications are focused on driver safety, as well as on the management and control of the flow of vehicles on the roads. Thus, reducing the impact of congestion and events that may occur on the roads. Most of these applications are offered by information centers in which the vehicle needs access to the internet. In this context, the vehicles need to be connected to an escalation infrastructure in which access to the service is maximized. Therefore, the efficient use of these services is necessary that this connection is continuous. For this, a traffic mobility management mechanism is required that allows a continuous data flow, as well as a transparent access point exchange system enabling that the users do not perceive an interruption in their connection as well as a change in the access point.In this paper, we propose the development of a decision and management mechanism based on fuzzy logic that would indicate whether the vehicle should perform the change of access point or not; and determine to which access point a certain flow should migrate. This mechanism aims to minimize the number of exchanges between access points, eliminating unnecessary exchanges. For the development of this mechanism, we considered the use NS3 simulator to analyze the policy of interface selection and compare it with some related works of the literature. The results showed that the proposed mechanism reduced packet loss, resulting in a shorter delay in the delivery of information.},

In this paper, we design a two-layer hierarchical mobility model to model user mobility in the city of Rio de Janeiro and its suburbs by analyzing cellular network connectivity data during the COVID-19 pandemic. To this end, we collaborate with one of the main network providers in Brazil, TIM Brazil, to collect user connectivity logs from April 5th, 2020 to July 2nd, 2020, which we use to generate mobility graphs. We adopt the Louvain community detection algorithm in the first layer of our hierarchical model to detect the main communities in the city from the mobility graphs. Our model then uses the KMeans++ and Agglomerative clustering methods in the second layer to identify high, medium, and low mobility clusters within each community. Via extensive experiments, we show that the Louvain, and the Kmeans++ and Agglomerative algorithms outperform traditional clustering approaches in the first and second layers, respectively. Our results also demonstrate that our hierarchical model is able to pinpoint main mobility locations within each community and can be used by authorities to implement partial lockdown measures in place of widely unpopular complete lockdowns.},

A large amount of research in this field is dedicated to the evaluation of various communication protocols, e.g., broadcast or convergecast, against human body mobility. Most of the time this evaluation is done via simulations and in many situations only synthetic data is used for the human body mobility. In this paper we propose for the first time in Wireless Body Area Networks a Markovian analytical model specifically designed for WBAN networks. The main objective of the model is to evaluate the efficiency of a multi-hop transmission in the case of a diffusion-based broadcast protocol, with respect to various performance parameters (e.g., cover probability, average cover number, hitting probability or average cover time). We validate our model by comparing its results to simulation and show its accuracy. Finally, but not least, we show how our model can be used to analytically evaluate the trade-off between transmission power and redundancy, when the same message is broadcasted several times in order to increase the broadcast reliability while maintaining a low transmission power.},

The subsystem works by having two accurate models working as a primary and backup; when the primary fails the backup takes over to confirm or deny the conclusion of the primary model. The false acceptance rate (FAR) and false rejection rate (FRR) achieved under the proposed two-step system are shown to be 2.54% and 1.98% respectively, compared to the FAR and FRR of single-step verification, which achieved 3.15% and 9.13% respectively. Furthermore, the proposed system also improves the stability of continuous verification. In this work we show that the single step systems are inconsistent when analyzing small feature sets or slightly varied datasets. During both of these instances, the proposed system stays consistent, maintaining a high verification rate.},

However, LTE has to coexist with other network technologies and especially Wi-Fi. LTE employs the Licensed Assisted Access (LAA) protocol and applies the Listen Before Talk (LBT) technique to efficiently share the communication channel with Wi-Fi. Nonetheless, there is still a big gap in throughput performance between the two technologies, with the LAA-LTE considerably outperforming Wi-Fi. This unfair behavior becomes more severe in a saturation mode scenario, where the two networks are fully loaded. In this paper, we try to ensure the fair coexistence between Wi-Fi and LTE by proportionally changing the maximum packet length for each network by applying an optimization and a heuristic approach. The ultimate goal is to equalize the overall throughput for Wi-Fi and LAA or equalize the individual throughput attained for each communicating device. An admission control scheme is also studied to allocate incoming users between the two networks, while trying to balance the throughput distribution. Our results show that by changing the ratio of packet length between Wi-Fi and LAA-LTE a fair share of the medium can be achieved.},

We propose a slight modification of MQtt protocol to reduce the big volume of data collected and sent by vehicles to infrastructures. Indeed, in the original version of MQtt protocol, when a broker receives data from publishers, it sends them directly to its subscribers without any filtration. As consequence, subscribers may be flooded with unimportant data, which increase the problem in the context where infrastructures should manage a huge volume of data sent by thousands of vehicles. So we propose to model and to analyze formally MQtt-CV protocol, to ensure that the components (broker, publisher, subscriber) that implement this protocol interact correctly and fulfill MQtt requirements.},

Existing solutions fail to balance the requirements in Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), latency and communication overhead, rendering the vehicular broadcast either severe packet losses, long time delay or excessive duplication. In this paper, we propose a Decentralized Cooperative Broadcast (DCB) scheme to provide reliable broadcast in VANETs with short latency and lightweight overhead, where all vehicles jointly piggyback some received data to help other neighbors recover the lost packet, and the broadcast links are also flexibly scheduled to enhance the broadcast efficiency. DCB requires no global information but has comparable performance with those solutions holding hypothetical global network information. We prove that DCB is an optimal solution to enhance the PDR when the broadcast is interference-free, and such potential interference can also be solved in DCB with little cost of a bounded time delay. Simulation results show that DCB can achieve an average PDR of 99.6% in less than 100 ms within a 50-vehicle network, which is far more efficient than existing solutions, even very close to the hypothetical centralized broadcast scheme.},

Network operators are embracing cloud-based IMS to meet increasing multimedia traffic demand. They can easily and cost-efficiently implement multimedia applications while ensuring superior end-user experiences through always-on services and real-time engagement. In this paper, we reveal that cloud-based IMS cannot provide session-level resilience under faults and becomes the bottleneck to high service availability. The root cause lies upon the weak failure recovery mechanisms at both IMS protocol and cloud platform that terminate the on-going IMS control-plane procedure. To address this, we propose a design that provides fault-tolerance to IMS control-plane operations. Our design provides modular redundancy to perform real time failure recovery. As the system operates, the control-plane operations are logged at redundant IMS NFs modules. These logs are replayed from the failed operation to resume IMS working after failure. We build our system prototype of open source IMS over cloud platform. Our results show that we can achieve session-level resilience by performing fail-over procedure within tens of milliseconds under different combinations of IMS control-plane operations failures.},

As large numbers of IoT devices are deployed, the task will be simplified by combining the network connectivity, identity and certificate provisioning, and application-layer connectivity to one process. The solution will also allow the use of a one-time credential for the initial authentication, so that the long-term device certificate is issued automatically after the first connection to the network. The paper analyzes the requirements and architectural design options that implement such a user experience. We consider solutions that transfer short bootstrapping data inside the EAP session and then implement the provisioning and configuration with web APIs over HTTPS.

	abstract     = {New applications in the field of radio networks require a high concentration of micro-machines (micro-robots, sensors/actuators) in a small space. Those devices are characterized by a high volatility and limited computing, storage and energy capabilities. Traditional routing approaches in ad hoc networks are unusable due to a significant amount of additional control traffic and a lack of robustness regarding the instability of the nodes. In this paper, we present an original, efficient and intuitive distributed routing protocol in ultra-dense terahertz networks, called Multipoint-to-Multipoint Routing Protocol (M2MRP), which is an emanation of electrostatic physics. A complexity analysis is performed to compare the M2MRP protocol with classical methods. Our study shows that the proposed protocol takes advantage of the nodes density to define a robust routing policy with a moderate additional traffic control. In addition, routing paths are adapted gradually and continuously according to the nodes location (mobility), availability (failures), congestion and energy level. Simulations show that the M2MRP routing protocol significantly outperforms the well-known routing protocols for dense networks both in terms of the number of exchanged messages and of success rate, making this routing protocol the most suitable for systems such as swarm micro-robots, programmable matter and ultra-dense sensor networks.},

Through extensive experimental evaluation, we show that there are indeed significant performance benefits to be attained by allowing the AP to move intelligently. We also rely on theoretical analysis, simulations, and experimental studies to show that the AP optimal location search problem can be split into two parts: a macro-search problem to minimize average path loss between AP and clients, and a micro-search problem to tackle real-time multipath fading effects. We then present Hermes, a self-positioning WiFi AP system that relies on a suite of algorithms to compute and then move to an optimal location within the network. Using a prototype implementation, we show that Hermes can perform up to 117% better than WiFi with no AP mobility, and up to 73% better than related work that allows for AP mobility.},

	abstract     = {As the demand for mobile data traffic increases and cellular network capacity is reaching its theoretical limit, using the unlicensed spectrum is deemed unavoidable. The deployment of the unlicensed spectrum can be a beneficiary solution to increase the capacity of the network and to reduce the cost of the licensed bands that is required. However, the extension of a cellular network, such as Long-Term Evolution (LTE), over the unlicensed spectrum also entails the requirement of a reliable coexistence between other technologies that freely access the unlicensed bands and mainly Wi-Fi. To enable the equal sharing between the so called License Assisted Access (LAA) - LTE and Wi-Fi a number of mechanisms has been introduced by the regulations imposed by standardization organizations such as 3GPP. The process followed by these mechanisms mainly focuses on the Media Access Control (MAC) layer. However, link adaptation is another key factor that can enable high spectral efficiency, reduce the detrimental effect of non-synchronous communications, and increase the overall performance. To this end, in this paper we investigate the contribution of link adaptation in case of LAA-LTE and Wi-Fi coexistence. In particular, we propose a number of enhancements in Wi-Fi link adaptation to increase its adaptability both in terms of changing channel conditions and in terms of LAA-LTE coexistence. Our results show that LAA-LTE can equally and fairly share the channel with Wi-Fi and that the proposed improvements can significantly increase the Wi-Fi performance whether operating alone or coexisting with LAA-LTE. Finally, a detailed description of the fundamental differences in link adaptation between the two technologies is described shedding light to the performance difference noticed.},

One of the most common applications is smart indoor spaces and detecting human activities in such areas. It is crucial for these systems, to collect data, analyze it, and make decisions based on the analysis. Although this is a quite well-defined pipeline of processing, the overall device energy consumption can be significant for wireless sensor systems to ensure the fidelity of data and longevity of the system. In this paper, we first discuss the energy requirements of common IoT applications using sensor networks. We focus on IoT systems for human activity detection in indoor spaces. Then, we propose a method to maximize energy efficiency for these smart spaces. Lastly, we experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, both with simulation and with our real smart space deployment. Our smart environment deployment consists of a variety of sensors including ultrasonic, microwave and vibration sensors. We demonstrate that our energy efficiency method does not affect data quality, thereby maintaining the accuracy of human activity detection. Our method shows up to 30% energy efficiency improvement.},

In this paper, we focus on one particular coverage, we called Closed Peripheral Coverage (CPC). This type of coverage is present in several realistic application as military camp surveillance, very sensitive buildings (i.e., nuclear center) surveillance, contaminated region monitoring, etc. The objective hence is to detect any intrusion coming from the outside (viewed by at least one multimedia sensor node). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research work addressing this issue. Briefly, CPC problem can be defined as follow: after a random deployment of multimedia sensor nodes around the region of interest (i.e., Building to monitor), the goal is to schedule several sets of nodes (i.e., cover sets) such that each of which forms a closed "ring" around the region of interest. Hence, instead activating all nodes at once, the cover sets are scheduled to be activated serially, which ensures a significant network lifetime prolongation improvement. In this paper, we study the CPC problem and present two variants of a centralized algorithm. The preliminary simulation results show clearly the effectiveness of the proposed approaches by a factor varied from 2 to 8 in comparison to the basic approach.},

	abstract     = {Localization and synchronization are fundamental services in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Many WSN applications often need to know the sensor position and the global time to report a given event detection with a specific location and time. However, such services are performed after the sensors deployment in the sensed field. In this case, setting up each sensor manually becomes an impractical activity, requiring some system that automatically locates and synchronizes the sensor nodes. For this purpose, we developed a joint solution to 3D localization and clock synchronization problems using a hybrid approach, which combines mobile and recursive localization. In our work, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with a GPS is used to fly over the sensor field and broadcast its geographical position and timestamp. Using the messages received from the UAV, the sensor nodes are able to estimate their geographic positions and synchronize their clocks. When a node is located in time and space, it transmits its own position and timestamp to the neighbor nodes. The neighbors use the received information to locate themselves so that this iterative process is propagated throughout the network. Simulations results showed that the proposed solution presents low clock synchronization and positioning errors. In our solution, the cost of the network is also reduced because only one GPS receiver is used for the entire sensor field.},

In order to support these different types of services, slicing is a key mechanism for providing logical partitioning of the same physical infrastructure based on the network service demands. Radio resource allocation optimization remains an important aspect in the context of slicing especially when multiple virtual operators with diverse types of services come into play. In such a context, numerous factors should be considered when allocating radio resources such as the available capacity, the diverse resource needs of virtual operators (VO) and the monetary cost of resources allotted by the infrastructure provider. This paper portrays the resource allocation problem as a non-cooperative game then as a Stackelberg game in a multi-VO multi-slice network. In such a context, the infrastructure provider seeks to satisfy the VO minimal throughput requirement via Dynamic Weighted Fair Queuing (DWFQ) while guaranteeing its own monetary profit, whereas VOs strive to selfishly fulfill their throughput requirements in any slice. Through exhaustive simulations, adequate pricing and satisfactory resource allocation to each VO in each slice were obtained based on specific network inputs.},

In this paper we address the construction of an experimental setup in ns3 for evaluating CA algorithms in a DSA WMN environment. Additionally, we propose a solution to the CA problem in this scenario using Simulated Annealing. We simulate TVWS device operation by adding TVWS channels (this can be extended to include any new DSA bands), provide a framework for multi-radio multi-channel WMN experiments, and present and analyse the performance of a CA algorithm.

	abstract     = {The unprecedented growth of wireless mobile traffic, mainly due to multimedia traffic over online social platforms has strained the resources in the mobile backhaul network. A promising approach to reduce the backhaul load is to proactively cache content at the network edge, taking into account the overlaid social network. Known caching schemes require complete knowledge of the social graph and mainly focus on one-to-one interactions forgoing the prevalent mode of content sharing among circles of 'friends'. We propose Bingo, a proactive content caching scheme that leverages the presence of interest groups in online social networks. The mobile network operator (MNO) can choose to incrementally deploy Bingo at select network nodes (base stations, packet core, data center) based on user profiles and revenue numbers. We approximate the group memberships of users using the available user-content request logs without any prior knowledge of the overlaid social graph. Bingo can cater to the evolving nature of online social groups and file popularity distribution for making caching decisions. We use synthetically generated group structures and simulate user requests at the base station for empirical evaluation against traditional and recent caching schemes. Bingo achieves up to 30%-34% gain over the best baseline.},

	abstract     = {The last decades, an increasing interest has been witnessed on the exploitation of unmanned vehicles in fields such as environmental monitoring, commercial air surveillance, domestic policing, geophysical surveys, disaster relief, scientific research, civilian casualties, search and rescue operations, maritime patrol,traffic management, etc. Regardless of the domain (i.e., aerial, ground or surface) that they belong to, the key elements that distinguish them as the leading edge of their technology, are the provided degree of autonomy (i.e., the ability to make decisions without human intervention) and the endurance and the payload that they can support. The mobile IoT paradigm has been significantly expanded with the proliferation of drones and unmanned robotic devices. End-to-end communication and edge decision support are major challenges when operating with mobile nodes and especially with drones. In this paper, we propose a framework that uses two decision making stochastic optimization models of on-line control unit applied on transmission functionalities of mobile and static nodes adaptive to changes in network quality statistics. This is driven by a novel dynamic suppression control of telemetry process and control messages based on the principles of the Optimal Stopping Theory (OST). MOTIVE's time-optimized control mechanism ensures the optimal delivery of critical information from unmanned vehicles to ground control station and vice versa. The main goal, through this proposal, is to significantly enhance the operation of unmanned vehicles when operating under saturated, high traffic wireless networks.},

As this cycle goes on, users share their personal and private data, such as current location, activities, and even their mood, which establish a drawback as users may not want to expose themselves. Therefore, we face a trade-off between sharing personal data and, thus, losing privacy, or not sharing it and, possibly, losing quality of experience in relation to services and applications. In this work, we analyze properties of a mobile phone dataset containing precise information about users' accesses to applications to answer the following questions: (i) What can be inferred from an user at the current time given his/her past information? (ii) How does location data, which is a fundamental information in these networks, affect the inferences? To do this, we apply supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to predict network type -- Mobile or WiFi, application name, and user ID. Our results present an overview of how knowledge can be extracted from data shared by users, and which type of data is the most revealing.},

	abstract     = {Cloud Radio Access Networks (C-RAN) is an evolution in the base station architecture, mainly composed of two elements: The Base Band Unit (BBU) and the Remote Radio Head (RRH). The BBU is a centralized pool of computational resources to provide the signal processing and coordination functionality required by all cells, while the RRHs are light radio units that User Equipment (UE) connects to via the RAN. Many advantages are derived from this architecture, such as dynamic BBU-RRH associations and statistical multiplexing gains. In particular, the BBU-RRH association problem is crucial for reducing power consumption. In this paper, we focus on decentralized BBU-RRH association, which has not received attention in the literature. Therefore, the aim of this work is to propose a hybrid two-stage approach that includes a game theoretic framework for the BBU-RRH association, and a centralized scheme to set the adequate number of available BBUs. The game among RRHs is solved by two different algorithms. The first relies on the best response algorithm, namely H-BR-IACA. The second is based on a reinforcement learning method (the replicator dynamics), namely H-DR-IACA. We compare our devised solution to a centralized approach proposed in a previous work. The results of our proposition show close performance to the centralized method.},

Specifically, we design simple distributed protocols consisting of a small number of states and interaction rules for the construction of both arbitrary and binary trees. Further, we theoretically and experimentally evaluate a plethora of energy redistribution protocols that exploit different levels of knowledge in order to achieve desired energy distributions which require, for instance, that every agent has twice the energy of the agents of higher depth (according to the tree network). Our study shows that without using any knowledge about the network structure, such energy distributions cannot be achieved in a timely manner, which means that there might be high energy loss during the redistribution process. On the other hand, only a few extra bits of information seem to be enough to guarantee quick convergence to energy distributions that satisfy particular properties, yielding low energy loss.},

	abstract     = {With the large increases in video content, mobile network operators (MNOs) are persistently seeking to lower their content access latency and backhaul traffic. To mitigate these challenges, operators have started developing an operator-owned content caching system. However, in such networks, it is difficult to provide cost-effective and reliable cache performance for dynamically changing traffic using traditional proprietary network equipment. Meanwhile, network function virtualization (NFV) technology has become a key enabler in providing new business models with reduced costs and enhanced service agility to mobile networks. In addition, dynamic scaling of virtualized network functions can be used to leverage adaptable management of network services on the fly. In this study, we introduce a system architecture of MNO-driven virtualized caching-service based on an NFV standard platform that uses an integer linear programming (ILP)-based centralized optimization algorithm. Our proposed system employs mainly two techniques: a hierarchical caching model and a hybrid (centralized and distributed) orchestration scheme to optimize cache function with fine-grained control. Through experiments, we show that the conceptual MNO caching service is an effective strategy for reducing the traffic burden and enhancing the quality of service (QoS) for streaming video.},

In this paper, we argue that, joint access-backhaul mechanisms is becoming necessary to ensure the best use of the scarce resources. We introduce the problem of statically assigning resources to capacity-limited backhaul links and we provide preliminary results to show the potential benefits of an intelligent access-aware backhaul capacity optimization scheme, where a central controller optimizes backhaul capacity according to corresponding access network requirements. Simulation results show that, with this approach, we are able to carry more traffic in a network limited by its backhaul capacity.},

	abstract     = {Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is a network architecture that aims at providing high flexibility through the decoupling of the network logic from the forwarding functions. The ease of programmability makes SDN a great platform implementation of various initiatives that involve application deployment, security solutions, and decentralized network management in a multi-tenant data center environment. Although this can introduce many applications in different areas and leads to the high impact on several aspects, security of SDN architecture remains an open question and needs to be revisited based on the new concept of SDN. Current SDN-based attack detection mechanisms have some limitations. In this paper, we investigate two of those limitations: Misbehavior Attack and NewFlow Attack. We propose a secure system that periodically collects network statistics from the forwarding elements and apply Machine Learning (ML) classification algorithms. Our framework ensures that the proposed solution makes the SDN architecture more self-adaptive, and intelligent while reacting to network changes.},

	abstract     = {The next generation of mobile network communication systems will require from Internet Service Providers (ISP) the deployment of innovative and sophisticated Quality of Service (QoS) strategies to improve users perceived Quality of Experience (QoE). Many of the currently available QoS strategies are based on the Policy-based Network Management (PBNM) approach, commonly deployed in ISPs, which manages network resources according to users Service Level Agreement (SLA) To achieve efficiency, flexibility and scalability, the Software-Defined Mobile Networking (SDMN) paradigm enables a framework for deploying new resource management strategies such as the class-based over-provisioning model. However, especially in the mobile multimedia application scenario, the admission control operation may become ineffective when dealing with congestion situations since current streaming services do not provide an efficient way to control its transmission rate. This limitation is mainly caused by the rate adaptation engine which depends on user-side implementations, leading to unfair resource sharing. Traditional rate adjustment mechanisms also may impact on less capable mobile devices due to processing overheads, such as smartphones and IoT-enabled (Internet of Things) devices. In this scope, this work proposes the Dynamic Bit Rate Streaming Service over SDMN (DBR3S), an SDMN-based framework which enables PBNM resource management and a rate adaptation model based on network availability measurements carried out by an optimized control plane and enforced on the multimedia server through a cooperation system. The assessments demonstrate the feasibility of the DBR3S system, improving substantially the mobile users QoE over traditional streaming services.},

	abstract     = {The state of a meeting room (or of a classroom) provides important context to the level of interest (or participation level) in a meeting. For example, in one uninteresting meeting only one presenter presents text-filled slides, while other attendees are either checking their emails or even napping. In contrast, during a very interesting talk, all attendees are excited by the presentation and are involved in the discussions with frequent hand clapping. Thus, automatically detecting the state of a meeting room (or of a classroom) is an important and interesting problem. In this paper, we make the observation that the aforementioned group behaviors will have different motion signatures, as captured by a present Wi-Fi signal. Consequently, in this paper, we present a meeting room state detection approach leveraging environmental Wi-Fi signature. The Wi-Fi signal is provided by the existing access point (AP) in the meeting room and it is captured by one any Wi-Fi enabled device. The existing infrastructure provides all the information needed and no extra devices are needed. In our solution, different features are extracted from the raw Wi-Fi Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) signal and four popular machine learning algorithms (e.g. support vector machine (SVM), decision tree, nearest neighbor and naive Bayes networks) are evaluated for detecting the state of a meeting room. Our approach is evaluated for two scenarios: classroom state detection and meeting room state detection. The experimental results show an accuracy of our proposed solution of 90.7% and 94.1% for classroom state detection and meeting/lab room state detection, respectively.},

Then, we use a Bayesian formulation to determine the coefficients of the packet loss model using empirical observations from our testbed. We develop a new sequential Monte-Carlo algorithm that uses our packet count model. The algorithm is general enough to accommodate different spatial configurations. We have good indoor localization experiments: our approach has an average error of ~ 1.2m, 53% lower than the baseline range-free Monte-Carlo localization algorithm.},

We argue that the FLEX-MONROE platform is crucial to understand, validate and ultimately improve how current operational MBB networks perform, towards providing guidelines for designing future 5G architectures. Furthermore, understanding the effects of low-level tweaks in network parameters in the LTE infrastructure on the application performance is critical to provide guidelines on how to improve the application performance in the current but also future MBB networks.},

To enable researchers' access to lower-layer frame processing and advanced physical-layer functionalities on Broadcom Wi-Fi chips, we developed the Nexmon firmware patching framework. It allows users to create firmware modifications for embedded ARM processors using C code and to change the behavior of Broadcom's real-time processor using Assembly. Currently, our framework supports five Broadcom chips available in smartphones and Raspberry Pis. Our example patches enable monitor mode, frame injection, handling of ioctls, ucode compression and flashpatches. In a simple ping offloading example, we demonstrate how handling pings in firmware reduces power consumption by up to 165 mW and is nine times faster than in the kernel on a Nexus 5.

Indeed, with the sheer amount of data collected from 12 commercial mobile operators across Europe, MONROE offers an unprecedented opportunity to monitor, analyze and ultimately improve the status of current and future mobile broadband networks. We also show how flexibly the platform allows combining metadata and experimental data series during the experiments or by means of post-processing, and show results produced by our own experiments as well as by external research groups and developers that have been granted access to the platform.},

As the communications contexts for LTE expand, new research problems arise and include operation in harsh RF signaling environments and coexistence with other radios. Our testbed provides an integrated research tool for investigating these and other research problems; it allows analyzing the severity of the problem, designing and rapidly prototyping solutions, and assessing them with standard-compliant equipment and test procedures. The modular testbed integrates general-purpose software-defined radio hardware, LTE-specific test equipment, RF components, free open-source and commercial LTE software, a configurable RF network and recorded radar waveform samples. It supports RF channel emulated and over-the-air radiated modes. The testbed can be remotely accessed and configured. An RF switching network allows for designing many different experiments that can involve a variety of real and virtual radios with support for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna operation. We present the testbed, the research it has enabled and some valuable lessons that we learned and that may help designing, developing, and operating future wireless testbeds.},

Evaluating the performance of vehicular communication systems in real-world settings benefits from detailed propagation models. Developing such models can be challenging due to the dynamic nature of the vehicular environment. This paper presents an experimental methodology to control and monitor key experimental factors and to efficiently conduct real-world measurements. We tested the Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) technology at 5.9 GHz in a week-long experiment involving 10 vehicles on a major highway under one of the most dense traffic conditions in the United States. We study the repeatability of such measurements for different experiment durations, which may help place earlier propagation studies into context. The experiments show that, with orchestrated vehicle movement in a 2 km section of highway, the pathloss exponent estimation is repeatable within a tolerance of +/-0.1 in 11 minutes of measurements for extremely light traffic and in 48 minutes for moderate to heavy traffic.},

This paper introduces a system that can identify the material type with cheap commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) RFID devices. The key intuition is that different materials cause different amounts of phase and RSS (Received Signal Strength) changes when radio frequency (RF) signal penetrates through the target. However, without knowing either material type, trying to obtain the information is challenging. We propose a method to address this challenge and evaluate the method's performance in real-world environment. The results show that we achieve higher than 94% material identification accuracies for 10 liquids and differentiate even very similar objects such as Coke and Pepsi.},

Leveraging the testbed's capabilities, we conduct an extensive measurement study, looking at different aspects of indoor 60 GHz links. We find that the presence of reflective surfaces and imperfect beams generated by practical phased arrays together can result in multiple NLoS paths supporting Gbps rates. Additionally, our comparison of different beam adaptation strategies reveals how beam steering even at one end of the link can often be sufficient to restore link quality.},

The main success factors are the very affordable price ($25 USD), ease of use and wide availability of open-source SDR software. One important performance aspect of SDR receivers is related to the accuracy and stability of the Local Oscillator (LO). We present LTESS-track, an LO frequency offset evaluation method that relies on the Synchronization Signals (SS) transmitted by LTE base stations as reference. We compare LTESS-track with other publicly available tools for frequency offset estimation and show that our method can perform reliable measurements in less than 1 second, orders of magnitude faster than software publicly available. We leverage LTESS-track to assess the actual LO performances of two popular RTL-SDR models with and without Temperature Controlled Local Oscillator (TCXO). The experimental results show that the latest generation of RTL-SDR (with TCXO), despite being very low cost, has surprising excellent LO stability, well within the maximum tolerance of 1 ppm declared in the specifications.},

This makes them perfect candidates for large-scale wireless testbeds. To reduce energy consumption, those devices contain FullMAC Wi-Fi chips. They run proprietary firmwares that abstract from low-layer mechanisms on the data link (MAC) and physical layer (PHY). This hinders researchers to influence their operation and evaluate new communication schemes on off-the-shelf devices. Using our Nexmon firmware patching framework, we gain access to chip internals to extend their functionalities by writing patches comfortably in C. In this work, we use a Raspberry Pi 3 to offer workshop attendees a hands-on experience on how to get starting with Nexmon by extending the firmware of the Pi's Wi-Fi chip. Additionally, we use Android smartphones to present our wireless penetration testing app based on monitor mode and frame injection patches, as well as our reactive Wi-Fi jamming app based on patches to the Wi-Fi chip's real-time processor. The demonstrations show how easily Nexmon enables us to implement even complex applications in a Wi-Fi chip resulting in very low processing latencies and low energy consumption.

One such approach is via Multipath TCP (MPTCP), a transport layer protocol that is transparent to applications and requires no changes to the underlying wireless drivers. However, MPTCP (as well as other bundling approaches) have only been evaluated to date in 60 GHz WLANs with laptop clients.In this work, we port for first time the MPTCP source code to a dual-band smartphone equipped with an 802.11ad and an 802.11ac radio. We discuss the challenges we face and the system-level optimizations required to enable the phone to support Gbps data rates and yield optimal MPTCP throughput (i.e., the sum of the individual throughputs of the two radios) under ideal conditions. We also evaluate for first time the power consumption of MPTCP in a dual-band 802.11ad/ac smartphone and provide recommendations towards the design of an energy-aware MPTCP scheduler. We make our source code publicly available to enable other researchers to experiment with MPTCP in smartphones equipped with millimeter wave radios.},

The framework was built on COSMOS, an advanced wireless testbed designed to support real-world experimentation of next generation wireless technologies and applications. Our deployed framework supports experimentation over a large number of wireless networks, with a PUB-SUB based network interaction structure, based on the Collaborative Intelligent Radio Networks (CIRN) Interaction Language (CIL) developed by DARPA for the Spectrum Collaboration Challenge (SC2). As such, it enables interaction and message exchanges between the networks for the purposes of coordinating spectrum use. For our experiment, the message exchanges are aimed primarily for, but not limited to, Spectrum Consumption Model (SCM) messages. RF devices/systems use SCM messages which contain detailed information about their wireless transmission characteristics (i.e., spectrum mask, frequency, bandwidth, power and location) to determine their operational compatibility (non-interference) with prior transmitters and receivers, and to dynamically determine spectrum use characteristics for their own transmissions.},

	abstract     = {Much like earlier "network softwarization" efforts, the Open RAN concept is poised to have a transformative impact on the manner in which radio access networks (RANs) are realized and operated. The inherent complexity of the RAN ecosystem and the fact that it is rapidly evolving makes Open RAN a rich area of research into use cases, system realization, security, and more. This same complexity, however, hampers research efforts. Specifically, there is a lack of end-to-end open source software and fully-developed use cases associated with the Open RAN ecosystem. Further, to truly advance the state of the art will require use cases to be explored in realistic wireless environments. This paper describes our efforts to address these shortcomings by realizing NexRAN, a top-to-bottom, open-source Open RAN use case in the POWDER mobile and wireless research platform. Specifically, NexRAN allows closed-loop control of a RAN slicing realization in an O-RAN ecosystem. RAN slicing is implemented in the srsRAN open source mobility stack and is exposed through a custom service model to the NexRAN xApp, which executes on a RAN intelligent controller (RIC) from the O-RAN Alliance. The NexRAN xApp realizes policy driven closed-loop control of RAN slices by reading the current state of RAN elements (using the O-RAN key performance measurements (KPM) service model) and controlling slice behavior via the custom slicing service model. We demonstrate and evaluate NexRAN in the POWDER platform and have open sourced all aspects of our realization to enable research into this domain.},

	abstract     = {Security vulnerabilities make the Internet of Things (IoT) systems open to online attacks that threaten both their operation and user privacy. Among the many protocols governing IoT operation, MQTT has seen wide adoption, but comes with rudimentary security support. Specifically, while the MQTT standard strongly recommends that servers (brokers) offer Transport Layer Security (TLS), it is mainly concerned with the message transmission protocol, leaving to implementers the responsibility for providing appropriate security features. However, well-known solutions for Web Security (OAuth2) exist, which may benefit MQTT. This paper presents systematic implementation efforts and practical experimentation to evaluate the feasibility of one such approach, namely the MQTT-TLS profile for the Authentication and Authorization in Constrained Environments (ACE), recently specified by the IETF. Our implementation includes the functionality for (1) the Authorization Server (AS), to handle client registration, authorization policies, and Access Tokens; (2) the MQTT broker, to enforce authentication in both MQTT versions 3.1.1 and 5. Together, these enable ACE-MQTT clients to use (3) OAuth2-based authentication and authorization via Proof of Possession tokens. We make the source-code of our ACE-MQTT implementation publicly available, and evaluate it against plain MQTT systems in realistic settings with different computation constraints. To assess the cost of security, we measure the CPU, memory, network usage, and energy consumption. The results obtained confirm that the ACE requirements match the capabilities of moderately constrained devices, hence providing an affordable mechanism to secure MQTT systems.},

At the same time, traditional 4G Long Term Evolution (LTE) deployments are being enhanced with the addition of bands in the unlicensed 5 GHz (using License Assisted Access, or LAA) and the 3.5 GHz Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) resulting in throughput performance comparable to 5G in mid-band. We present a detailed study comparing 4G and 5G deployments, in all bands in Chicago, and focused mmWave measurements and analysis in Miami. Our methodology, based on commercial and custom apps, is scalable for crowdsourcing measurements on a large scale and provides detailed data (throughput, latency, signal strength, etc.) on actual deployments. Our main conclusions based on the measurements are (i) optimized 4G networks in mid-band are comparable in both throughput and latency to current deployments of 5G (both standalone (SA) and non-standalone (NSA)) and (ii) mmWave 5G, even in NSA mode, can deliver multi-Gbps throughput reliably if the installation is dense enough, but performance is still brittle due to the propagation limitations imposed by distance and body-loss. Thus, while 5G demonstrates significant early promise, further work needs to be done to ensure that the stated goals of 5G are met.},

When integrating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) into cellular networks, their cell association needs to be carefully managed for coexistence with other cellular users. UAVs move in three dimensions and may traverse several cells on their flight path, and so may be subject to several handovers. In order to enable research on mobility management with UAV users, this paper describes the design, implementation, and testing methodology for handover experiments with aerial users. We leverage software-defined radios (SDRs) and implement a series of tools for preparing the experiment in the laboratory and for taking it outdoors for field testing. We use solely commercial off-the-shelf hardware, open-source software, and an experimental license to enable reproducible and scalable experiments. Our initial outdoor results with two SDR base stations connected to an open-source software core network, implementing the 4G long-term evolution protocol, and one low altitude UAV user equipment demonstrate the handover process.},

	abstract     = {Extensive use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is expected to raise privacy and security concerns among individuals and communities. In this context, detection and localization of UAVs will be critical for maintaining safe and secure airspace in the future. In this work, Keysight N6854A radio frequency (RF) sensors are used to detect and locate a UAV by passively monitoring the signals emitted from the UAV. First, the Keysight sensor detects the UAV by comparing the received RF signature with various other UAVs' RF signatures in the Keysight database using an envelope detection algorithm. Afterward, time difference of arrival (TDoA) based localization is performed by a central controller using the sensor data, and the drone is localized with some error. To mitigate the localization error, implementing an extended Kalman filter (EKF) is proposed in this study. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated on a realistic experimental dataset. EKF requires basic assumptions on the type of motion throughout the trajectory, i.e., the movement of the object is assumed to fit some motion model (MM) such as constant velocity (CV), constant acceleration (CA), and constant turn (CT). In the experiments, an arbitrary trajectory is followed, therefore it is not feasible to fit the whole trajectory into a single MM. Consequently, the trajectory is segmented into sub-parts and a different MM is assumed in each segment while building the EKF model. Simulation results demonstrate an improvement in error statistics when EKF is used if the MM assumption aligns with the real motion.},

Given that the CSI can accurately mirror physical changes in the wireless channel, CSI analysis has become a valuable resource to many wireless sensing applications based on the opportunistic use of Wi-Fi signals. Since CSI can usually not be accessed by users directly, several CSI extraction tools have been published over the last few years for various Wi-Fi chipsets. In this paper, we present the first system ever capable of extracting CSI from 802.11ax consumer devices using the Broadcom 43684 Wi-Fi chipset. This platform can extract up to 160 MHz-wide CSI using 4x4 MIMO, and it is compatible with the latest HE PHY.

	abstract     = {As evolving wireless network architectures become more diverse, complex, and interdependent, and equipment costs prohibit broad access to such networks, remotely accessible experimental testbeds are gaining interest in recent years in wireless communication and networking research. This interest has exacerbated in 2020 and became a vital need during the current global pandemic. However, providing end-users of various educational backgrounds access to radio devices from a heterogeneous set of vendors is challenging. This paper introduces OneLNK, a remotely accessible testbed consisting of radio devices from three different vendors and developed using open source cloud-native technologies. End-users can access the functionalities of OneLNK from a single webpage without any local installations. Using the web URL, users can operate radio devices, set experiment parameters, observe results in real-time, and save generated experiment data for all radio devices. The interactive web UI and its working mechanism for supporting radio equipment are covered with specific experiment capabilities. A diverse set of radio equipment (mmWave, sub-GHz SDR, and sub-6GHz SDR) are facilitated to explain these capabilities. Moreover, measurements of path loss, Received Signal Strength (RSS), and Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) using devices from three different vendors operating on a vast spectrum (568 MHz, 5.8 GHz, and 60 GHz) are reported. The majority of the remotely accessible OneLNK platform was developed remotely during the pandemic by a team of experts from five U.S. states.},

This has led to severe demand-supply imbalances causing grid instability and reliability issues. Towards this end, Demand Reponse (DR) management has been identified as an important means to tackle this problem. Thus, in this paper, a robust Stackelberg Game has been proposed wherein the Utility Provider (UP) and fleet of EVs are assumed to be playing the roles of a competitive leader and followers, respectively. In the considered game, EVs charging problem has been formulated as a non-cooperative game; in which EVs decide their charging slot in accordance with the real-time electricity prices announced by the UP. The existence and uniqueness of the formulated Stackelberg Game has been theoretically proved in the paper. Further, the efficacy of the formulated game has been validated on real-time data traces obtained from Haryana State Electricity Board, India.},

Consequently, not only human effort, but chances of errors are also reduced. Moreover, once an intended state is achieved, IBN ensures that it is maintained unless a user requests otherwise. In this paper, we present an industrial perspective of IBN. In particular, we identify several use cases in the context of industrial networks that can potentially benefit from IBN. Subsequently, we propose an architecture of IBN, and elaborate how the different use cases can be realized using it. In addition, we present a case study on the use of intents with a widely used framework. Although, there still are a few challenges along the IBN way, when addressed, IBN can bring down an organization's expenses while improving its efficiency and reliability at the same time.},

	abstract     = {Industrial Wireless Sensor Networks (IWSNs) are an extension of the Internet of Things paradigm that integrates smart sensors in industrial processes. However, the unattended open environment makes IWSNs vulnerable to malicious attacks, such as node compromise in addition to eavesdropping. The compromised nodes can again launch notorious attacks such as the sinkhole or sybil attack which may degrade the network performance. In this paper, we propose a lightweight, Secure Directed Diffusion (SDD) protocol. The algorithm for the proposed protocol uses bilinear pairing to derive a location-based key (LK) by binding the ID and geographic location of a node, thereby ensuring neighborhood authentication. Thus, authenticated nodes can prevent eavesdropping, node compromise including sinkhole and sybil attacks while ensuring confidentiality, authenticity, integrity with reduced latency. Finally, through security analysis, we prove that basic security is maintained and above-mentioned attacks are also prevented. We also compute storage, computation and communication overheads which show that SDD performs at least 2.6 times better in terms of storage overhead and at least 1.3 times better in terms of communication overhead over the other state-of-the-art competing schemes for attack preventions in WSN domain.},

	abstract     = {Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of physical devices which are accessible through the Internet. All the devices are assigned with an IP address and are competent enough to collect data and provide some services. The installed technology and software used in all these smart items help them to interact with the end-user(s). Thus the IoT network becomes more vulnerable to attacks by external entities. Consequently, it is required to check the leakage of any information during message transmission in the network. Message injection, relay attacks, and side channel attacks by a malicious node can result in privacy loss and security hacks. Service-Oriented Architecture help vendors provide services to the consumer over a network following some protocols. In this paper we have implemented a security scheme that can be suitable for Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) based IoT network. The proposed scheme allows to transfer data in a network only if the public key (encrypted hop-count) received by the packet matches with the public key(decrypted hop-count) between the source and destination node stored in the routing table. Otherwise, the data is considered to be malicious and discarded from the network. A non-cooperative Stackelberg game based mathematical model is presented, which considers defenders as leaders and attackers as followers. We have simulated our proposed scheme and have compared it with the existing security and authentication scheme, UAKMP, in identical conditions. From the analysis of the results we evaluate that, SecureIoT has improved performance with reduced communication overheads.},

The theory is corroborated by its performance in terms of probability of detection and probability of false alarm.

And well before that, the serial fieldbuses made their entrance into industrial systems, and these installations are to a large extent still in use. The ongoing development of Ethernet TSN (Time Sensitive Networks) and 5G (the next generation telecommunication standard), supported by technologies like AI (Artificial Intelligence) will be the third major evolution phase for industrial communication, and it will highly impact the future industrial communication the next years to come. In this talk I will analyze the applications that can make benefit of TSN and 5G, and what the main challenges are to reach them. The talk will also address what we should learn from the two previous evolution phases and how that will influence the future connectivity research and development. Additionally, the traditional industries no longer develop everything on their own as they used to do, the development speed and business climate instead emphasize collaborations with partners, academia and startup companies. Some examples on how this can be accomplished will also be presented.},

The conventional EA relays are simple low-end stand-alone devices without any data processing and communication capabilities. However, with the effect of digitalization and internet of things, the market trend is towards integrating the plant information with innovative, data-based services. Therefore, the low-end EA relays need to be augmented with smart, light weight communication solution along with the necessary edge computing which can cater to the digitalization requirement. The challenge lies is in providing light weight smart solution for EA relays without major hardware upgrade. The EA relays with the communication module need to be configured appropriately so that they become a part of Substation Automation System. Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs) in the Substation Automation Network are configured as per the IEC 61850-6 standard and configuring these IEDs is an effort consuming job. EA relays with the communication module possess very limited functionality and auto configuration for such modules is of high importance in order to minimize engineering efforts. This paper also describes the auto configuration methodology for the communication module when the module is connected to the Substation Automation Network and each of EA relays are represented uniquely and appropriately in the remote digital platform.},

While it is still easier to identify the road, the rapid change in the traffic makes it difficult to safely carry out automatic lane change in real-time. This work proposes a mechanism by first modeling the behavior of vehicles in a dynamic environment by generating fusion data from various externally mounted sensors, RADAR and cameras and then develop a visual perception of the same using multi-object tracker and tracking Kalman filter.},

While a fully autonomous car system is still to happen commercially, significant advancements have been made in the world of connected vehicles. Connected vehicles imply vehicles that are not only connected to the Internet/ outside world but also that are connected to each other. The ability of vehicles to communicate both critical and non-critical information with its immediate neighbors provides each vehicle the platform for understanding its environment. Particularly, the connected cars would enable each vehicle to develop driver enhancement systems in order to improve/enhance its driving in terms of automatic lane change, taking turns, etc.In addition, a significant aspect of connected cars that have taken lot of importance is the vehicle platooning. A platoon is a group of vehicles that can travel very closely together, safely, at high speed using connectivity technology and automated driving support systems. These vehicles automatically maintain a set, close distance between each other when they are connected for certain parts of a journey, for instance on motorway. There is a lead vehicle that controls the speed and direction, and all following vehicles respond to the lead vehicle's movement. A platooning system holds great potential to make road transport safer, cleaner and more efficient in the future. Also, it optimizes transport by using roads more effectively, delivering goods faster and reducing traffic jams. Though in the initial stages, each connected vehicle would have a driver at all times, but eventually driverless vehicles will be able to automatically join the other connected cars that may function like long trains of vehicles on a highway.}

The bit error rate (BER) variation over a day has been compared for both the cities for the month of March, June and December. It has been shown that for a given BER threshold performance, the impact of solar irradiance is more pronounced in month of June especially at New Delhi when solar irradiance reaches its peak. It has also been shown that in month of December, fog is one of the most significant climatic factors that greatly influences the VLC based C2C communication in terms of atmospheric attenuation. This paper also establishes the relationship for the minimum safety distance required between cars based on two-second rule, car speed and angle between cars. The minimum safety distance which would be required to avoid any rear-end collision especially during light or dense fog in the month of December has also been compared for New Delhi and London.},

The performance of the CACC based platoon highly depends upon the maneuver performed by its leader vehicle because its actions have a direct implication on follower vehicles in the platoon. The leader vehicle plays a significant role in intra-platoon coordination, synchronization, collision avoidance and path planning. Thus, an election of the most appropriate, trusted and best entity to take the role of a leader in a CACC platooning becomes crucial. For efficient and safe functionality of this system, leader election has to be fair to every vehicle and should assign leader with the consensus of the whole platoon. To this end, very few contributions are available. In this paper, we suggest an incentive strategy and propose an architecture and leader election mechanism to elect the best leader of the platoon efficiently.},

	abstract     = {As one move towards driverless cars, there will always be a big worry of how autonomous cars would behave in the presence of vehicles driven by humans. In the co-existence model, it is essential for autonomous systems to 'understand' the behavior and gazing patterns of the drivers across different road turns and traffic lights. It is essential to understand that each road turn in a city is different due to angle of turn, building environment, etc. Hence, one needs to understand the gaze patterns of drivers across different turns and traffic lights. This paper is a long-drawn effort for measuring driver's observability and deriving driver's observance pattern in real-time. In this regard, an experimental model is provided and clustering-based technique is applied that would measure driver observability. More than 100 segmented readings were extracted from the video of five different vehicles and drivers under two different road conditions. It was observed that - while taking left or right turns and waiting in traffic light, the focus of drivers in front of their cars also changes considerably, with significant variation in the driver's gaze point, both horizontally and vertically. This is a important pattern/result in the design of adaptive driver assistance system and future driverless cars.},

SDN is used to centralize network control by performing routing calculation and transmission range adaptation to improve the number of interconnected cars. NDN is used as the communication mechanism since a vehicle is not interested in where the content is located, but rather in what the content is. For improving communication we install multiple antennas in vehicles and Road Side Units along streets and study the impact on communication according to the number of installed antennas. Finally, SDN deployment allows us to use unicast transmissions for content retrieval. Our results show that the SDN controller is responsible for routing 5%-10% of the total requests existing in the vehicular network.},

	abstract     = {Multi-SIM capable mobile phones have been gaining popularity. Due to the absence of standardized solution, there are implementation variations in the User Equipment (UE) from both hardware and software perspectives. Especially, coordination of call events on multiple SIMs requires standardization as it involves interaction between the Core Network (CN) and the UE to avoid negative user experience such as missed incoming call or interrupted data session. 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has an ongoing work to addresses this area in Release 17. However, security aspects are outside the scope, including mechanisms to verify multiple SIMs in a device. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing variations of verification schemes using crypgographic operations to help mobile networks to identify the device capability of the UE and verify multiple SIMs in it. The proposed mechanisms are simple and effective to meet the goal. Based on our investigation, we believe this is the first proposal to address this aspect in the multi-SIM devices in the mobile system.},

	abstract     = {New applications such as remote surgery and connected cars, which are being touted as use cases for 5G and beyond, are mission-critical. As such, communications infrastructure needs to support and enforce stringent and guaranteed levels of service before such applications can take off. However, from an operator's perspective, it can be difficult to provide uniformly high levels of service over long durations or large regions. As network conditions change over time, or when a mobile end point goes to regions with poor coverage, it may be difficult for the operator to support previously agreed upon service agreements that are too stringent. Second, from a consumer's perspective, purchasing a stringent service level agreement with an operator can also be expensive. Finally, failures in mission critical applications can lead to disasters, so infrastructure should support assignment of liabilities when a guaranteed service level is reneged upon - this is a difficult problem because both the operator and the customer have an incentive to lay the blame on each other to avoid liabilities of poor service.To address the above problems, we propose AJIT, an architecture that allows creating fine-grained short-term contracts between operator and consumer. AJIT uses smart contracts to allow dynamically changing service levels so that more expensive and stringent levels of service need only be requested by a customer for short durations when the application needs it, and operator agrees to the SLA only when the infrastructure is able to support the demand. Second, AJIT uses trusted enclaves to do the accounting of packet deliveries such that neither the customer requesting guaranteed service levels for mission-critical applications, nor the operator providing the infrastructure support, can cheat.},

	abstract     = {Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) are expected to play a vital role in increasing road safety and road efficiency in the near future. The primary feature of ITS applications is to provide road safety, which is based on IEEE-802.11p technology, by transmitting safety messages to the vehicles in the surrounding. The channel congestion is a significant challenge for the IEEE802.11p, ITS is operating on. Congestion increases the data loss and degrades the ITS performance resulting from compromising passengers safety. In this paper, we analyze the benefits of exploiting vehicle's embedded sensors to enhance car perception and hence improve the efficiency of cooperative communications. To this purpose, we implemented the collaborative environment perception approach for vehicular safety applications proposed by [1] and analyze its performance and behavior in congested urban traffic. In this proposal, so-called ECAM (Extended Cooperative Awareness Message), vehicles use a different type of sensors (cameras, radars, lidars etc.) to collect the status information of the surrounding vehicles in their detection range and share this information through a collaborative beaconing scheme to reduce congestion on the communication channel. This scheme implements a dual step mechanism to function. The first phase implements the collaborative perception mechanism by adding the locally collected information in the safety message and sharing this up to date data to intensify the awareness among the vehicles in its communication surrounding. In the second phase, the recipient vehicles verify the accuracy of the information received from the collective perception enabled vehicles by leveraging the position by adding an error threshold. Performance evaluation conducted through extensive simulations shows the benefits of exploiting increased perception to enhance awareness among cars while reducing the contention on the wireless interface.},

However, spatio-temporal variations of the mm-wave channel impose significant challenges for high rate error-free communication, due to increased propagation loss and blockage susceptibility. In this paper, we analyze the end-to-end mobile user performance and the extent of mobility management overhead in the presence of dynamic pedestrian blockages. We use site-specific propagation data obtained via high resolution ray-tracing and realistic pedestrian traffic to implement site-specific user mobility and pedestrian blockage models, and integrate these in an extensive ns-3 framework to study the end-to-end mobile user performance. Our results show that the number of mm-wave mobility management events -- beam tracking, beam steering and handover -- strongly depends on the pedestrian walk nature and number of blockage events, i.e. the primary mm-wave serving link can be blocked for up to 36% of a walk duration. These frequent short-term pedestrian blockages can lead to TCP throughput degradation of up to 35% and TCP round-trip-time spikes of over 1 s, compared to the achievable network performance when pedestrian blockages are not considered, assuming mobility management with up-to-date CSI. We also show that stale CSI -- arising from delay in periodic beam training procedures -- results in more frequent and sub-optimal mobility management decisions and an additional TCP throughput degradation of up to 30%, compared to the achievable TCP throughput assuming mobility management with up-to-date CSI.},

In this paper, we introduce an approach to represent the visual context within a video as queryable information. Through the use of computer vision techniques, we can detect and classify objects. Our system processes these classifications in order to construct a queryable data-set referred to as the real world model. The advantage of this approach is that through the formalisation of the information, we can create generic queries to retrieve information. This approach allows for processing to be done on edge devices such as embedded cameras while only transmitting detected information reducing the transmission bandwidth as well as infrastructural costs. The final recognition data is processed on the cloud. The analysed case study works on video traffic representation - an experiment around the transport domain. We evaluate and validate our approach by posing several queries to the system that generates information on the traffic situation, such as car counting and traffic flow. The results show that our approach can add context to classifications with a high degree of accuracy in some of the cases, achieving 95% car counting accuracy during the day. Fine tuning approaches are also discussed with reference to the video traffic representation case while keeping to the same proposed methodology.},

	abstract     = {The growing popularity of connected vehicles is driving the development of a new class of latency-sensitive applications. The applications can benefit from edge clouds but they need timely responses to their requests. For applications based on video and other sensor data, this necessitates high burst throughput from the network, which results in a challenging scheduling problem since applications have diverse request sizes, rates, and deadlines. While the problem of managing latency sensitive bursty traffic has been considered in data centers, wireless networks use variable bit rates, which further exacerbates the problem.In this paper, we first use simple examples to show that traditional network fairness and quality-of-service (QoS) solutions are not appropriate for latency sensitive applications using cloud services at the wireless edge. We then sketch a possible solution that addresses the challenges of combining Service Level Agreements that focus on burst transfers with a network scheduler that is resource-aware. Finally, we use a simplified network, namely Wi-Fi based emulation, to show how our approach enables both the network administrator and applications to meet their goals.},

	abstract     = {In modern society, vehicles have become an indispensable means of transportation to ensure people's travel and the circulation of social production materials and living materials. However, while bringing us convenience in life, with the increasing number of vehicles, the corresponding energy consumption and exhaust emission problems have also caused a lot of social wealth loss. Therefore, how to effectively improve the energy efficiency of vehicles to achieve the goal of energy-saving and emission reduction is one of the focuses of current academic and industrial circles. Different from the industrial sector, which mainly achieves energy saving and emission reduction by improving the mechanical performance of vehicles [such as increasing the thermal efficiency of internal combustion engines (ICEs)] or introducing new energy vehicles (such as electric vehicles), we have more choices in the academic world. Among them, through effective traffic signal control, the energy consumption of the vehicle can be improved by achieving a uniform speed of the vehicle as much as possible. We believe that the advantage of this method is that it can improve the energy efficiency of the vehicle within the system without updating the vehicle. In this article, we will prove this assertion and compare some state-of-the-art approaches through the form of an empirical study.},

	abstract     = {Followed by the destruction of existing infrastructure or the emergence of the necessity for a new infrastructure, disaster events (e.g., earthquakes and pandemic) may require inspection of certain area and passing information to a dedicated help unit. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-aided mobile relaying technology is one of the effective means of provisioning service in such situations. In this paper, as the part of the rescuing operation in a certain disaster spot, we consider a mobile relaying technique, where an UAV acts as a relay node to ferry data between two disconnected floating or fixed nodes. For the sake of simplicity and low cost, amplify-and-forward relaying capability is adopted for the UAV. We consider the maximization of end-to-end throughput of such a system by optimizing the source/UAV power allocation as well as the trajectory of the UAV while considering practical mobility constraints (on the speed and initial/final locations of the UAV) as well as signal causality constraints. The formulated optimization problem is non-convex, and hence intractable to solve. Therefore, similar to the existing solution approach, we solve the problem via an iteration-based solution strategy, however we solve the source/UAV power allocation and the UAV trajectory design problems per iteration in a different manner. For the source/UAV power allocation problem, we provide heuristic solutions while considering both the availability and absence of a buffer at the UAV node. On the other hand, for the given power assignment, we adopt the geometric programming (GP)-based approach upon the transformation of variables and constraints. Furthermore, under the free initial and final UAV locations, jointly optimal power allocation and UAV trajectory are derived. Through extensive simulation, we verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme while comparing with one existing work.},

Compared to the existing methods that require user involvement, such as downloading an application and turning on Bluetooth, Vecsim is easier to deploy and may cover a larger population. Vecsim protects user privacy by focusing on user proximity detection, which is different from localization. In addition, proximity detection is a much easier problem than localization and can achieve higher accuracy. The key novelties of Vecsim include a simple method for distance estimation based on the similarity of two data records, as well as exploiting the massive log data to learn the discontinuity of the signal field. Vecsim has been tested with the signal field generated by a commercial ray tracing software program in a 2 km by 2 km urban area. The results show that Vecsim alerts over 96% of cellphones within 50 m to each other, while alerting less than 4.5% of cellphones beyond 150 meters.},

	abstract     = {Integrity of location data from smart-phones is essential in several location-dependent applications. Unfortunately it is quite easy to spoof location data on smart phones. Therefore, most mission critical services such as road-side assistance, use location aggregators to supply verified location with user permission. This verified location is purchased from cellular carriers and user permission is required to comply with governmental privacy laws. However, cellular carriers, not aggregators are bound by privacy regulation. Therefore, when there is a breach of confidentiality, as it happened recently in the US, it is the cellular carriers' who were held responsible and must take corrective actions. In this paper, we present a mechanism to obtain location certificates using LTE positioning protocols so that it is possible for cellular carriers to (a) obtain verifiable consent from the mobile user before their location is released, (b) be able to directly provide verified location as a service to businesses rather than selling customer data to third party location aggregators, and (c) enable mobile users to store self-certifiable proofs of their own location to reuse as needed. With this mechanism in place, people can have greater control over their privacy as location-dependent services are assured of integrity.},

We propose a system which combines sensor data from autonomous vehicles and IoT data collected from pedestrians' mobile devices. Our approach includes two methods for vulnerable road user (VRU) detection and pedestrian movement intention prediction, and a model to combine the two outputs for potentially improving the autonomous decision-making. The first method creates a world model (WM) and accurately localizes VRUs using in-vehicle cameras and external mobile device data. The second method is a deep learning model to predict pedestrian's next movement steps using real-time trajectory and training with historical mobile device data. To test the system, we conduct three pilot tests at a university campus with a custom-built autonomous car and mobile devices carried by pedestrians. The results from our controlled experiments show that VRU detection can more accurately distinguish locations of pedestrians using IoT data. Furthermore, up to five future steps of pedestrians can be predicted within 2 m.},

In this paper, we introduce the NEAT transport architecture as a solution to this problem. NEAT is designed to offer a flexible and evolvable transport system, where applications communicate their transport-service requirements to the NEAT system in a generic, transport-protocol independent way. The best transport option is then configured at run-time based on application requirements, network conditions, and available transport options. Through a set of real life mobile use case experiments, we demonstrate how applications with different properties and requirements could employ the NEAT system in multi-access environments, showing significant performance benefits as a result.},

However, the common approach of plugging âvanillaâ AI models into controllers and orchestrators does not fulfil the potential of the technology. Instead, AI models should be tailored to the specific network level and respond to the specific needs of network functions, eventually coordinated by an end-to-end NI-native architecture for 6G.

To mitigate RPP we propose a mechanism called Auxiliary Forwarding Set (AFS). AFS takes several mobility factors as inputs and extends the NDN core philosophy by identifying an extra set of eligible nodes to forward Data messages whenever retransmissions are required due to RPP. Simulation results show that AFS is an efficient and scalable solution to improve VNDN application performance regardless of receiver mobility.},

In order to provide a high throughput to aircraft, an air-to-ground network combining direct air-to-ground, satellite and air-to-air connectivity is needed. To provide a fair throughput allocation to aircraft, we define a 5G-based air-to-ground architecture and introduce a heuristic algorithm to fairly distribute the capacity among aircraft. We evaluate the algorithm in an European scenario using real aircraft traces. We show that our algorithm can fairly distribute the throughput per aircraft. During high-aircraft-density times, the maximum difference to the ideally distributed throughput is only 3.9%. Additionally, we introduce a weighted-fair allocation, corresponding to the aircraft size, to distribute the throughput according to the number of users per aircraft.},

This had led many researchers and scientists to analyze and study different factors and variables that obtain timely information on the outbreak of COVID-19. One of the main factors that helped in spreading the corona-virus is human mobility. Since detailed information about human movement during outbreaks are difficult to obtain, social networks comes as an alternative with its massive volume of publicly available data. In this research, we propose mobility detection and identification of social media's spatio-temporal data, as a proxy for human mobility. We aim to discover and explore an in-depth level of mobility data extracted from social media applications to uncover the relation between COVID-19 spread and daily mobility ratio in Kuwait regional area. With the use of the latest mobility data extracted from Twitter users, we have shown that user mobility is linked to the positive cases of COVID-19, with a relatively high correlation coefficient. Moreover, we have analyzed and discussed how the impact of COVID-19 affected user behavior and mobility habits.},

The UAVs are assumed as intelligent agents which can adaptively adjust their three dimensional (3D) deployment to maximize the channel capacity of the multiple input multiple output (MIMO) system. Specifically, for the limitations of each UAV in accessing the global information, we consider a decentralized control strategy and divide the optimization problem into several optimization sub-problems, and then formulated into a UAVs channel capacity game. We analyze such game according to the designed reward function and the potential function. Then, we discuss the existence of the pure Nash equilibrium in the game. To achieve the best Nash equilibrium of the MIMO system, we develop a decentralized learning algorithm, namely decentralized UAVs channel capacity learning. The details of the algorithm is provided and the convergence of the algorithm is analyzed. In the meanwhile, we give some insightful remarks. The simulations show that the developed learning algorithm can achieve a high channel capacity than the benchmark methods.},

Alternatively, when optimizing the cell edge performance, MU-MIMO, while also shown to be ineffective when used in isolation, is in fact very valuable when accompanied by a suitable configuration of D-MIMO. As an illustrative example, when using a jointly optimised configuration of D/MU-MIMO in a highly loaded urban deployment scenario, a 121% cell edge performance gain can be attained over a scenario using only D-MIMO, and even a demonstrated 153% gain over a scenario where only the MU-MIMO feature is available.},

Within this framework, we present a LOS prediction algorithm based on machine learning (ML) that addresses the LOS discovery problem. The algorithm relies on the available network state information (e.g., LOS connectivity between STAs and the AP) to predict the unknown LOS connectivity status between the reachable AP locations and target STAs. We show that the proposed algorithm can predict LOS connectivity between the AP and target STAs with an accuracy up to 91%. Based on the LOS prediction algorithm, we then propose a systematic solution WiMove, which can decide if and where the AP should move to for optimizing network performance. Using both ns-3 based simulation and experimental prototype implementation, we show that the throughput and fairness performance of WiMove is up to 119% and 15% better compared with single static AP and brute force search.},

The emergence of COVID-19 pandemic has made the modeling and simulation of community infection spread a vital activity in the battle against the disease. This paper provides insights for the utility of MCS to inform the decision support systems combating the pandemic. We present an MCS-driven community risk modeling solution against COVID-19 pandemic with the support of smart mobile device users (i.e., MCS participants), who opt-in to crowdsensing campaigns and grant access to their mobile device's built-in sensors (including GPS). Each community is defined by the spatio-temporal instances of MCS participants that are clustered based on the projected future movements of these participants. The MCS platform keeps track of the mobility patterns of the participants and utilizes unsupervised machine learning (ML) algorithms, more specifically k-means, Hidden Markov Model (HMM), and Expectation Maximization (EM) to predict a risk score of COVID-19 community spread for each community ahead of time. Through numerical results from simulating a metropolitan area (e.g., Paris), it is shown that communities? COVID-19 risk scores at the end of a set of MCS campaign can be predicted 20% ahead of time (i.e., upon completion of 80% of the MCS time commitments) with a dependability score up to 0.96 and an average of 0.93. Further tests with a larger population of participants show that community risk scores can be predicted 20% ahead of time with a dependability score up to 0.99 and an average of 0.98.},

An IoT scenario presupposes machines, objects or things are no longer in need of support, supervision, and assistance; however, some issues must be faced, such as communications delay, data synchronization, energy consumption and computing power. This work aims to efficiently and effectively use of network and devices resources. IoT must be independent of entities responsible for interact in cyber-physical systems. A lightweight messaging protocol, agnostic to content and payload, based on Publish/Subscribe technique optimizes network and devices resources and allows independence and autonomy. This work proposes, the use of lightweight Internet protocols to integrate a message broker and Publish/Subscribe messaging transport. The design was validated through firmware to less use of microcontroller from IoT devices. Consequently, logical operations and processed data were less. Finally, test scenario was implemented with major components of the Publish/Subscribe and the design is able to support RESTful architecture. Moreover, it demonstrated data transfer trough MQTT protocol improves: payload, bandwidth and power consumption compared with RESTful techniques. Finally, it offers a path to achieve critical requirements expect anywhere, anytime and improved capabilities to final users and businesses.

	abstract     = {Terahertz (THz) Band communication is envisioned as one of the leading technology to meet the exponentially growing data rate requirements of emerging and future wireless communication networks. Although prior works on THz channel measurement capture large scale fading effects, like free space path loss and atmospheric absorption, they do not show the overall effect on the received signal due to additional non-linearity from experimental hardware. In this work, we perform over the air experiments in ultra-broad THz bandwidth (10 GHz) that reveals that the received signal undergoes frequency selective fading due to hardware imperfections. This motivates us to utilize orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) in indoor short range ultra-broadband THz communication. To experimentally show its efficacy, we compute the coherence bandwidth of the system, which is less than the full bandwidth. We derive optimal parameters for OFDM for our hardware setup and perform over-the-air experiments to achieve 42 Gbps physical layer data rate over an effective bandwidth of 8.125 GHz.},

	abstract     = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) networks can provide a resilient communication infrastructure to enhance terrestrial networks in case of traffic spikes or disaster scenarios. However, to be able to do so, they need to be based on high-bandwidth wireless technologies for both radio access and backhaul. With this respect, the millimeter wave (mmWave) spectrum represents an enticing solution, since it provides large chunks of untapped spectrum that can enable ultra-high data-rates for aerial platforms. Aerial mmWave channels, however, experience characteristics that are significantly different from terrestrial deployments in the same frequency bands. As of today, mmWave aerial channels have not been extensively studied and modeled. Specifically, the combination of UAV micro-mobility (because of imprecisions in the control loop, and external factors including wind) and the highly directional mmWave transmissions require ad hoc models to accurately capture the performance of UAV deployments. To fill this gap, we propose an empirical propagation loss model for UAV-to-UAV communications at 60 GHz, based on an extensive aerial measurement campaign conducted with the Facebook Terragraph channel sounders. We compare it with 3GPP channel models and make the measurement dataset publicly available.},

The emergence of the need for ultra-low delays for haptic communications and control loops in self-driving cars and other sensor-based applications, has radically changed the requirements for layers above the physical layer.

	abstract     = {60 GHz millimeter-wave networking has emerged as the next frontier technology to provide multi-Gbps wireless connectivity. Recently proposed mmWave network standards, like 802.11ad, have spawned a new wave of applications such as wireless virtual reality and uncompressed miracast. However, due to ultra-high carrier frequency, the 60 GHz radios are extremely vulnerable to propagation loss and obstacle blockage. To combat the intrinsic signal attenuation, the use of highly directional phased-array antennas, with limited Field-of-view (FoV), makes the mmWave links extremely sensitive to user mobility and orientation change. Hence, achieving stable 60 GHz connectivity, even at room-level, becomes a nontrivial task. My research has been focusing on a series of techniques to address these challenges. These techniques leverage extraneous sensing information to facilitate the mmWave protocols, so as to provide room-scale coverage at multi-Gbps bit-rate. In this talk, I will first outline the impact of limited FoV of the 60 GHz radio under mobility, and then present a robust 60 GHz network architecture, in which multiple cooperating APs can complement others' blind spots and together form seamless coverage. I will then describe two design components: pose-assisted link predictor and pose-assisted spatial sharing. They leverage the pose information from mobile devices, and improve the 60 GHz network robustness under mobility through intelligent AP switching and beam selection. Finally, to account for the impact of reflections from close-by objects, I will introduce an environment sensing method, which fuses the pose information with the link quality measurement, to computationally discriminate the refection paths and model their impacts separately.},

In this paper, we report the development of a new testbed architecture for multi-beam MIMO communication and sensing at mmW frequencies. The testbed uses a novel lens array for multi-beamforming and data multiplexing.

This paper presents a comprehensive performance evaluation of TCP on top of mmWave cellular systems with mobility management, detailed modeling of the channel dynamics, and end-to-end network architectures. We show how an efficient mobility management scheme in a dense network deployment can dramatically improve the performance of TCP in terms of both throughput and latency in mobile scenarios with blocking. The study also reveals that, even with fast mobility management, TCP throughput is extremely sensitive to the end-to-end delay with implications on both core network and server location.},

	abstract     = {Accurate human activity recognition (HAR) is the key to enable emerging context-aware applications that require an understanding and identification of human behavior, e.g., monitoring disabled or elderly people who live alone. Traditionally, HAR has been implemented either through ambient sensors, e.g., cameras, or through wearable devices, e.g., a smartwatch, with an inertial measurement unit (IMU). The ambient sensing approach is typically more generalizable for different environments as this does not require every user to have a wearable device. However, utilizing a camera in privacy-sensitive areas such as a home may capture superfluous ambient information that a user may not feel comfortable sharing. Radars have been proposed as an alternative modality for coarse-grained activity recognition that captures a minimal subset of the ambient information using micro-Doppler spectrograms. However, training fine-grained, accurate activity classifiers is a challenge as low-cost millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar systems produce sparse and non-uniform point clouds. In this paper, we propose RadHAR, a framework that performs accurate HAR using sparse and non-uniform point clouds. RadHAR utilizes a sliding time window to accumulate point clouds from a mmWave radar and generate a voxelized representation that acts as input to our classifiers. We evaluate RadHAR using a low-cost, commercial, off-the-shelf radar to get sparse point clouds which are less visually compromising. We evaluate and demonstrate our system on a collected human activity dataset with 5 different activities. We compare the accuracy of various classifiers on the dataset and find that the best performing deep learning classifier achieves an accuracy of 90.47%. Our evaluation shows the efficacy of using mmWave radar for accurate HAR detection and we enumerate future research directions in this space.},

In prior cellular generations, the development of communications and networking algorithms was significantly aided by software defined radio based experimentation. Similarly, we believe that the challenges of this new era will require the development of algorithms based on experimentation using software defined millimeter wave multi-antenna systems.

Phase and gain of each element can be controlled, with support for up to 8 simultaneous beams. Key circuit and antenna technology innovations enable calibration-free operation. Moreover, all communications and phased array beam configuration functions are controlled from a single python-based API thereby allowing full beamforming control alongside other software defined radio communications parameters from a simple software interface.

	abstract     = {The 30-300GHz millimeter wave (mmWave) band is currently being pursued to combat the rising capacity demands in 5G, WiFi, and IoT networks. Due to the high frequency, impulse radio (IR) in this band is better suited for positioning than other existing low-frequency bands. Besides precision positioning, the exceptionally wide bandwidth also enables concurrent use of multiple center frequencies in the same application, which opens up additional avenues of information encoding in IR mmWave networks. In this paper, we propose a new mmWave IR framework that can simultaneously detect direction of arrival (DOA) as well as the center frequency of the transmitted pulse. Based on the emerging graphene-based transceivers, we evaluate the performance of the proposed framework in the higher frequency region of mmWave band (100-300GHz). Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework can detect the DOA of a 0.1 uW mmWave pulse within 1 degree of precision at 20 meters, and classify three different center frequencies with 100% accuracy from a distance of 10 meters. These performances could be further improved by trading off the pulse rate of the system.},

	abstract     = {The Sixth Generation (6G) of mobile networks is expected to use carrier frequencies in the spectrum above 100 GHz, to satisfy the demands for higher data rates and bandwidth of future digital applications. The development of networking solutions at such high frequencies is challenged by the harsh propagation environment, and by the need for directional communications and signal processing at high data rates. A fundamental step in defining and developing wireless networks above 100 GHz is given by an accurate performance evaluation. For simulations, this strongly depends on the accuracy of the modeling of the channel and of the interaction with the higher layers of the stack. This paper introduces the implementation of two recently proposed channel models (based on ray tracing and on a fully stochastic model) for the 140 GHz band for the ns-3 TeraSim module, which enables simulation of macro wireless networks in the sub-terahertz and terahertz spectrum. We also compare the two channel models with full-stack simulations in an indoor scenario, highlighting differences and similarities in how they interact with the protocol stack and antenna model of TeraSim.},

Further, real system deployments and tests are required to verify these methods in a practical setting. In this work, we develop mMobile, a custom 5G NR compliant mmWave testbed to evaluate beam management algorithms. We describe the architecture and challenges in building such a testbed. We then create a novel, low-complexity beam tracking algorithm by exploiting the 5G NR waveform structure and evaluate its performance on the testbed. The algorithm can sustain almost twice the average throughput compared to the baseline. We also release our outdoor mobility dataset that can be used to improve mobility management further.},

However, the directional mm-wave transmissions are prone to blockage, making seamless network coverage and mobility support very challenging. In this paper, we investigate the network control overhead requirements for mobility support in mm-wave urban cellular networks, using ray-tracing and realistic vehicular and pedestrian mobility models in Frankfurt and Seoul. We show that pedestrian mobility entails less network control overhead compared to vehicular, and that the latter is strongly dependent on the city layout, i.e. frequency of street intersections and traffic lights. This highlights the importance of realistically modeling the user (UE) trajectory in designing mobility support mechanisms. Our results also show that the rate of tracking events - i.e. adjusting the antenna alignment to maintain connectivity on the same mboxline-of-sight (LOS) or mboxnon-LOS link - is significantly higher than the rate of re-steering to a secondary link on the serving base station (BS), or handovers to another BS. This is due to the coverage being chiefly limited by building blockages, making it typically most attractive to provide mobility support via antenna realignment of the serving LOS link, emphasizing that UE tracking will be critical in mm-wave urban cellular network.},

	abstract     = {In recent years, millimeter-wave (mmWave) is becoming a significant component of the next-generation wireless communication due to its up to 7 Gbps transmission rate. In addition to the communication benefits, the unique sensing feature of mmWave attracts more attention. Nowadays, the services of human detection and identification are needed in numerous application scenarios, such as smart home and smart industry. The RF-based sensing techniques, especially WiFi-based, are widely utilized in human detection and identification. However, these work either require humans to carry devices or cannot detect and identify multiple people simultaneously. In this paper, we propose mmSense, a device-free multi-person detection and identification framework, which exploits the unique mmWave sensing features. First, we utilize the properties of directionality, impenetrability, and reflection of 60 GHz signal for objects to fingerprint the environments. Based on the generated environment fingerprints with and without human presence, mmSense can detect and localize the presence of multiple people simultaneously via the LSTM-based classification model. Moreover, we propose a novel approach to use humans' outline profile and vital signs to identify multiple people by using 60 GHz reflected signals of the human body. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the low-cost and effectiveness of our approach.},

To this end, beam alignment is achieved via a proper beam sensing protocol, which specifies how to allocate amplitude and phase at each antenna array element (a codeword) to sense the mobile user's position, through appropriate beam pointing. However, beam imperfections -- such as the presence of side-lobes -- and noise may cause errors in the detection process. Thus, correct alignment between transmitter and receiver may not be achieved. Therefore, it is of great importance to design the sensing codebook to attain optimal detection performance. In this paper, a Neyman-Pearson codebook design is proposed. The sensing codeword is optimized so as to minimize the mis-detection probability, under false-alarm, power and hybrid beamforming constraints. Due to the intractability of the problem, a worst-case relaxation is carried out. It is shown that the dual problem can be recast as a semidefinite program, and the optimal codebook is the principle eigenvector of a weighted array response matrix. It is shown numerically that the proposed design outperforms a state-of-the art algorithm, with improvement of up to 33% in detection performance.},

However, due to the high path loss at these frequencies, mm-wave systems rely on highly directional antennas, making precise antenna alignment a major issue. To provide seamless connectivity for mobile users, efficient beam tracking is thus crucial. In this paper we propose using motion sensor data to track small-scale rotational user motion and to thus correct mm-wave antenna misalignment at the mobile station (MS). To this end, we study in detail the characteristics of typical MS rotational motion using an Android app and mm-wave urban measurement data. We thereby evaluate the effectiveness of MS-based beam tracking, in terms of link stability and link quality, and derive practical engineering bounds on tracking delay and sensor accuracy. We show that, in order to make motion sensor-aided beam tracking beneficial, the tracking delay and sensor error must not exceed 30 ms and 1.2Â°, respectively, for our 10Â° antenna system. Although these requirements are within the capabilities of state-of-the-art MEMS chips, they cannot be guaranteed by the Android sensor API, suggesting that direct low-level access to the sensors should be provided to support mm-wave beam tracking.},

Compressive sensing is a promising framework to accelerate beam alignment. However, model mismatch from practical array hardware impairments poses a challenge to its implementation. In this work, we introduce a neural network assisted compressive beam alignment method that uses noncoherent received signal strength measured by a small number of pseudorandom sounding beams to infer the optimal beam steering direction. We experimentally showcase our proposed approach with a 60GHz 36-element phased array in a suburban line-of-sight environment. The results show that our approach achieves post alignment beamforming gain within 1dB margin compared to an exhaustive search with 90.2% overhead reduction.

	abstract     = {Millimeter-Wave (mmWave) wireless is experiencing an explosive growth in research and technology development. Several factors are fueling the growth: the need for Gigabit rates and low latency; advances in mmWave hardware, antennas, data converters, computational power, and prototyping platforms; and new paradigms for exploiting the large number of spatio-temporal degrees of freedom afforded by the large bandwidth and small wavelength. The challenges in harnessing the potential of mmWave wireless for communication and sensing are both physical and technological and inherently cross-disciplinary in nature. The tools available for research and technology development are rich and diverse, spanning signal processing and communication techniques, antenna, RF hardware and data converter design, prototype development and experimentation, and machine learning and data analytics. I will discuss the opportunities and implications with recent developments in hybrid beamforming architectures, the need for cross-layer networking protocols for exploiting the advanced physical layer capabilities, the importance of accurate channel models in network performance prediction and simulation, and the role of channel signatures in sensing applications. I will also highlight the dual and key role of prototype development in mmWave research: the cross-disciplinary challenges inherent in their design, and their facilitation of much needed channel measurements and experimentation. These findings and insights are informed by my group's involvement in mmWave research and technology development since 2010, and the outcomes of the first two workshops of the NSF Research Coordination Network on mmWave wireless.},

In this paper, we develop a beam probing and tracking algorithm that can efficiently track fast-moving mmWave beams. This algorithm has several salient features: (1) fading channel supportive: it can simultaneously track the channel coefficient and two-dimensional (2D) beam direction in fading channel environments; (2) low probing overhead: it achieves the minimum probing requirement for joint beam and channel tracking; (3) fast tracking speed and high tracking accuracy: its tracking error converges to the minimum Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) in static scenarios in theory and it outperforms several existing tracking algorithms with lower tracking error and faster tracking speed in simulations.},

Furthermore,mmWave communications will have to be integrated in a new redesigned network required by 5G to fulfill its ambitious targets. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a management agent for wireless devices deployed in a heterogeneous SDN wireless multi-hop research platform featuring mmwave communications for crosshauling (backhaul and fronthaul) purposes. The performance of the deployed mmwave network, based on the IEEE 802.11ad standard, is measured employing this agent. We measure the downtime in the presence of link up/down events, with obtained response times in the order of 10s-to-100s of milliseconds depending on the case. Furthermore, the TCP performance over the multi-hop 802.11ad mmwave network is also experimentally evaluated. In fact, TCP throughput up to around 800Mbps are obtained for single and multi-hop scenarios despite neighboring links using the same channel. Finally, one can also observe the impact of MTU size on TCP throughput, which may hinder the full exploitation of the mmWave link capacity when combined with other transport technologies, since the advantages of big MTUs (much bigger than the typical 1500 bytes) offered by mmwave devices may not be reaped.},

Transceivers mutually train their beams to provide strong gains in the desired direction. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art beam-training protocols, such as the IEEE 802.11ad sector sweep, do not protect against malicious behavior. As revealed recently, attackers can inject forged feedback into the sector sweep to cause devices to steer their beams to other than the indented directions. To protect against this kind of beam-stealing, we propose a sector sweep with authentication (SSA) that extends the prevalent sector sweep with an authentication scheme. Doing so, we ensure that devices only accept the feedback from their intended peers. A combination of simulations in ns-3 and measurements on off-the-shelf devices reveals that the performance overhead of SSA is only 7.3% in comparison to the original sector sweep.},

We then discuss the obtained path gain values and their fitted lines, and the resulting effective azimuth beamforming gain. Based on these results, we also study the link SNR values that can be supported on individual sidewalks and the corresponding theoretically achievable data rates.

	abstract     = {Gesture recognition is gaining attention as an attractive feature for the development of ubiquitous, context-aware, IoT applications. Use of radars as a primary or secondary system is tempting, as they can operate in darkness, high light intensity environments, and longer distances than many competitor systems. Starting from this observation, we present a generic, low-cost, mm-wave radar-based gesture recognition system. Among potential benefits of mm-wave radars are a high spatial resolution due to small wavelength, the availability of multiple antennas in a small area and the low interference due to the natural attenuation of mm-wave radiation. We experimentally evaluate our COTS solution considering eight different gestures and using two low-complexity classification algorithms: the unsupervised Self Organized Map (SOM) and the supervised Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ). To test robustness, we consider gestures performed by a human hand and a human body, at short and long distance. From our preliminary evaluations, we observe that LVQ and SOM correctly detect 75% and 60% of all gestures, respectively, from the raw, unprocessed data. The detection rate is significantly higher (&gt;90%) for selected gesture groups. We argue that performance suffers due to inaccurate AoA estimation. Accordingly, we evaluate our system employing a two-radar setup that increases the estimation accuracy by 8-9%.},

	abstract     = {Accurate performance prediction for the emerging 3GPP New Radio (NR) technology over millimeter-wave (mmWave) bands is crucial for the upcoming deployments of 5G and beyond cellular networks, utilizing NR. 3GPP has recently presented a 3D multipath cluster-based mmWave channel model for 5G NR, which captures the salient propagation characteristics of the mmWave bands, allowing for better prediction of mmWave system performance. However, it is difficult to directly employ the 3GPP models for analytical system characterization, as most of the parameters are computed through iterative algorithms. In the paper, we address this problem by presenting a statistical approximation for the important parameters of the 3GPP 3D cluster-based channel model, particularly, zenith angle of arrival and power share of every cluster. We then show how the constructed approximation can be used to analytically derive the performance indicators for mmWave NR systems, including outage probability. We compare the results obtained with our proposed statistical approximation model with those given by state-of-the-art simplified single cluster analytical models as well as illustrate the improvements in the accuracy of results.},

Connectivity also enables other applications such as infotainment or high levels of traffic coordination. Current solutions for vehicular communications though do not support the gigabit-per-second data rates. This presentation makes the case that millimeter wave communication is the only viable approach for high bandwidth connected vehicles.

In this paper, we rely on the commonly used Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) as the primary parameter for ranging and pedestrian localization. We use artificial neural networks to improve the performance of pedestrian localization by adding contextual information of the vehicular environment, such as vehicle velocity and direction to address the RF-based ranging challenges (i.e., multipath fading and shadowing). We show that the proposed scheme can improve the reliability and accuracy of RSSI-based ranging.},

This problem is constrained by factors like large number of cars, a need to perform updates quickly and securely, ability to do the update anywhere and any time, and delivering the often large update without harming the network. We present a scheduling approach for managing large FOTA downloads in a cellular network that combines historical network load with car usage and location analytics. The proposed approach uses a combination of heuristics and an optimized scheduler and applies them to schedule the admission of cars to download FOTA. Using real network data from a large cellular provider that includes a million cars and nearly a billion radio-level network connections, we show that our scheduling approach is feasible and practical. We also show that it is possible to manage FOTA even when device and network models use high levels of aggregation over time. Simulation results show that our method improves over random uncontrolled approaches by (i) reducing median download startup delay by 48%, (ii) reducing the number of cars that don't complete the update by 10% and most importantly, (iii) reducing the load in busy cells by up to 37%.},

However, challenges exist in managing transmission in densely populated areas with large numbers of VRUs, since these transmissions may overload the wireless channel leading to transmissions errors and increased battery consumption of the VRU device. This paper hence proposes a contextual transmission policy to address the above challenges. The policy leverages the GPS information available at a personal VRU device to control the message transmission rate for the VRU device. VRUs walking across a street are deemed highly vulnerable and use a larger message transmission rate. Others on the sidewalk are less vulnerable and transmitting fewer messages per time interval. Simulations of a Manhattan VRU scenario show that even with inaccurate GPS readings, significant numbers of transmission can be reduced, which results in a reduction of information age from being 90% of the times less than 1700 msec to 90% of the times less than 710 msec.},

The current vehicle-to-pedestrian (V2P) communication as stipulated by the standard such as SAE J2735 implies that it is mainly the vehicles that take the responsibility for VRU protection. In this VRU protection framework, user devices are essentially beacons that transmit Personal Safety Messages (PSMs). Upon receiving these PSMs, the drivers (or autonomous vehicles) take necessary measures to protect them. We, however, believe that the road users could also use the information about nearby vehicles to avoid dangerous situations. This paper discusses how the most distracted road user type, i.e., smartphone users, can use the Basic Safety Messages (BSMs) from nearby vehicles to notice approaching danger and take appropriate defensive actions. We build a complete prototype based on the IEEE Wireless Access in Vehicular Environment (WAVE) standards, and demonstrate how it can be used by pedestrians to notice imminent danger even while they are gazing at the smartphone screen.},

However, very limited experimental studies have been conducted to investigate the impact of Doppler shift on the vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication range and reliability with high-speed mobility. The current work-in-progress research aims to quantify the impact of Doppler effects on V2V communication reliability, range, and reachability using single-hop Dedicated Short-Range Communications (DSRC) between two opposite traffic. We conducted our experiments by mounting the after-market DSRC onboard units on the dashboard of two vehicles that cross each other from opposite directions with constant relative speeds on a real interstate freeway. Our preliminary results indicate that the communication time and range drop to approximately 70% and 40% after the two vehicles cross and start moving away from each other with the average relative speeds of 110 and 140 mph, respectively. Similarly, the packet delivery ratio is also drastically reduced after the vehicles start moving away from each other.

	abstract     = {Control of conventional transportation networks aims at bringing the state of the network to the system optimal (SO) state. This optimum is characterized by the minimality of the social cost function, i.e., the total cost of travel of all drivers. On the other hand, drivers are assumed to be rational and selfish, and make their travel decisions to optimize their own travel costs, bringing the state of the network to a user equilibrium (UE). In this paper, we model the behavior of users in the future connected vehicular transportation networks, where users consider both the travel cost and the utility from data communication when making their travel decisions. We divide the users into two groups based on the kind of data network they are using. We leverage the data communication aspect of the decision making to influence the user route choices, driving the UE state to the SO state. We propose a V2I bandwidth allocation scheme, which provides a guideline on how the system operator can adjust the parameters of the communication network to achieve the optimal UE.},

Recent advances in communications, controls and embedded systems have changed this model, paving the way to the Intelligent Vehicle Grid. The car is now a formidable sensor platform, absorbing information from the environment, from other cars (and from the driver) and feeding it to other cars and infrastructure to assist in safe navigation, pollution control and traffic management. The next step in this evolution is just around the corner: the Internet of Autonomous Vehicles. Like other important instantiations of the Internet of Things (e.g., the smart building, etc), the Internet of Vehicles will not only upload data to the Internet with V2I. It will also use V2V communications, storage, intelligence, and learning capabilities to anticipate the customers' intentions and learn from other peers. V2I and V2V are essential to the autonomous vehicle, but carry the risk of attacks. This paper will address the privacy attacks to which vehicles are exposed when they upload private data to Internet Servers. It will also outline efficient methods to preserve privacy.},

In this paper, we present a concept where we exploit parked cars to form a virtual network infrastructure. In particular, we form clusters representing a virtual road side unit spanning a relatively large geographical area. To reduce the channel load, we select a subset of the parked cars as active gateways to the cluster. This is done in a way to ensure that the connectivity to the cluster is not impaired. We evaluate the proposed algorithm using the Car4ICT architecture, a concept that enables cars in smart cities to discover and use various kinds of services.},

In this paper, we propose a third paradigm: a direct perception based approach to estimate the affordance for driving. We propose to map an input image to a small number of key perception indicators that directly relate to the affordance of a road/traffic state for driving. Our representation provides a set of compact yet complete descriptions of the scene to enable a simple controller to drive autonomously. Falling in between the two extremes of mediated perception and behavior reflex, we argue that our direct perception representation provides the right level of abstraction. We evaluate our approach in a virtual racing game as well as real world driving and show that our model can work well to drive a car in a very diverse set of virtual and realistic environments.},

In this work, we propose the concept of "Driving DNA" as a way of describing the complexity of driving behavior through a set of individual and easy-to-measure quantities. These quantities are responsible for some aspects of the driver's behavior, just as -- in the metaphor -- genes are responsible for the tracts of an individual.The concept has been tested on a dataset collected from the CAN bus consisting of more than 2000 trips performed by 53 people, in a wide scenario of road types and open traffic conditions. The Driving DNAs have been calculated for each person, and a graphical visualization of their comparison is provided.},

In this paper, we design a novel receiver-driven semi-broadcast scheme for vehicular applications, where receivers request broadcasting to their neighbors and data is broadcasted as a response.

The data plausibility is a longstanding issue for which various approaches based on sensor fusion, behavior analysis and communication constraints have been proposed, but none of these completely solve the problem. This paper proposes an angle of arrival (AoA) based method to invalidate position forging adversaries such as roadside attackers. Built entirely on the WAVE framework, it can be used even when the traditional sensor fusion-based or behavior-based check is inapplicable. The proposed approach is a completely passive scheme that does not require more than an additional antenna that is strongly recommended for performance anyway.},

These models are typically constructed using expensive techniques such as manual annotation with 3D modeling tools, extrapolated from satellite or aerial photography, or using specialized hardware with depth sensing devices. In this work, we show that 3D urban maps can be extracted from standard GNSS data, by analyzing the received satellite signals that are attenuated by obstacles, such as buildings. Furthermore, we show that these models can be extracted from low-accuracy GNSS data, crowdsourced opportunistically from standard smartphones during their user's uncontrolled daily commute trips, unleashing the potential of applying the principle to wide areas. Our proposal incorporates position inaccuracies in the calculations, and accommodates different sources of variability of the satellite signals' SNR. The diversity of collection conditions of crowdsourced GNSS positions is used to mitigate bias and noise from the data. A binary classification model is trained and evaluated on multiple urban scenarios using data crowdsourced from over 900 users. Our results show that the generalization accuracy for a Random Forest classifier in typical urban environments lies between 79% and 91% on 4 m wide voxels, demonstrating the potential of the proposed method for building 3D maps for wide urban areas.},

Given the WiFi signal measured when an unknown person walks in an unknown area and a video footage of a walking person in another area, XModal-ID can determine whether it is the same person in both cases or not. XModal-ID only uses the Channel State Information (CSI) magnitude measurements of a pair of off-the-shelf WiFi transceivers. It does not need any prior wireless or video measurement of the person to be identified. Similarly, it does not need any knowledge of the operation area or person's track. Finally, it can identify people through walls. XModal-ID utilizes the video footage to simulate the WiFi signal that would be generated if the person in the video walked near a pair of WiFi transceivers. It then uses a new processing approach to robustly extract key gait features from both the real WiFi signal and the video-based simulated one, and compares them to determine if the person in the WiFi area is the same person in the video. We extensively evaluate XModal-ID by building a large test set with $8$ subjects, $2$ video areas, and $5$ WiFi areas, including 3 through-wall areas as well as complex walking paths, all of which are not seen during the training phase. Overall, we have a total of 2,256 WiFi-video test pairs. XModal-ID then achieves an $85%$ accuracy in predicting whether a pair of WiFi and video samples belong to the same person or not. Furthermore, in a ranking scenario where XModal-ID compares a WiFi sample to $8$ candidate video samples, it obtains top-1, top-2, and top-3 accuracies of $75%$, $90%$, and $97%$. These results show that XModal-ID can robustly identify new people walking in new environments, in various practical scenarios.},

	abstract     = {With the rise of ever-more sophisticated wearables and sensing technologies, mobile health continues to be an active area of research. However, from a clinical researcher point of view, testing novel use of the mobile health innovations remains a major hurdle, as composing a clinical trial using a combination of technologies still remains in the realm of computer scientists. We take a software-inspired viewpoint of clinical trial designs to design, develop and validate HealthSense to enable expressibility of complex ideas, composability with diverse devices and services while maximally maintaining simplicity for a clinical research user. A key innovation in HealthSense is the concept of a study state manager (SSM) that modifies parameters of the study over time as data accumulates and can trigger external events that affect the participant; this design allows us to implement nearly arbitrary clinical trial designs. The SSM can funnel data streams to custom or third-party cloud processing pipelines and the result can be used to give interventions and modify parameters of the study. HealthSense supports both Android and iOS platforms and is secure, scalable and fully operational. We outline three trials (two with clinical populations) to highlight simplicity, composability, and expressibility of HealthSense.},

	abstract     = {Longer range, in rural/urban IoT networks, allow a large geographical coverage with only a few base-stations, making their deployment and operation economical. In this paper we explore the 150-174 MHz spectrum for long range IoT networks comprising unlicensed MURS and licensed VHF narrowbands. Range in these bands is boosted by the lower RF frequencies as well as higher transmit powers allowed by the FCC. Through a 400 sq km wide area deployment study, we show that, these spectrum bands can provide &gt; 20\texttimes{} the geographical coverage than that in the 900 MHz ISM band LoRa. Increased range translates to greater uplink IoT device traffic. The key contribution of this paper is a novel technique - Blind Distributed MU-MIMO, that allows capacity to scale with the number of antennas (base- stations) while not requiring any coordinated channel measurements between the devices and IoT base- stations. This requirement is crucial since in IoT networks power constrained IoT devices typically sleep and wake up to transmit short messages in response to unpredictable events without any coordination with the base-stations. We demonstrate the efficacy of Blind Distributed MU-MIMO through a real wide area deployment.},

A binary classification model is trained and evaluated on multiple urban scenarios.

In particular, we build the prototype of our system using a commodity smartwatch and a WebSocket server running on a laptop for CA.

In this work, we examine the LTE testing practices in terms of completeness and efficiency. We discover that the standardized tests are incomplete in that a number of test cases related to multiple protocol interactions are missing. Our analysis also shows that, the isolated treatment of test cases, but not from the system perspective, incurs repetitive executions of test operations, thus resulting in testing inefficiencies. We thus make a case for a paradigm shift from ad hoc testing to a methodical approach to LTE testing. We follow a few guidelines from the LTE standards and propose an algorithmic approach to systematic testing. In the process, we address various challenges, provide complete list of test cases, and present the related algorithms. Our evaluation shows that, by eliminating repetitive operations, our new scheme reduces up to 70% of LTE testing steps. We also find 87 new, yet valid test cases that are not defined by the LTE standards.},

MP-H2 strategically splits the file into byte range requests sent over multipath, and dynamically balances the workload across all paths. Furthermore, MP-H2 leverages new features in HTTP/2 including stream multiplexing, flow control, and application-layer PING to boost the performance. MP-H2 also supports multi-homing where each path contacts a different CDN server for enhanced performance. Evaluations show that MP-H2 offers only slightly degraded performance (6% on average) while being much easier to deploy compared to MPTCP.

To address these drawbacks, we utilize Electric Toll Collection systems (ETC) as a large-scale sensor network and design a system called VeMo to transparently model and predict vehicle mobility at the individual level with a full penetration rate. Our novelty is how we address uncertainty issues (i.e., unknown routes and speeds) due to sparse implicit ETC data based on a key data-driven insight, i.e., individual driving behaviors are strongly correlated with crowds of drivers under certain spatiotemporal contexts and can be predicted by combining both personal habits and context information. More importantly, we evaluate VeMo with (i) a large-scale ETC system with tracking devices at 773 highway entrances and exits capturing more than 2 million vehicles every day; (ii) a fleet consisting of 114 thousand vehicles with GPS data as ground truth. We compared VeMo with state-of-the-art benchmark mobility models, and the experimental results show that VeMo outperforms them by average 10% in terms of accuracy.},

However, the small form-factor, low-profile hardware interfaces and computational resources limit their capabilities in security checking. Many wristband devices have recently witnessed alarming vulnerabilities, e.g., personal data leakage and payment fraud, due to the lack of authentication and access control. To fill this gap, we propose a secure text pin input system, namely Taprint, which extends a virtual number pad on the back of a user's hand. Taprint builds on the key observation that the hand "landmarks'', especially finger knuckles, bear unique vibration characteristics when being tapped by the user herself. It thus uses the tapping vibrometry as biometrics to authenticate the user, while distinguishing the tapping locations. Taprint reuses the inertial measurement unit in the wristband, "overclocks'' its sampling rate to extrapolate fine-grained features, and further refines the features to enhance the uniqueness and reliability. Extensive experiments on 128 users demonstrate that Taprint achieves a high accuracy (96%) of keystrokes recognition. It can authenticate users, even through a single-tap, at extremely low error rate (2.4%), and under various practical usage disturbances.},

Often times, however, this crucial step is confined to small laboratory setups that do not capture the scale of commercial deployments and do not ensure result reproducibility and replicability, or it is skipped altogether for lack of suitable hardware and testing facilities. Recent years have seen the development of publicly-available testing platforms for wireless experimentation at scale. Examples include the testbeds of the PAWR program and Colosseum, the world's largest wireless network emulator. With its 256 software-defined radios, 24 racks of powerful compute servers and first-of-its-kind channel emulator, Colosseum allows users to prototype wireless solutions at scale, and guarantees reproducibility and replicability of results. This tutorial provides an overview of the Colosseum platform. We describe the architecture and components of the testbed as a whole, and we then showcase how to run practical experiments in diverse scenarios with heterogeneous wireless technologies (e.g., Wi-Fi and cellular). We also emphasize how Colosseum experiments can be ported to different testing platforms, facilitating full-cycle experimental wireless research: design, experiments and tests at scale in a fully controlled and observable environment and testing in the field. The tutorial concludes with considerations on the flexible future of Colosseum, focusing on its planned extension to emulate larger scenarios and channels at higher frequency bands (mmWave).},

We show that media sounds, such as the melodies of notification tones (e.g., iPhone message and Samsung whistle) can be directly used to sense and verify the user's gripping hand. Because sounds and vibrations co-exist, we capture two novel responses via the smartphone mic and accelerometer to describe how the individual's contacting palm interferes with the signals in two different domains. Based on the two responses, we develop a convolutional neural network-based algorithm to verify the user. Moreover, because the smartphone sensors are all embedded on the same motherboard, we develop a cross-domain method to validate such hard-to-forge physical relationships among the mic, speaker and accelerometer. They prevent external sounds from cheating the system. Additionally, we consider the notification vibration as a special type of media sound, which also results in two responses, and extend our method to work in the silent mode. Extensive experiments with ten notification tones and four phone models show that our system verifies users with 95% accuracy and prevents replay sounds with 100% accuracy.},

	abstract     = {RAN virtualization will become a key technology for the last mile of next-generation mobile networks driven by initiatives such as the O-RAN alliance. However, due to the computing fluctuations inherent to wireless dynamics and resource contention in shared computing infrastructure, the price to migrate from dedicated to shared platforms may be too high. Indeed, we show in this paper that the baseline architecture of a base station's distributed unit (DU) collapses upon moments of deficit in computing capacity. Recent solutions to accelerate some signal processing tasks certainly help but do not tackle the core problem: a DU pipeline that requires predictable computing to provide carrier-grade reliability.We present Nuberu, a novel pipeline architecture for 4G/5G DUs specifically engineered for non-deterministic computing platforms. Our design has one key objective to attain reliability: to guarantee a minimum set of signals that preserve synchronization between the DU and its users during computing capacity shortages and, provided this, maximize network throughput. To this end, we use techniques such as tight deadline control, jitter-absorbing buffers, predictive HARQ, and congestion control. Using an experimental prototype, we show that Nuberu attains &gt;95% of the theoretical spectrum efficiency in hostile environments, where state-of-art approaches lose connectivity, and at least 80% resource savings.},

	abstract     = {Being able to see into walls is crucial for diagnostics of building health; it enables inspections of wall structure without undermining the structural integrity. However, existing sensing devices do not seem to offer a full capability in mapping the in-wall structure while identifying their status (e.g., seepage and corrosion). In this paper, we design and implement SiWa as a low-cost and portable system for wall inspections. Built upon a customized IR-UWB radar, SiWa scans a wall as a user swipes its probe along the wall surface; it then analyzes the reflected signals to synthesize an image and also to identify the material status. Although conventional schemes exist to handle these problems individually, they require troublesome calibrations that largely prevent them from practical adoptions. To this end, we equip SiWa with a deep learning pipeline to parse the rich sensory data. With innovative construction and training, the deep learning modules perform structural imaging and the subsequent analysis on material status, without the need for repetitive parameter tuning and calibrations. We build SiWa as a prototype and evaluate its performance via extensive experiments and field studies; results evidently confirm that SiWa accurately maps in-wall structures, identifies their materials, and detects possible defects, suggesting a promising solution for diagnosing building health with minimal effort and cost.},

Once exposed, such in-SIM information can be used to reconstruct various keys used for device authentication, data encryption, etc. They thus enable a number of attacks, including traffic eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle attack, impersonation, etc. The fundamental problem is that, the current SIM design does not offer proper authentication and fine-grained access control to hundreds of in-SIM files for various in-card applets and off-card units. We next propose a new solution that offers both authentication and fine-grained access control. Our implementation and evaluation have confirmed the viability of our proposal.},

Moreover, customizing a UPF needs to reconstruct N3, N4, N6, and N9 interfaces, which takes much time for developers. To this end, we propose the user plane function development framework (UPFDF), which modularizes the functions in the UPF, supporting customization to connect different types of packet processing mechanisms.

Then we present two fault-tolerant approximate consensus algorithms, which minimizes storage complexity. In an n-node system, the first algorithm tolerates crash faults and only needs to store 4 values and an n-bit bit-vector, whereas the second algorithm tolerates up to f Byzantine faults, and needs to store 2f + 4 values and an n-bit bit-vector. In practice, these values are implemented using either integer or float data type. Compared to our algorithms, prior works may need to store O(nD) more values, where D is the number of rounds needed for convergence.},

This is especially true for smaller LEO satellites that are only visible at any location for a few tens of minutes a day and whose signals are extremely weak, necessitating bulky and expensive ground station infrastructure.In this paper, we present a community-driven distributed reception paradigm for LEO satellite signals where signals received on many tiny handheld receivers (not necessarily deployed on rooftops but also indoors) are coherently combined to recover the desired signal. This is made possible by employing new synchronization and receiver orientation techniques that study satellite trajectories and leverage the presence of other ambient signals. We compare our results with a large commercial receiver deployed on a rooftop and show a 8 dB SNR increase both indoors and outdoors using 8 receivers, costing $38 per RF frontend.},

	abstract     = {As mobile devices continuously generate streams of images and videos, a new class of mobile deep vision applications are rapidly emerging, which usually involve running deep neural networks on these multimedia data in real-time. To support such applications, having mobile devices offload the computation, especially the neural network inference, to edge clouds has proved effective. Existing solutions often assume there exists a dedicated and powerful server, to which the entire inference can be offloaded. In reality, however, we may not be able to find such a server but need to make do with less powerful ones. To address these more practical situations, we propose to partition the video frame and offload the partial inference tasks to multiple servers for parallel processing. This paper presents the design of Elf, a framework to accelerate the mobile deep vision applications with any server provisioning through the parallel offloading. Elf employs a recurrent region proposal prediction algorithm, a region proposal centric frame partitioning, and a resource-aware multi-offloading scheme. We implement and evaluate Elf upon Linux and Android platforms using four commercial mobile devices and three deep vision applications with ten state-of-the-art models. The comprehensive experiments show that Elf can speed up the applications by 4.85\texttimes{} with saving bandwidth usage by 52.6%, while with &lt;1% application accuracy sacrifice.},

UltraSE uses a commodity mobile device (e.g., smartphone) to emit ultrasound and capture the reflections from the speaker's articulatory gestures. It introduces a multi-modal, multi-domain deep learning framework to fuse the ultrasonic Doppler features and the audible speech spectrogram. Furthermore, it employs an adversarially trained discriminator, based on a cross-modal similarity measurement network, to learn the correlation between the two heterogeneous feature modalities. Our experiments verify that UltraSE simultaneously improves speech intelligibility and quality, and outperforms state-of-the-art solutions by a large margin.},

However, for systems-centric work on these topics, the research community must first overcome the hurdle of implementing fine-grained, over-the-air timing synchronization, which is critical for any coordinated operation. To address this gap, this paper presents an open-source design and implementation of 'RFClock' that provides timing, frequency and phase synchronization for software defined radios (SDRs). It shows how RFClock can be used for a practical, 5-node DCB application without modifying existing physical/link layer protocols. By utilizing a leader-follower architecture, RFClock-leader allows follower clocks to synchronize with mean offset under 0.107Hz, and then corrects the time/phase alignment to be within a 5ns deviation. RFClock is designed to operate in generalized environments: as standalone unit, it generates a 10MHz/1PPS signal reference suitable for most commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) SDRs today; it does not require custom protocol-specific headers or messaging; and it is robust to interference through a frequency-agile operation. Using RFClock for DCB, we verify significant increase in channel gain and low BER in a range of [0 -- 10--3] for different modulation schemes. We also demonstrate performance that is similar to a popular wired solution and significant improvement over a GPS-based solution, while delivering this functionality at a fractional price/power point.},

The sensor powers up by harvesting energy from RF signals and communicates at near-zero power via backscatter. In contrast to prior designs which cannot operate across various in-body environments, our sensor can self-reconfigure to adapt to different tissues and channel conditions. This adaptation is made possible by two key innovations: a reprogrammable antenna that can tune its energy harvesting resonance to surrounding tissues, and a backscatter rate adaptation protocol that closes the feedback loop by tracking circuit-level sensor hints.We built our design on millimeter-sized integrated chips and flexible antenna substrates, and tested it in environments that span both in-vitro (fluids) and ex-vivo (tissues) conditions. Our evaluation demonstrates Î¼medIC's ability to tune its energy harvesting resonance by more than 200 MHz (i.e., adapt to different tissues) and to scale its bitrate by an order of magnitude up to 6Mbps, allowing it to support higher data rate applications (such as streaming low-res images) without sacrificing availability. This rate adaptation also allows Î¼medIC to scale its energy consumption by an order of magnitude down to 350 nanoWatts. These capabilities pave way for a new generation of networked micro-implants that can adapt to complex and time-varying in-body environments.},

	abstract     = {Current LoRa networks including those following the LoRaWAN specification use the primitive ALOHA mechanism for media access control due to LoRa's lack of carrier sense capability. From our extensive measurements, the Channel Activity Detection (CAD) feature that is recently introduced to LoRa for energy-efficiently detecting preamble chirps, can also detect payload chirps reliably. This sheds light on an efficient carrier-sense multiple access (CSMA) protocol that we call LMAC for LoRa networks. This paper presents the designs of three advancing versions of LMAC that respectively implements CSMA, balances the communication loads among the channels defined by frequencies and spreading factors based on the end nodes' local information and then additionally the gateway's global information. Experiments on a 50-node lab testbed and a 16-node university deployment show that, compared with ALOHA, LMAC brings up to 2.2\texttimes{} goodput improvement and 2.4\texttimes{} reduction of radio energy per successfully delivered frame. Thus, should the LoRaWAN's ALOHA be replaced with LMAC, network performance boosts can be realized.},

	abstract     = {Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems are the industrial control systems and operational infrastructure that can monitor and control the electricity grid. Electricity grids are increasingly transforming from the one-directional way of generating, transmitting, and distributing electricity to smart grids that are multi-directional in the way they monitor, automate, and remotely operate the power sector. SCADA systems are increasingly under cyber attacks illustrating growing vulnerabilities to the smart grids. The U.S. power industry notes the importance of SCADA chain cyber risks and the need to take proactive measures (timely patching of vulnerabilities) to mitigate the risks. However, not all vulnerabilities are always exploited by attackers; and not all vulnerabilities can be patched in resource-constrained scenarios. Therefore, the patch sequence needs to be strategic and efficient.In this poster, we address the critical need to prioritize patching the smart grid SCADA systems on time. This is even more prominent with the advent of new technologies, usage of backup systems, updated standards, and new regulations on the safety and security of the smart grid. In this direction, we present SmartPatch - a patch prioritization method to address patch sequencing of the SCADA chain in the smart grid systems. It analyzes the possible attacker behavior as well as system criticality using game theory for decision making. It provides a patch prioritization strategy that is cost-constrained and reduces the impact of the possible attacks to a large extent.},

	abstract     = {With increasing private and sensitive data stored in mobile devices, secure and effective mobile-based user authentication schemes are desired. As the most natural way to contact with mobile devices, finger touches have shown potentials for user authentication. Most existing approaches utilize finger touches as behavioral biometrics for identifying individuals, which are vulnerable to spoofer attacks. To resist attacks for on-touch user authentication on mobile devices, this paper exploits physical characters of touching fingers by investigating active vibration signal transmission through fingers, and we find that physical characters of touching fingers present unique patterns on active vibration signals for different individuals. Based on the observation, we propose a behavior-irrelevant on-touch user authentication system, TouchPass, which leverages active vibration signals on smartphones to extract only physical characters of touching fingers for user identification. TouchPass first extracts features that mix physical characters of touching fingers and behavior biometrics of touching behaviors from vibration signals generated and received by smartphones. Then, we design a Siamese network-based architecture with a specific training sample selection strategy to reconstruct the extracted signal features to behavior-irrelevant features and further build a behavior-irrelevant on-touch user authentication scheme leveraging knowledge distillation. Our extensive experiments validate that TouchPass can accurately authenticate users and defend various attacks.},

A typical IoT application usually consists of three essential parts: the device side, the cloud side, and the client side. The development of a complete IoT application is very difficult for non-expert developers because it involves drastically different technologies and complex interactions between different sides. Unlike traditional IoT development platforms which use separate approaches for these three sides, we present TinyLink 2.0, an integrated IoT development approach with a single coherent language. It achieves high expressiveness for diverse IoT applications by an enhanced IFTTT rule design and a virtual sensor mechanism which helps developers express application logic with machine learning. Moreover, TinyLink 2.0 optimizes the IoT application performance by using both static and dynamic optimizers, especially for resource-constrained IoT devices. We implement TinyLink 2.0 and evaluate it with eight case studies, a user study, and a detailed evaluation of the proposed programming language as well as the performance optimizers. Results show that TinyLink 2.0 can speed up IoT development significantly compared with existing approaches from both industry and academia, while still achieving high expressiveness.},

	abstract     = {Drug effectiveness management is a complicated and challenging task in chronic diseases, like Parkinson's Disease (PD). Drug effectiveness control is not only linked to personal out-of-pocket cost but also affecting the quality of life among patients with chronic symptoms. In the current practice, although that health and medical professionals still play a key role in the personalized treatment plan, the critical decision on drug selection falls upon the individual report when patients call in or visit the clinics. Unfortunately, most of the patients with chronic diseases either fail to report their day-to-day symptoms or have a limited access to medical resources due to economic constraints. In this paper, we present PDLens, a first smartphone-based system to detect drug effectiveness among Parkinson's in daily life. Specifically, PDLens can extract digital behavioral markers related to PD drug responses from everyday activities, including phone calls, standing, and walking. PDLens models the PD symptom severity on drug treatment and detects the change of severity scores before and after drug intake. A ranking-based multi-view deep neural network is developed to decide the drug effectiveness upon the symptom severity changes. To validate the performance of PDLens, we conduct a pilot study with 81 PD patients and monitor their smartphone activities and severity changes over 33693 drug intake events across six (6) months. Compared with the standard clinical drug effectiveness test developed by Motor Disorder Society, results reveal that PDLens is a promising tool to facilitate drug effectiveness detection among PD patients in their daily lives.},

We conduct a detailed investigation of each of the following aspects for point cloud streaming (a popular volumetric data format): encoding, decoding, segmentation, viewport movement patterns, and viewport prediction. Motivated by the observations from the above study, we propose ViVo, which is to the best of our knowledge the first practical mobile volumetric video streaming system with three visibility-aware optimizations. ViVo judiciously determines the video content to fetch based on how, what and where a viewer perceives for reducing bandwidth consumption of volumetric video streaming. Our evaluations over real wireless networks (including commercial 5G), mobile devices and users indicate that ViVo can save on average 40% of data usage (up to 80%) with virtually no drop in visual quality.},

With the recent trends in the networking ecosystem-the rise of IoT devices, high bandwidth wireless, and powerful, energy-efficient, and inexpensive computation-edge computing is a promising technology for highly interactive and immersive environments. This tutorial aims to promote awareness of the possibilities of edge computing in general and introduce attendees to the tools that they can use to begin exploring this space. The tutorial's activities will give attendees hands-on experience with the ParaDrop edge computing platform developed at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. We hope to impart working knowledge about edge computing and our vision for its future. Recent developments in home wireless networks such as the proliferation of connected devices (e.g. Internet-of-Things) and gigabit wireless (e.g. 802.11ac) create an environment where edge computing can truly enhance applications. The availability of low latency and high bandwidth at the network edge but not necessarily end-to-end to the cloud, can enable interesting new applications involving video (e.g. augmented reality), low latency sensor-actuator coordination, and other public safety or educational applications. However, before such applications emerge, there needs to be a platform available for them. We argue that the availability of widespread platforms and standards for edge computing will unleash a new wave of innovation much like the creation of app markets for mobile devices. The hardware exists, e.g. in the form of millions of always-on Wi-Fi routers in homes and businesses, but it is not very programmable. With our tutorial, we aim to foster awareness of the possibilities that exist with edge computing and promote the advancement of research toward good standards for its realization. We introduce the ParaDrop platform as an open source demonstration of our vision for edge computing. We have been single-mindedly focused on researcher and developer needs in creating the ParaDrop platform. As such, applications that are already written to be run as cloud services can be easily modified to run on the ParaDrop platform in order to benefit from running at the network edge. Applications are not required to be written in a highly specialized language, and applications are able to leverage the rapidly growing software ecosystem surrounding Docker. Our tutorial will give researchers a hands-on experience with the platform and knowledge that they will be able to use beyond the workshop.},

We also determine the average physical-layer bitrate used on the down link (AP to client) and compare it with the maximum supported bitrate. We find that about 75% of 802.11n and 50% of 802.11ac client devices operate at 75% of their maximum or more and that the bitrates of the remaining devices can be very far from their maximum. These low bitrates could significantly reduce the throughput of high-bitrate devices.},

MegaSense involves a novel hierarchy of multi-vendor distributed air quality sensors, in which accurate sensors calibrate lower cost sensors. Current low-cost air quality sensors suffer from measurement drift and they have low accuracy. We address this significant open problem for dense urban areas by developing a calibration scheme that detects and automatically corrects drift. MegaSense integrates with the 5G cellular network and leverages mobile edge computing for sensor management and distributed pollution map creation. We demonstrate MegaSense with two sensor types, a state of the art air quality monitoring station and a low-cost sensor array, with calibration between the two to improve the accuracy of the low-cost device. Participants can interact with the sensors and see air quality changes in real-time, and observe the mechanism to mitigate sensor drift. Our re-calibration method minimizes the error for NO2 and O3 81% of the time (vs single calibration) and reduces the mean relative error by 25%-45%.},

In normal time, EasyGO can estimate the density of indoor people in each area and determine the moving speeds to pass through different areas. Based on the determined moving speed of each area, an indoor navigation path can be planned to provide the shortest moving time for EasyGO users. In emergent time, EasyGO can accurately estimate the escaping time for each EasyGO user by considering the capacity and length of passageways, the capacity of exits, and the current distribution and parallel moving of indoor people. Based on the estimated escaping time, EasyGO can evenly distribute the evacuation load among exits and alleviate the congestion of all passageways and exits to minimize the total escaping time. An Android-based prototype with iBeacon indoor localization is implemented to verify the feasibility of our EasyGO system.},

In this demo, we present a practical CTC application, called \o{}ursystem, allowing a 2.4GHz WiFi receiver (eg. a smartphone) to identify UHF RFID tags, which operates at the spectrum between 840~920MHz. \o{}ursystem leverages the underlying harmonic backscattering of tags to open a second channel and uses it to communicate with WiFi receivers. We design and implement \o{}ursystem with commodity WiFi chipsets. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that \o{}ursystem allows WiFi receivers to identify UHF RFID tags within the range of $2$ m and with a median goodput of 95%, which is comparable to today's mobile RFID readers.},

Applications of these techniques are in indoor localization, gesture recognition, inventory tracking, vehicular motion, and many others. This paper identifies room for improvement over today's motion tracking techniques. The core observation is that conventional systems have trusted gravity more than the magnetic North to infer the 3D orientation of the object. We find that the reverse is more effective, especially when the object is in continuous fast motion. We leverage this opportunity to design MUSE, a magnetometer-centric sensor fusion algorithm for orientation tracking. Moreover, when the object's motion is somewhat restricted (e.g., human-arm motion restricted by elbow and shoulder joints), we find new methods of sensor fusion to fully leverage the restrictions. Real experiments across a wide range of uncontrolled scenarios show consistent improvement in orientation and location accuracy, without requiring any training or machine learning. We believe this is an important progress in the otherwise mature field of IMU-based motion tracking.},

To scale up to a larger problem size, CrossSense adopts a mixture-of-experts approach where multiple specialized sensing models, or experts, are used to capture the mapping from diverse WiFi inputs to the desired outputs. The experts are trained offline and at runtime the appropriate expert for a given input is automatically chosen. We evaluate CrossSense by applying it to two representative WiFi sensing applications, gait identification and gesture recognition, in controlled single-link environments. We show that CrossSense boosts the accuracy of state-of-the-art WiFi sensing techniques from 20% to over 80% and 90% for gait identification and gesture recognition respectively, delivering consistently good performance - particularly when the problem size is significantly greater than that current approaches can effectively handle.},

	abstract     = {Driven by a wide range of real-world applications, significant efforts have recently been made to explore device-free human activity recognition techniques that utilize the information collected by various wireless infrastructures to infer human activities without the need for the monitored subject to carry a dedicated device. Existing device free human activity recognition approaches and systems, though yielding reasonably good performance in certain cases, are faced with a major challenge. The wireless signals arriving at the receiving devices usually carry substantial information that is specific to the environment where the activities are recorded and the human subject who conducts the activities. Due to this reason, an activity recognition model that is trained on a specific subject in a specific environment typically does not work well when being applied to predict another subject's activities that are recorded in a different environment. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose EI, a deep-learning based device free activity recognition framework that can remove the environment and subject specific information contained in the activity data and extract environment/subject-independent features shared by the data collected on different subjects under different environments. We conduct extensive experiments on four different device free activity recognition testbeds: WiFi, ultrasound, 60 GHz mmWave, and visible light. The experimental results demonstrate the superior effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed EI framework.},

Hu-Fu is built on two fundamental ideas, namely inductive coupling of two tags and signal randomization.

To identify different human activities, an automatic kernel representation learning method, namely auto-HSRL, is established to selection informative Hilbert space patterns from time, frequency, wavelet, and shape domains. A new information fusion tool based on multi-view kernel learning is proposed to combine the representations extracted from diverse perspectives and build up a robust and comprehensive activity classifier.

Road conditions in developing countries like India are chaotic where roads are not well maintained and thus vehicular sensors alone do not suffice in detecting impending collisions. In this paper, we investigate a collaborative driver assistance system "DRIZY: DRIve eaSY" for such scenarios where inference is drawn from on-board camera feed to alert drivers of obstacles ahead and the cloud uses GPS sensor data uploaded by all vehicles to alert drivers of vehicles in potential collision trajectory. Thus, we combine computer vision and vehicle-to-cloud communication to create comprehensive situational awareness. We prototype our system to consider two types of collisions: vehicle-to-vehicle collisions based on uploading GPS sensor data of vehicles to cloud and vehicle-to-pedestrian collisions based on detecting pedestrians from vehicle's dashboard camera feed. Sensor data processing in each vehicle occurs on smartphone for GPS values which are then uploaded to cloud and on raspberry pi3 for video feeds to make a cost-effective solution. Experiments over both 4G and wireless networks in India show that collaborative driver assistance is feasible in low traffic density within acceptable driver reaction time of &lt;5 sec, but can be limited by the time to process compute-intensive video feeds in real-time. We investigate novel ways to optimize the processing to find an acceptable trade-off.},

Our system requires no modification to the existing light infrastructure and uses unmodulated ambient light as sensing medium. We achieve this by designing a sensing mechanism that uses solar cells to achieve sub-Î¼Ws of power consumption. Further, we devise an ultra-low power backscatter based transmission mechanism we call Scatterlight that transmits digital readings without incurring the processing and computation overhead of existing sensors. Based on these principles we build a preliminary prototype. Our initial results demonstrate its ability to sense and communicate three hand gestures at 20 Î¼Ws of power.},

In contrast to a recent study that reports reduced throughput with MPTCP compared to single path TCP over 60 GHz, our results show that significant performance improvements are possible, especially in the case of uncoupled congestion control. On the other hand, performance gains with coupled congestion control are lower as these algorithms often fail to fully utilize the capacity of both paths simultaneously.

In order to address these problems, the concept of "smart parking" is put forward. To make a parking lot "smart", we argue that three basic features, namely Vehicle Identification, Parking Space Detection and Indoor Localization are are critical and should be supported by the infrastructure. Herein, we present LightPark, a Visible Light Communication (VLC) solution to realize the vision of "smart parking". Building on top of the visible light backscatter communication primitive, LightPark is able to leverage the lighting infrastructure to perform scalable visible light communication and networking with the batter-free tag devices instrumented on the vehicles and parking spaces to manage the critical information such as identification and real-time location of vehicles, and status of parking spaces in a centralized and low-cost manner.},

Although some standards already define the possibility of utilizing multiple channel widths (e.g. 20MHz, 10MHz, 5MHz for IEEE 802.11a standards), such an utilization is limited to a static configuration of a value defined during the network set-up. Conversely, we demonstrate that channel width adaptations can be performed in real-time during network operation, even on a per-packet basis. To this purpose, we propose an innovative and efficient receiver design, which allows the transmitter to take decisions about the channel width without explicitly informing the receiver.},

Besides it features a hierarchical control plane architecture that enables programmability, flexible and dynamic control function placement (allowing different degrees of coordination within and among base stations) and real-time control. Virtualized control functions and control delegation are two key features in FlexRAN that makes these capabilities possible. This demo illustrates the capabilities and the performance of FlexRAN based on a prototype implementation, while its applicability is highlighted through a Mobile Edge Computing use case, where it acts as an enabler of a video bitrate adaptation application based on the radio conditions at the network edge.},

We present RF-Echo, a new low-power RF localization solution that achieves decimeter accuracy in long range indoor non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios. RF-Echo introduces a custom-designed active RF reflector ASIC (application specific integrated circuit) fabricated in a 180nm CMOS process which echoes a frequency-shifted orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal originally generated from an anchor. The proposed technique is based on time-of-flight (ToF) estimation in the frequency domain that effectively eliminates inter-carrier and inter-symbol interference in multipath-rich indoor NLOS channels. RF-Echo uses a relatively narrow bandwidth of $leq$80 MHz which does not require an expensive very high sampling rate analog-to-digital converter (ADC). Unlike ultra-wideband (UWB) systems, the active reflection scheme is designed to operate at a relatively low carrier frequency that can penetrate building walls and other blocking objects for challenging NLOS scenarios. Since the bandwidth at lower frequencies (2.4 GHz and sub-1 GHz) is severely limited, we propose novel signal processing algorithms as well as machine learning techniques to significantly enhance the localization resolution given the bandwidth constraint of the proposed system. The newly fabricated tag IC consumes 62.8 mW active power. The software defined radio (SDR) based anchor prototype is rapidly deployable without the need for accurate synchronization among anchors and tags. Field trials conducted in a university building confirm up to 85 m operation with decimeter accuracy for robust 2D localization.},

Existing parallel decoding mechanisms, however, assume that signals of the tags are highly stable, and hence may not perform optimally in the naturally dynamic backscatter systems. This paper introduces FlipTracer, a practical system that achieves highly reliable parallel decoding even in hostile channel conditions. FlipTracer is designed with a key insight: although the collided signal is time-varying and irregular, transitions between signals' combined states follow highly stable probabilities, which offers important clues for identifying the collided signals, and provides us with an opportunity to decode the collided signals without relying on stable signals. Motivated by this observation, we propose a graphical model, called one-flip-graph (OFG), to capture the transition pattern of collided signals, and design a reliable approach to construct the OFG in a manner robust to the diversity in backscatter systems. Then FlipTracer can resolve the collided signals by tracking the OFG. We have implemented FlipTracer and evaluated its performance with extensive experiments across a wide variety of scenarios. Our experimental results have shown that FlipTracer achieves a maximum aggregated throughput that approaches 2 Mbps, which is 6x higher than the state-of-the-art.},

Proxies that execute Web page JavaScript (JS) and push objects needed by the client can reduce latency. However, a key concern is the scalability of the proxy which must execute JS for many concurrent users. In this paper, we propose to scale the proxies, focusing on a design where the proxy's execution is solely to push the needed objects and the client completely executes the page as normal. Such redundant execution is a simple, yet effective approach to cutting network latencies, which dominate page load delays in cellular settings. We develop whittling, a technique to identify and execute in the proxy only the JS code necessary to identify and push the objects required for the client page load, while skipping other code. Whittling is closely related to program slicing, but with the important distinction that it is acceptable to approximate the program slice in the proxy given the client's complete execution. Experiments with top Alexa Web pages show NutShell can sustain, on average, 27% more user requests per second than a proxy performing fully redundant execution, while preserving, and sometimes enhancing, the latency benefits.},

WEBee uses a high-speed wireless radio (e.g., WiFi OFDM) to emulate the desired signals of a low-speed radio (e.g., ZigBee). Our unique emulation technique manipulates only the payload of WiFi packets, requiring neither hardware nor firmware changes in commodity technologies -- a feature allowing zero-cost fast deployment on existing WiFi infrastructure. We designed and implemented WEBee with commodity devices (Atheros AR2425 WiFi card and MicaZ CC2420) and the USRP-N210 platform (for PHY layer evaluation). Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that WEBee can achieve a more than 99% reliable parallel CTC between WiFi and ZigBee with 126 Kbps in noisy environments, a throughput about 16,000x faster than current state-of-the-art CTCs.},

	abstract     = {Open experimentation with operational Mobile Broadband (MBB) networks in the wild is currently a fundamental requirement of the research community in its endeavor to address the need of innovative solutions for mobile communications. Even more, there is a strong need for objective data about stability and performance of MBB (e.g., 3G/4G) networks, and for tools that rigorously and scientifically assess their status. In this paper, we introduce the MONROE measurement platform: an open access and flexible hardware-based platform for measurements and custom experimentation on operational MBB networks. The MONROE platform enables accurate, realistic and meaningful assessment of the performance and reliability of 11 MBB networks in Europe. We report on our experience designing, implementing and testing the solution we propose for the platform. We detail the challenges we overcame while building and testing the MONROE testbed and argue our design and implementation choices accordingly. We describe and exemplify the capabilities of the platform and the wide variety of experiments that external users already perform using the system.},

These limitations have severely restricted the adoption of hand tracking in real-world applications.

	abstract     = {Infrastructure-assisted autonomous driving is an emerging paradigm that aims to make affordable autonomous vehicles a reality. A key technology for realizing this vision is real-time point cloud registration which allows a vehicle to fuse the 3D point clouds generated by its own LiDAR and those on roadside infrastructures such as smart lampposts, which can deliver increased sensing range, more robust object detection, and centimeter-level navigation. Unfortunately, the existing methods for point cloud registration assume two clouds to share a similar perspective and large overlap, which result in significant delay and inaccuracy in real-world infrastructure-assisted driving settings. This paper proposes VI-Eye - the first system that can align vehicle-infrastructure point clouds at centimeter accuracy in real-time. Our key idea is to exploit traffic domain knowledge by detecting a set of key semantic objects including road, lane lines, curbs, and traffic signs. Based on the inherent regular geometries of such semantic objects, VI-Eye extracts a small number of saliency points and leverage them to achieve real-time registration of two point clouds. By allowing vehicles and infrastructures to extract the semantic information in parallel, VI-Eye leads to a highly scalable architecture for infrastructure-assisted autonomous driving. To evaluate the performance of VI-Eye, we collect two new multiview LiDAR point cloud datasets on an indoor autonomous driving testbed and a campus smart lamppost testbed, respectively. They contain total 915 point cloud pairs and cover three roads of 1.12km. Experiment results show that VI-Eye achieves centimeter-level accuracy within around 0.2s, and delivers a 5X improvement in accuracy and 2X speedup over state-of-the-art baselines.},

Existing mechanisms either compromise on the quality of insights by not building 3D images and analyze individual 2D images in isolation, or spend tens of minutes building a 3D image before obtaining and uploading insights. We present Visage, a system that accelerates 3D image analytics by identifying smaller parts of the data that can actually benefit from 3D analytics and prioritizing building, and uploading the localized 3D images for those parts. To achieve this, Visage uses a graph to represent raw 2D images and their relative content overlap, and then identifies the various subgraphs using application knowledge that are good candidates for localized 3D image based insights. We evaluate Visage using data from multiple real deployments and show that it can reduce analytics-latency by up to four orders of magnitude.},

And recently there has been a large shift from handheld-controller dominated interactions to headset-dominated interactions via voice interfaces. In this work, we show a serious privacy risk of using voice interfaces while the user is wearing the face-mounted AR/VR devices. Specifically, we design an eavesdropping attack, Face-Mic, which leverages speech-associated subtle facial dynamics captured by zero-permission motion sensors in AR/VR headsets to infer highly sensitive information from live human speech, including speaker gender, identity, and speech content. Face-Mic is grounded on a key insight that AR/VR headsets are closely mounted on the user's face, allowing a potentially malicious app on the headset to capture underlying facial dynamics as the wearer speaks, including movements of facial muscles and bone-borne vibrations, which encode private biometrics and speech characteristics. To mitigate the impacts of body movements, we develop a signal source separation technique to identify and separate the speech-associated facial dynamics from other types of body movements. We further extract representative features with respect to the two types of facial dynamics. We successfully demonstrate the privacy leakage through AR/VR headsets by deriving the user's gender/identity and extracting speech information via the development of a deep learning-based framework. Extensive experiments using four mainstream VR headsets validate the generalizability, effectiveness, and high accuracy of Face-Mic.},

	abstract     = {A long-standing challenge in radios for wearables is to design ultra-low power, yet high performance receivers with good sensitivity and spectral efficiency while being compatible with WiFi. The vanilla envelope detector used in standard UHF RFID is the most popular receivers on backscatter tags since they are passive but suffer from poor sensitivity and cannot decode complex modulations, which makes them a poor choice for directly decoding data from WiFi packets.In this paper, we present the design of an easy-to-prototype ultra-low power WiFi receiver called MIXIQ that operates at Î¼Ws of power while providing improved sensitivity and decode-ability of complex high-rate signals. MIXIQ uses the signaling capabilities of the newest standard of WiFi, 802.11ax, to turn a standard WiFi packet into a helper + data signal. The same non-linear RF circuit used in a vanilla envelope detector, when driven by this twin signal, now behaves like a passive mixer i.e. it down-converts the RF carrier data to the sub-MHz range without adding any energy overhead. MIXIQ then uses an ultra low-power largely digital baseband pipeline to (i) significantly boost sensitivity using ultra low power components; (ii) enable the demodulation of complex signals for substantial boost in spectral efficiency. We show that MIXIQ improves upon the vanilla envelope detector by 25dB in sensitivity and 89\texttimes{} in bandwidth efficiency, while consuming 0.3mW for a PCB-based implementation and 40Î¼W for CMOS simulation. We also demonstrate a Hearable system that leverages MIXIQ to improve VOIP reception range by 10\texttimes{} compared to a vanilla envelope detector.},

	abstract     = {Wireless sensing builds upon machine learning shows encouraging results. However, adopting wireless sensing as a large-scale solution remains challenging as experiences from deployments have shown the performance of a machine-learned model to suffer when there are changes in the environment, e.g., when furniture is moved or when other objects are added or removed from the environment. We present Rise, a novel solution for enhancing the robustness and performance of learning-based wireless sensing techniques against such changes during a deployment. Rise combines probability and statistical assessments together with anomaly detection to identify samples that are likely to be misclassified and uses feedback on these samples to update a deployed wireless sensing model. We validate Rise through extensive empirical benchmarks by considering 11 representative sensing methods covering a broad range of wireless sensing tasks. Our results show that Rise can identify 92.3% of misclassifications on average. We showcase how Rise can be combined with incremental learning to help wireless sensing models retain their performance against dynamic changes in the operating environment to reduce the maintenance cost, paving the way for learning-based wireless sensing to become capable of supporting long-term monitoring in complex everyday environments.},

	abstract     = {Over the last decade, facial landmark tracking and 3D reconstruction have gained considerable attention due to their numerous applications such as human-computer interactions, facial expression analysis, and emotion recognition, etc. Traditional approaches require users to be confined to a particular location and face a camera under constrained recording conditions (e.g., without occlusions and under good lighting conditions). This highly restricted setting prevents them from being deployed in many application scenarios involving human motions. In this paper, we propose the first single-earpiece lightweight biosensing system, BioFace-3D, that can unobtrusively, continuously, and reliably sense the entire facial movements, track 2D facial landmarks, and further render 3D facial animations. Our single-earpiece biosensing system takes advantage of the cross-modal transfer learning model to transfer the knowledge embodied in a high-grade visual facial landmark detection model to the low-grade biosignal domain. After training, our BioFace-3D can directly perform continuous 3D facial reconstruction from the biosignals, without any visual input. Without requiring a camera positioned in front of the user, this paradigm shift from visual sensing to biosensing would introduce new opportunities in many emerging mobile and IoT applications. Extensive experiments involving 16 participants under various settings demonstrate that BioFace-3D can accurately track 53 major facial landmarks with only 1.85 mm average error and 3.38% normalized mean error, which is comparable with most state-of-the-art camera-based solutions. The rendered 3D facial animations, which are in consistency with the real human facial movements, also validate the system's capability in continuous 3D facial reconstruction.},

Prior work has implemented this functionality based on cameras, acoustic signals, and Wi-Fi via existing hardware on commercial devices. However, these methods have low user acceptance. Solutions based on cameras and acoustic signals raise privacy concerns, while WiFi-based solutions are vulnerable to background noise. As a result, these methods are not commercialized and recent flagship smartphones have implemented in-air gesture recognition by adding extra hardware on-board, such as mmWave radar and depth camera. The question is, can we support in-air gesture control on legacy devices without any hardware modifications?To answer this question, in this work, we propose SMART, an in-air gesture recognition system leveraging the screen and ambient light sensor (ALS), which are ordinary modalities on mobile devices. For the transmitter side, we design a screen display mechanism to embed spatial information and preserve the viewing experience; for the receiver side, we develop a framework to recognize gestures from low-quality ALS readings. We implement and evaluate SMART on both a tablet and several smartphones. Results show that SMART can recognize 9 types of frequently used in-air gestures with an average accuracy of 96.1%.},

Specifically, we look at gait-based identification from the sounds induced by walking and propagated through the musculoskeletal system in the body. Our system, EarGate, leverages an in-ear facing microphone which exploits the earable's occlusion effect to reliably detect the user's gait from inside the ear canal, without impairing the general usage of earphones. With data collected from 31 subjects, we show that EarGate achieves up to 97.26% Balanced Accuracy (BAC) with very low False Acceptance Rate (FAR) and False Rejection Rate (FRR) of 3.23% and 2.25%, respectively.

To protect the privacy of users' local data, we innovatively introduce the idea of federated learning into the field of wireless sensing, by uploading users' local model parameters instead of their local data. Then, in response to the uneven computing power of different users' edge devices, we propose a local model update algorithm based on adaptive computing power. Furthermore, a client selection algorithm based on test nodes is designed to reduce the negative influence of malicious clients on Co-Sense. Finally, we evaluate Co-Sense on three well-known public wireless datasets, including the gesture dataset, the activity dataset, and the gait dataset. Experimental results show that the sensing accuracy of Co-Sense is more than 10% higher than that of the most advanced wireless sensing models.},

	abstract     = {Map matching for cellular data is to transform a sequence of cell tower locations to a trajectory on a road map. It is an essential processing step for many applications, such as traffic optimization and human mobility analysis. However, most current map matching approaches are based on Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) that have heavy computation overhead to consider high-order cell tower information. This paper presents a fast map matching framework for cellular data, named as DMM, which adopts a recurrent neural network (RNN) to identify the most-likely trajectory of roads given a sequence of cell towers. Once the RNN model is trained, it can process cell tower sequences as making RNN inference, resulting in fast map matching speed. To transform DMM into a practical system, several challenges are addressed by developing a set of techniques, including spatial-aware representation of input cell tower sequences, an encoder-decoder framework for map matching model with variable-length input and output, and a reinforcement learning based model for optimizing the matched outputs. Extensive experiments on a large-scale anonymized cellular dataset reveal that DMM provides high map matching accuracy (precision 80.43% and recall 85.42%) and reduces the average inference time of HMM-based approaches by 46.58\texttimes{}.},

	abstract     = {The growing diversification of mobile services imposes requirements on network performance that are ever more stringent and heterogeneous. Network slicing aligns mobile network operation to this context, by enabling operators to isolate and customize network resources on a per-service basis. A key input for provisioning resources to slices is real-time information about the traffic demands generated by individual services. Acquiring such knowledge is however challenging, as legacy approaches based on in-depth inspection of traffic streams have high computational costs, which inflate with the widening adoption of encryption over data and control traffic. In this paper, we present a new approach to service-level demand estimation for slicing, which hinges on decomposition, i.e., the inference of per-service demands from traffic aggregates. By operating on total traffic volumes only, our approach overcomes the complexity and limitations of legacy traffic classification techniques, and provides a suitable input to recent 'Network Slice as a Service' (NSaaS) models. We implement decomposition through Microscope, a novel framework that uses deep learning to infer individual service demands from complex spatiotemporal features hidden in traffic aggregates. Microscope (i) transforms traffic data collected in irregular radio access deployments in a format suitable for convolutional learning, and (ii) can accommodate a variety of neural network architectures, including original 3D Deformable Convolutional Neural Networks (3D-DefCNNs) that we explicitly design for decomposition. Experiments with measurement data collected in an operational network demonstrate that Microscope accurately estimates per-service traffic demands with relative errors below 1.2%. Further, tests in practical NSaaS management use cases show that resource allocations informed by decomposition yield affordable costs for the mobile network operator.},

	abstract     = {Federated learning was proposed with an intriguing vision of achieving collaborative machine learning among numerous clients without uploading their private data to a cloud server. However, the conventional framework requires each client to leverage the full model for learning, which can be prohibitively inefficient for large-scale learning tasks and resource-constrained mobile devices. Thus, we proposed a submodel framework, where clients download only the needed parts of the full model, namely, submodels, and then upload the submodel updates. Nevertheless, the "position" of a client's truly required submodel corresponds to its private data, while the disclosure of the true position to the cloud server during interactions inevitably breaks the tenet of federated learning. To integrate efficiency and privacy, we designed a secure federated submodel learning scheme coupled with a private set union protocol as a cornerstone. The secure scheme features the properties of randomized response, secure aggregation, and Bloom filter, and endows each client with customized plausible deniability (in terms of local differential privacy) against the position of its desired submodel, thereby protecting private data. We further instantiated the scheme with Alibaba's e-commerce recommendation, implemented a prototype system, and extensively evaluated over 30-day Taobao user data. Empirical results demonstrate the feasibility and scalability of the proposed scheme as well as its remarkable advantages over the conventional federated learning framework, from model accuracy and convergency, practical communication, computation, and storage overhead.},

	abstract     = {Machine learning models, particularly reinforcement learning (RL), have demonstrated great potential in optimizing video streaming applications. However, the state-of-the-art solutions are limited to an "offline learning" paradigm, i.e., the RL models are trained in simulators and then are operated in real networks. As a result, they inevitably suffer from the simulation-to-reality gap, showing far less satisfactory performance under real conditions compared with simulated environment. In this work, we close the gap by proposing OnRL, an online RL framework for real-time mobile video telephony. OnRL puts many individual RL agents directly into the video telephony system, which make video bitrate decisions in real-time and evolve their models over time. OnRL then aggregates these agents to form a high-level RL model that can help each individual to react to unseen network conditions. Moreover, OnRL incorporates novel mechanisms to handle the adverse impacts of inherent video traffic dynamics, and to eliminate risks of quality degradation caused by the RL model's exploration attempts. We implement OnRL on a mainstream operational video telephony system, Alibaba Taobao-live. In a month-long evaluation with 543 hours of video sessions from 151 real-world mobile users, OnRL outperforms the prior algorithms significantly, reducing video stalling rate by 14.22% while maintaining similar video quality.},

Conventionally, the radios and processors used in these end devices are major power consumption that drains at the level of milliwatts (mWs). However, in recent decades, backscatter communication has dramatically reduced the power consumed by the radios in end devices to microwatts (Î¼Ws), and thus the processor remains the major bottleneck for energy optimization.In this paper, we propose a processor-free architecture as a novel design that allows the radio to interface directly with peripheral sensor chips for control and data collection, thereby separating the processors from the end device design to significantly reduce the energy consumed by end devices. The main problem is that the peripheral chips are designed to be accessed by the processor via a standard digital bus and they cannot communicate directly with the radio. In order to support such processor-free design, we propose radio-to-bus (R2B) as a novel communication paradigm that allows direct data exchange between a backscatter radio and the serial peripheral interface (SPI) bus. We implement the processor-free architecture in proof-of-concept prototypes and demonstrate that the power consumption decreases by 4.5 times compared with the conventional end device design.},

Contrary to popular view, 5G is not expected to be anchored on a single disruptive technology but rather supported by an amalgamation of multiple technologies. In essence, it is an evolution of several key technical advancements, whose synergy is expected to revolutionize the heterogeneity of use cases that can be "simultaneously" enabled by a single network. Such use cases range from throughput-focused mobile broadband (Gigabit peak rates) to latency/reliability-focused mission critical (e.g. augmented/virtual reality, autonomous driving) and density-focused massive connection (IoT) services. While physical layer advancements in the form of New Radio (NR) are an integral part of 5G, realizing the diverse use cases envisioned, will equally require innovation and flexible orchestration of its access, network and computing layers as well. This tutorial will provide an overview of some of these innovative ingredients that will constitute 5G, from the perspective of not just radio access network, but also core network and services/applications.},

Hence, there is a need to build a hybrid model combining both these attributes. In this work, we propose a hybrid malware detector that examines both the permissions and the traffic features to detect malicious Android samples. The proposed approach is based on the combination of Supervised Learning (KNN Algorithm) and Unsupervised Learning (K-Medoids Algorithm). Experimental results demonstrate that hybrid approach gives the overall detection accuracy of 91.98%, better than static and dynamic detection accuracies of 71.46% and 81.13% respectively.},

We show that vanilla MPTCP achieves these goals under static conditions but often results in performance worse than using the faster interface alone under dynamic scenarios.

CA performance prediction (CAPP) metrics are novel tools that address the problem of appropriate CA selection. However, most CAPP metrics depend upon a variety of factors such as the WMN topology, the type of CA scheme, and connectedness of the underlying graph. In this work, we propose an improved Channel Assignment Link-Weight Metric (iCALM) that is independent of these constraints. To the best of our knowledge, iCALM is the first universal CAPP metric for WMNs. To evaluate iCALM, we design two WMN topologies that conform to the attributes of real-world mesh network deployments, and run rigorous simulations in ns-3. We compare iCALM to four existing CAPP metrics, and demonstrate that it performs exceedingly well, regardless of the CA type, and the WMN layout.},

In these cases, devices in close proximity are deemed trustworthy while more distant devices are viewed as potential adversaries. Because radio waves are invisible, however, a user may believe a wireless device is communicating with a nearby device when in fact the user's device is communicating with a distant adversary. Researchers have previously proposed methods for multi-antenna devices to ascertain physical proximity with other devices, but devices with a single antenna, such as those commonly used in the Internet of Things, cannot take advantage of these techniques. We investigate a method for a single-antenna Wi-Fi device to quickly determine proximity with another Wi-Fi device. Our approach leverages the repeating nature Wi-Fi's preamble and the characteristics of a transmitting antenna's near field to detect proximity with high probability. Our method never falsely declares proximity at ranges longer than 14 cm.},

	abstract     = {Today's mobile users achieve unsatisfactory quality of experience mainly due to the large network distance to the centralized infrastructure. To improve users' experiences, caching at the wireless access points (APs) has been proposed for bringing the contents closer to users. However, the wireless content placement is challenging as the placement is affected by many realistic constraints, such as a large number of APs, interaction among neighboring APs, various local content popularities. In this paper, we study the wireless caching problem, i.e., which contents should be stored by which APs. First, we fulfil these constraints to formulate our problem and introduce an objective function that maximizes the total cache hit rate of all APs. Next, we prove the NP-hardness of the problem and propose a local distributed caching algorithm to address it. Furthermore, we provide a game theoretic perspective on the problem and prove that the proposed algorithm can converge to the Nash Equilibrium in polynomial time. Finally, we perform simulations on a real-world dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.},

In short, each AWDL node announces a sequence of Availability Windows (AWs) indicating its readiness to communicate with other AWDL nodes. An elected master node synchronizes these sequences. Outside the AWs, nodes can tune their Wi-Fi radio to a different channel to communicate with an access point, or could turn it off to save energy. Based on our analysis, we conduct experiments to study the master election process, synchronization accuracy, channel hopping dynamics, and achievable throughput. We conduct a preliminary security assessment and publish an open source Wireshark dissector for AWDL to nourish future work.},

	abstract     = {Visible Light Positioning (VLP) has attracted much research effort recently. Most existing VLP approaches require special designed light or receiver, collecting light information or strict user operation (e.g., horizontally holding mobile phone). This incurs a high deployment, maintenance and usage overhead. We present RainbowLight, a low cost ambient light 3D localization approach easy to deploy in today's buildings. Our key finding is that light through a chip of polarizer and birefringence material produces specific interference and light spectrum at different directions to the chip. We derive a model to characterize the relation for direction, light interference and spectrum. Exploiting the model, RainbowLight calculates the direction to a chip after taking a photo containing the chip. With multiple chips, RainbowLight designs a direction intersection based method to derive the location. We implement RainbowLight and extensively evaluate its performance in various environments. The evaluation results show that RainbowLight achieves an average localization error of 3.3 cm in 2D and 9.6 cm in 3D for light on, and an error of 7.4 cm in 2D and 20.5 cm in 3D for light off scenario in daytime.},

Specifically, WEBee synthesizes the time-domain signals by choosing appropriate frequency-domain components fed into the subcarriers of WiFi OFDM. WE-Bee can emulate the desired physical-layer ZigBee signals by manipulating only the data bits in WiFi packet payload, requiring neither hardware nor firmware changes in commodity technologies. Moreover, WEBee enables the parallel CTC, where one WiFi frame emulates two ZigBee frames simultaneously. To evaluate the performance, we implemented WEBee on commodity devices (the Atheros AR2425 WiFi card, BCM 4330 WiFi card and CC2420, CC2530 ZigBee devices). Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that WEBee can achieve the CTC between WiFi and ZigBee with a reliable throughput of 126Kbps in noisy environment, 16,000x faster than current state-of-the-art CTC methods.},

The open nature of the voice channel makes voice assistants difficult to secure, and hence exposed to various threats as demonstrated by security researchers. To defend against these threats, we present VAuth, the first system that provides continuous authentication for voice assistants. VAuth is designed to fit in widely-adopted wearable devices, such as eyeglasses, earphones/buds and necklaces, where it collects the body-surface vibrations of the user and matches it with the speech signal received by the voice assistant's microphone. VAuth guarantees the voice assistant to execute only the commands that originate from the voice of the owner. We have evaluated VAuth with 18 users and 30 voice commands and find it to achieve 97% detection accuracy and less than 0.1% false positive rate, regardless of VAuth's position on the body and the user's language, accent or mobility. VAuth successfully thwarts various practical attacks, such as replay attacks, mangled voice attacks, or impersonation attacks. It also incurs low energy and latency overheads and is compatible with most voice assistants.},

However, the current wearable programming model requires the developer to write a custom companion app for each wearable form factor; the companion app extends the smartphone display onto the wearable, relays user interactions from the wearable to the phone, and updates the wearable display as needed. The development effort required to write a companion app is significant and will not scale to an increasing diversity of form factors. This paper argues for a different programming model for wearable devices. The developer writes an application for the smartphone, but only specifies a UI design for the wearable. Our UIWear system abstracts a logical model of the smartphone GUI, re-tailors the GUI for the wearable device based on the specified UI design, and compiles it into a companion app that we call the UICompanion app. We implemented UIWear on Android smartphones, AndroidWear smartwatches, and Sony SmartEyeGlasses. We evaluate 20 developer-written companion apps from the AndroidWear category on Google Play against the UIWear-created UICompanion apps. The lines-of-code required for the developer to specify the UI design in UIWear is an order-of-magnitude smaller compared to the companion app lines-of-code. Further, in most cases, the UICompanion app performed comparably or better than the corresponding companion app both in terms of qualitative metrics, including latency and energy, and quantitative metrics, including look-and-feel.},

Through it, malware can wirelessly leak information without making network connections or emitting signals, such as sound, EMR, vibration, etc., that we can feel or are aware of. The covert channel is built on a communication method that we call NICScatter. NICScatter transmitter malware forces mobile devices, such as mobile phones, tablets or laptops, to reflect surrounding RF signals to covertly convey information. The operation is achieved by controlling the impedance of a device's wireless network interface card (NIC). Importantly, the operation requires no special privileges on current mobile OSs, which allows the malware to stealthily pass sensitive data to an attacker's nearby mobile device, which can then decode the signal and thus effectively gather the guarded data. Our experiments with different mobile devices show that the covert channel can achieve 1.6 bps and transmit as far as 2 meters. In a through-the-wall scenario, it can transmit up to 70 cm.},

	abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) has been a popular method to achieve distributed machine learning among numerous devices without sharing their data to a cloud server. FL aims to learn a shared global model with the participation of massive devices under the orchestration of a central server. However, mobile devices usually have limited communication bandwidth to transfer local updates to the central server. In addition, the data residing across devices is intrinsically statistically heterogeneous (i.e., non-IID data distribution). Learning a single global model may not work well for all devices participating in the FL under data heterogeneity. Such communication cost and data heterogeneity are two critical bottlenecks that hinder from applying FL in practice. Moreover, mobile devices usually have limited computational resources. Improving the inference efficiency of the learned model is critical to deploy deep learning applications on mobile devices. In this paper, we present Hermes - a communication and inference-efficient FL framework under data heterogeneity. To this end, each device finds a small subnetwork by applying the structured pruning; only the updates of these subnetworks will be communicated between the server and the devices. Instead of taking the average over all parameters of all devices as conventional FL frameworks, the server performs the average on only overlapped parameters across each subnetwork. By applying Hermes, each device can learn a personalized and structured sparse deep neural network, which can run efficiently on devices. Experiment results show the remarkable advantages of Hermes over the status quo approaches. Hermes achieves as high as 32.17% increase in inference accuracy, 3.48\texttimes{} reduction on the communication cost, 1.83\texttimes{} speedup in inference efficiency, and 1.8\texttimes{} savings on energy consumption.},

However, for real-world MIMO deployments, estimating the downlink wireless channel from each antenna on the base station to every client device is a critical bottleneck, especially for the widely used frequency duplexed designs that cannot utilize reciprocity. Typically, this channel estimation requires explicit feedback from client devices and is prohibitive for large antenna deployments. In this paper, we present FIRE, a system that uses an end-to-end machine learning approach to enable accurate channel estimation without requiring any feedback from client devices. FIRE is interpretable, accurate, and has low compute overhead. We show that FIRE can successfully support MIMO transmissions in a real-world testbed and achieves SNR improvement over 10 dB in MIMO transmissions compared to the current state-of-the-art.},

However, existing works use only the coarse-grained packet-level information for cross-technology modulation, suffering from a low throughput (e.g., 10bps). Our approach, called BlueBee, aims at achieving much higher CTC throughput thus extends CTC applications. We pro- poses a new direction by emulating legitimate ZigBee frames using a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) radio. Uniquely, BlueBee achieves dual-standard compliance (i.e., BLE and ZigBee) and transparency by selecting only the payload of Bluetooth frames, requiring neither hardware nor firmware changes at the BLE senders and ZigBee receivers. Our implementation on commodity device testbeds shows that BlueBee can achieve a more than 99% accuracy and a through- put 10,000x faster than the state-of-the-art CTC reported so far. In addition, we show a demo of using BlueBee on a smartphone to control several smart light bulbs a ached with ZigBee radio.},

In this demo, we propose the first SmartWatch-based American sign language (ASL) recognition system, which is more comfortable, portable and user-friendly and offers accessibility anytime, anywhere. This system is based on the intuitive idea that each sign has its specific motion pattern which can be transformed into unique gyroscope and accelerometer signals and then analyzed and learned by using Long-Short term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM-RNN) trained with connectionist temporal classification (CTC). In this way, signs and context information can be correctly recognized based on an off-the-shelf device (eg. SmartWatch, Smartphone). The experiments show that, in the Known user split task, our system reaches an average word error rate of 7.29% to recognize 73 sentences formed by 103 ASL signs and achieves detection ratio up to 93.7% for a single sign. The result also shows our system has a good adaptation, even including new users, it can achieve an average word error rate of 21.6% at the sentence level and reach an average detection ratio of 79.4%. Moreover, our system performs real time ASL translation, outputting the speech within 1.69 seconds for a sentence of 12 signs in average.},

This paper introduces TagScan, a system that can identify the material type and image the horizontal cut of a target simultaneously with cheap commercial off the-shelf (COTS) RFID devices. The key intuition is that different materials and target sizes cause different amounts of phase and RSS (Received Signal Strength) changes when radio frequency (RF) signal penetrates through the target. Multiple challenges need to be addressed before we can turn the idea into a functional system including (i) indoor environments exhibit rich multipath which breaks the linear relationship between the phase change and the propagation distance inside a target; (ii) without knowing either material type or target size, trying to obtain these two information simultaneously is challenging; and (iii) stitching pieces of the propagation distances inside a target for an image estimate is non-trivial. We propose solutions to all the challenges and evaluate the system's performance in three different environments. TagScan is able to achieve higher than 94% material identification accuracies for 10 liquids and differentiate even very similar objects such as Coke and Pepsi. TagScan can accurately estimate the horizontal cut images of more than one target behind a wall.},

Our quantitative, performance-driven design study makes two contributions. First, we show that the QoE achievable for high-quality VR applications on today's mobile hardware and wireless networks via local rendering or offloading is about 10X away from the acceptable QoE, yet waiting for future mobile hardware or next-generation wireless networks (e.g. 5G) is unlikely to help, because of power limitation and the higher CPU utilization needed for processing packets under higher data rate. Second, we present Furion, a VR framework that enables high-quality, immersive mobile VR on today's mobile devices and wireless networks. Furion exploits a key insight about the VR workload that foreground interactions and background environment have contrasting predictability and rendering workload, and employs a split renderer architecture running on both the phone and the server. Supplemented with video compression, use of panoramic frames, and parallel decoding on multiple cores on the phone, we demonstrate Furion can support high-quality VR apps on today's smartphones over WiFi, with under 14ms latency and 60 FPS (the phone display refresh rate).},

The key idea of MVP is to extract magnetic fingerprints from geomagnetic field anomalies. By comparing the measured magnetic field against a magnetic map, positioning can be achieved without GNSS signals. Our proposed matching algorithm allows MVP to provide 5.14 m positioning accuracy. We conducted large-scale real-road experiments for 36 months in two countries and 56 tunnels to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system.

Unfortunately, most of these designs demand a subject human body to be relatively static, rendering them very inconvenient to adopt in practice where body movements occur frequently. In particular, radio-frequency (RF) based contact-free sensing can be severely affected by body movements that overwhelm vital signs. To this end, we introduce MoVi-Fi as a motion-robust vital signs monitoring system, capable of recovering fine-grained vital signs waveform in a contact-free manner. Being a pure software system, MoVi-Fi can be built on top of virtually any commercial-grade radars. What inspires our design is that RF reflections caused by vital signs, albeit weak, do not totally disappear but are composited with other motion-incurred reflections in a nonlinear manner. As nonlinear blind source separation is inherently hard, MoVi-Fi innovatively employs deep contrastive learning to tackle the problem; this self-supervised method requires no ground truth in training, and it exploits contrastive signal features to distinguish vital signs from body movements. Our experiments with 12 subjects and 80hour data demonstrate that MoVi-Fi accurately recovers vital signs waveform under severe body movements.},

This paper proposes an RF-Camera system by fusing RFID and Computer Vision (CV) techniques, which is the first work to recognize the human gestural interactions with physical objects in multi-subject and multi-object scenarios. In RF-Camera, we first propose a dimension reduction method to transform the subject's 3D hand trajectory captured by depth camera to a 2D image, using which the subject's gesture can be recognized. We also propose a method to extract the facial image of target subject from an image that may contain irrelevant subjects, thereby further recognizing his/her identity. Finally, we model the physical movements of the held object's tag and further predict the tag phase data, by comparing which with real phase data of each tag human-object matching can be discovered. When implementing RF-Camera, three technical challenges need to be addressed. (i) To remove noisy data corresponding to irrelevant actions from raw sensing data, we propose a state transition diagram to determine the boundary of effective data. (ii) To predict phase data of the held target tag with unknown hand-tag offset, we quantify target tag trajectory by adding a variable hand-tag vector to captured hand trajectory. (iii) To ensure high reading rates of target tags in tag-dense scenarios, we propose a CV-assisted RFID scheduling method, in which analytics on CV data can help schedule RFID readings. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of RF-Camera. Experimental results demonstrate that RF-Camera can recognize the gestural actions, human identity and human-object matching with an average accuracy higher than 90% in most cases.},

	abstract     = {On-device deep learning (DL) inference has attracted vast interest. Mobile CPUs are the most common hardware for on-device inference and many inference frameworks have been developed for them. Yet, due to the hardware complexity, DL inference on mobile CPUs suffers from two common issues: the poor performance scalability on the asymmetric multiprocessor, and energy inefficiency.We identify the root causes are improper task partitioning and unbalanced task distribution for the poor scalability, and unawareness of model behaviour for energy inefficiency. Based on that, we propose a novel technique called AsyMo for the thread pool implementation of DL frameworks to solve the two issues. The key design principle is to leverage the execution determinism of DL inference, and build an optimal execution plan offline by jointly considering model structures and hardware characteristics. For performance scalability, AsyMo implements cost-model-directed partitioning and asymmetry-aware task scheduling to properly divide and fairly schedule tasks on asymmetric CPUs. For energy saving, AsyMo determines the least-energy cost frequency based on data reuse rate of a model.AsyMo is evaluated on different models and DL frameworks. All gain substantial improvement. For example, AsyMo shows up to 46% performance and 37% energy-efficiency improvement for convolution-dominant models, and up to 97% performance and 1.22\texttimes{} energy-efficiency improvement for fully-connect-dominant models, compared to an optimized TensorFlow on off-the-shelf mobile CPUs.},

In this work, we present ParaMax, a MIMO detector architecture that for the first time brings to bear physics-inspired parallel tempering algorithmic techniques [28, 50, 67] on this class of problems. ParaMax can achieve near optimal maximum-likelihood (ML) throughput performance in the Large MIMO regime, Massive MIMO systems where the base station has additional RF chains, to approach the number of base station antennas, in order to support even more parallel spatial streams. ParaMax is able to achieve a near ML-BER performance up to 160 \texttimes{} 160 and 80 \texttimes{} 80 Large MIMO for low-order modulations such as BPSK and QPSK, respectively, only requiring less than tens of processing elements. With respect to Massive MIMO systems, in 12 \texttimes{} 24 MIMO with 16-QAM at SNR 16 dB, ParaMax achieves 330 Mbits/s near-optimal system throughput with 4--8 processing elements per subcarrier, which is approximately 1.4\texttimes{} throughput than linear detector-based Massive MIMO systems.},

To alleviate this issue, this work presents WiBeacon, which repurposes ubiquitously deployed WiFi access points (AP) into virtual BLE beacons via only moderate software upgrades. Specifically, a WiBeacon-enabled AP can broadcast elaborately designed WiFi packets that could be recognized as iBeacon-compatible location identifiers by unmodified mobile BLE devices. This offers fast deployment of BLE LBS with zero additional hardware costs and low maintenance burdens. WiBeacon is carefully integrated with native WiFi services, retaining transparency to WiFi clients. We implement WiBeacon on commodity WiFi APs (with various chipsets such as Qualcomm, Broadcom, and MediaTek) and extensively evaluate it across various scenarios, including a real commercial application for courier check-ins. During the two-week pilot study, WiBeacon provides reliable services, i.e., as robust as conventional BLE beacons, for 697 users with 150 types of smartphones.},

	abstract     = {Instant delivery is an important urban service in recent years because of the increasing demand. An important issue for delivery platforms is to keep updating the status of couriers especially the real-time locations, which is challenging when they are in an indoor environment. We argue the previous indoor localization techniques cannot be applied in the instant delivery scenario because they require extra deployed infrastructures and extensive labor work. In this work, we perform the couriers' indoor localization transparently in a predictive manner without extra actions of couriers by existing data from the platform including order progress reports and couriers' trajectories. Specifically, we present TransLoc to predict couriers' indoor locations by addressing two challenges including uncertain reporting behaviors and uncertain indoor mobility behaviors. Our key idea lies in two insights (i) couriers' behaviors are consistent in indoor/outdoor environments; (ii) localization, as a spatial inference problem, could be converted to a temporal inference problem. We evaluate TransLoc on 565 couriers from an instant delivery company, which improves baselines by at most 72%, and achieves a competitive result compared to a label-extensive approach. As a case study, we apply TransLoc to optimize the order dispatching strategy, which reduces the delivery time by 24%.},

	abstract     = {Despite the soaring use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in mobile applications, uniformly sustaining high-performance inference on mobile has been elusive due to the excessive computational demands of modern CNNs and the increasing diversity of deployed devices. A popular alternative comprises offloading CNN processing to powerful cloud-based servers. Nevertheless, by relying on the cloud to produce outputs, emerging mission-critical and high-mobility applications, such as drone obstacle avoidance or interactive applications, can suffer from the dynamic connectivity conditions and the uncertain availability of the cloud. In this paper, we propose SPINN, a distributed inference system that employs synergistic device-cloud computation together with a progressive inference method to deliver fast and robust CNN inference across diverse settings. The proposed system introduces a novel scheduler that co-optimises the early-exit policy and the CNN splitting at run time, in order to adapt to dynamic conditions and meet user-defined service-level requirements. Quantitative evaluation illustrates that SPINN outperforms its state-of-the-art collaborative inference counterparts by up to 2\texttimes{} in achieved throughput under varying network conditions, reduces the server cost by up to 6.8\texttimes{} and improves accuracy by 20.7% under latency constraints, while providing robust operation under uncertain connectivity conditions and significant energy savings compared to cloud-centric execution.},

Currently used low-power protocols such as Zigbee and Bluetooth Low Energy have limited communication range, whereas long-range communication strategies used in cellular and satellite networks are heavy on energy consumption. Methods that use narrow-band communication such as LoRa, SigFox, and NB-IoT have low spectral efficiency, leading to scalability issues. The goal of this work is to develop a communication framework that can satisfy the following requirements: (1) Increased battery life, (2) Longer communication range, (3) Scalability in a wireless network. In this work, we propose, design, and prototype WiChronos, a communication paradigm that encodes information in the time interval between two narrowband symbols in order to drastically reduce the energy consumption in a wide area network with a large number of senders. We leverage the low data-rate and relaxed latency requirements of such applications to achieve the desired features identified above. Based on our prototype using off-the-shelf components, WiChronos achieves an impressive 60% improvement in battery life compared to state-of-the-art LPWAN technologies at distances of over 800 meters.

In this paper, we make an in-depth study of ANR and SNR at scale based on fine-grained system-level traces crowdsourced from 30,000 Android systems. We find that ANR and SNR occur prevalently on all the studied 15 hardware models, and better hardware does not seem to relieve the problem. Moreover, as Android evolves from version 7.0 to 9.0, there are fewer ANR events but more SNR events. Most importantly, we uncover multifold root causes of ANR and SNR and pinpoint the largest inefficiency which roots in Android's flawed implementation of Write Amplification Mitigation (WAM). We design a practical approach to eliminating this largest root cause; after large-scale deployment, it reduces almost all (&gt;99%) ANR and SNR caused by WAM while only decreasing 3% of the data write speed. In addition, we document important lessons we have learned from this study, and have also released our measurement code/data to the research community.},

Unfortunately, establishing and managing highly directional beams in THz networks is challenging as links lack the "pseudo-omni" reception capability of lower bands and the product of AP-client beam resolution is high due to narrow beams of only a few degrees. In this paper, we present One-shot Path discovEry with a THz RAinbow (OPERA), a novel system that identifies dominant paths between the AP and all clients in order to efficiently steer directional beams. The key idea is to embed path direction into the inherent characteristics of signals traveling along each path. To do so, we exploit a single leaky wave antenna and create a THz Rainbow. A THz Rainbow transmission consists of distinct signals with unique spectral characteristics across the angular domain. Leveraging the spatial-spectral signatures in the THz Rainbow, all receivers can correlate the measured signal with the known transmission signatures to discover the sender's path directions in one-shot. Our experiments demonstrate that OPERA achieves average direction estimates within 2Â° of ground truth for LOS and reflected paths.},

We found that straightforwardly activating all the arrays may even hamper network performance. To fully exploit the APA's potential, we propose X-Array, which jointly selects the arrays and beams, and applies a dynamic co-phasing mechanism to ensure different arrays' signals enhance each other. X-Array also incorporates a link recovery mechanism to identify alternative arrays/beams that can efficiently recover the link from outage.

As a remedy, we design and develop an LAA-LTE transmitter based on a software-defined radio system proposing lightweight but effective Wi-Fi frame detection with which an LAA-LTE device can capture a Wi-Fi preamble by only using LTE's own time-domain samples.

Our system innovatively re-uses widely available WiFi signals to capture the unique physiological characteristics rooted in respiratory motions for continuous authentication. Different from existing continuous authentication approaches having limited applicable scenarios due to their dependence on restricted user behaviors (e.g., keystrokes and gaits) or dedicated sensing infrastructures, our approach can be easily integrated into any existing WiFi infrastructure to provide non-invasive continuous authentication independent of user behaviors. Specifically, we extract representative features leveraging waveform morphology analysis and fuzzy wavelet transformation of respiration signals derived from the readily available channel state information (CSI) of WiFi. A respiration-based user authentication scheme is developed to accurately identify users and reject spoofers. Extensive experiments involving 20 subjects demonstrate that the proposed system can achieve a high authentication success rate of over 93% and robustly defend against various types of attacks.},

In our demonstrator, we show how our Linux system synchronizes to an existing AWDL cluster or takes over the master role itself.

Moreover, the importance of personal networks at many stages of the story will be highlighted. I will consider why the first Arpanet service node was sited at UCL, how it grew to provide an international heterogeneous interconnection service until the late '80s, and how this differed from other European developments. This will include the governance put in place, the role of the Open Systems Interconnection rise and fall in Europe, and the growth of multi- agency support on both sides of the Atlantic. In parallel with the development of a UK-US service, an International Collaboration Board (ICB) was formed that fostered unclassified collaborations between certain European and American NATO defence departments. While the ICB was not very significant technically, how its success initiated broader US-European Internet extension will be described. Our emphasis on application services to the '90s will be outlined - message, directory, security and multimedia conferencing.

In this work, we design and implement UbiG - a mmWave wireless access network - that can deliver ubiquitous gigabits per second wireless access consistently to the commercial-off-the-shelf IEEE 802.11ad devices. UbiG has two key design components: (1) a fast probing based beam alignment algorithm that can identify the best beam consistently with guaranteed latency in a mmWave link, and the algorithm scales well even with a very large number of beams; and (2) an infrastructure-side predictive ranking based fast access point switching algorithm to ensure seamless gigabits per second connectivity under mobility and blockage in a dense mmWave deployment. Our IEEE 802.11ad testbed experiments show that UbiG performs close to an "Oracle" solution that instantaneously knows the best beam and access point for gigabits per second data transmission to users.},

This paper provides an in-depth characterization of the implications of international data roaming within Europe. We build a unique roaming measurement platform using 16 different mobile networks deployed in six countries across Europe. Using this platform, we measure different aspects of international roaming in 3G and 4G networks, including mobile network configuration, performance characteristics, and content discrimination. We find that operators adopt common approaches to implementing roaming, resulting in additional latency penalties of â¼60 ms or more, depending on geographical distance. Considering content accessibility, roaming poses additional constraints that leads to only minimal deviations when accessing content in the original country. However, geographical restrictions in the visited country make the picture more complicated and less intuitive.},

	abstract     = {User authentication on smartphones must satisfy both security and convenience, an inherently difficult balancing art. Apple's FaceID is arguably the latest of such efforts, at the cost of additional hardware (e.g., dot projector, flood illuminator and infrared camera). We propose a novel user authentication system EchoPrint, which leverages acoustics and vision for secure and convenient user authentication, without requiring any special hardware. EchoPrint actively emits almost inaudible acoustic signals from the earpiece speaker to "illuminate" the user's face and authenticates the user by the unique features extracted from the echoes bouncing off the 3D facial contour. To combat changes in phone-holding poses thus echoes, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained to extract reliable acoustic features, which are further combined with visual facial landmark locations to feed a binary Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for final authentication. Because the echo features depend on 3D facial geometries, EchoPrint is not easily spoofed by images or videos like 2D visual face recognition systems. It needs only commodity hardware, thus avoiding the extra costs of special sensors in solutions like FaceID. Experiments with 62 volunteers and non-human objects such as images, photos, and sculptures show that EchoPrint achieves 93.75% balanced accuracy and 93.50% F-score, while the average precision is 98.05%, and no image/video based attack is observed to succeed in spoofing.},

In this paper, we provide a first investigation of this trade-off via an empirical study of resource management efficiency in network slicing. Building on substantial measurement data collected in an operational mobile network (i) we quantify the efficiency gap introduced by non-reconfigurable allocation strategies of different kinds of resources, from radio access to the core of the network, and (ii) we quantify the advantages of their dynamic orchestration at different timescales.

Hence, they are an attractive foundation for environmental sensing. Although RFID-based sensors have been studied in the research literature and are also available commercially, manufacturing them has been a technically-challenging task that is typically undertaken only by experienced researchers. In this paper, we show how even hobbyists can transform commodity RFID tags into sensors by physically altering (`hacking') them using COTS sensors, a pair of scissors, and clear adhesive tape. Importantly, this requires no change to commercial RFID readers. We also propose a new legacy-compatible tag reading protocol called Differential Minimum Response Threshold (DMRT) that is robust to the changes in an RF environment. To validate our vision, we develop RFID-based sensors for illuminance, temperature, touch, and gestures. We believe that our approach has the potential to open up the field of batteryless backscatter-based RFID sensing to the research community, making it an exciting area for future work.},

Unfortunately, establishing multi-stream directional links can be a high overhead procedure as the search space increases with the number of spatial streams and the product of AP-client beam resolution. In this paper, we present MUlti-stream beam-Training for mm-wavE networks (MUTE) a novel system that leverages channel sparsity, GHz-scale sampling rate, and the knowledge of mm-Wave RF codebook beam patterns to construct a set of candidate beams for multi-stream beam steering. In 60 GHz WLANs, the AP establishes and maintains a directional link with every client through periodic beam training. MUTE repurposes these beam acquisition sweeps to estimate the Power Delay Profile (PDP) of each beam with zero additional overhead. Coupling PDP estimates with beam pattern knowledge, MUTE selects a set of candidate beams that capture diverse or ideally orthogonal paths to obtain maximum stream separability. Our experiments demonstrate that MUTE achieves 90% of the maximum achievable aggregate rate while incurring only 0.04% of exhaustive search's training overhead.},

	abstract     = {The advances in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology have empowered mobile operators to deploy LTE base stations (BSs) on UAVs, and provide on-demand, adaptive connectivity to hotspot venues as well as emergency scenarios. However, today's evolved packet core (EPC) that orchestrates the LTE RAN faces fundamental limitations in catering to such a challenging, wireless and mobile UAV environment, particularly in the presence of multiple BSs (UAVs). In this work, we argue for and propose an alternate, radical edge EPC design, called SkyCore that pushes the EPC functionality to the extreme edge of the core network - collapses the EPC into a single, light-weight, self-contained entity that is co-located with each of the UAV BS. SkyCore incorporates elements that are designed to address the unique challenges facing such a distributed design in the UAV environment, namely the resource-constraints of UAV platforms, and the distributed management of pronounced UAV and UE mobility. We build and deploy a fully functional version of SkyCore on a two-UAV LTE network and showcase its (i) ability to interoperate with commercial LTE BSs as well as smartphones, (ii) support for both hotspot and standalone multi-UAV deployments, and (iii) superior control and data plane performance compared to other EPC variants in this environment.},

	abstract     = {Cross-technology Communication (CTC) is a key technique to explore the full capacity of heterogeneous wireless. The latest CTC designs explore the PHY-layer to reach the standards' maximum rate, but leaving a critical gap to practicality -- existing PHY-layer CTCs are commonly transmitter-side techniques requiring a high-end transmitter (with a high degree of freedom in signal manipulation) to emulate the receiver signal closely. This inherently limits the reverse direction (low-end to high-end) communication. We present XBee, a unique receiver-side CTC that fills in the gap and makes a critical step towards achieving CTC bidirectionality. XBee is demonstrated as a ZigBee to BLE communication, where the key innovation lies in the unique mechanism of cross-technology decoding, or cross-decoding in short, which interprets a ZigBee frame only by carefully observing the bit patterns obtained at the BLE receiver. Technically, XBee counterintuitively explores the sampling offset to overcome the intrinsic challenge due to BLE's narrower bandwidth (1MHz) than ZigBee (2MHz). Extensive implementation and evaluation on USRP and commodity devices reach 250 kbps under 85% reliability, a 15,000x improvement over state-of-the-art ZigBee to BLE communication, and comparable with the latest PHY-layer CTCs to achieve CTC bidirectionality.},

Three key goals on imperceptible, high rate, and reliable communication are desirable but conflicting, and existing solutions usually made a trade-off among them. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of ChromaCode, a screen-camera communication system that achieves all three goals simultaneously. In our design, we consider for the first time color space for perceptually uniform lightness modifications. On this basis, we design an outcome-based adaptive embedding scheme, which adapts to both pixel lightness and regional texture. Last, we propose a concatenated code scheme for robust coding and devise multiple techniques to overcome various screen-camera channel errors. Our prototype and experiments demonstrate that ChromaCode achieves remarkable raw throughputs of &gt;700 kbps, data goodputs of 120 kbps with BER of 0.05, and with fully imperceptible flicker for viewing proved by user study, which significantly outperforms previous works.},

	abstract     = {An increasing amount of mobile analytics is performed on data that is procured in a real-time fashion to make real-time decisions. Such tasks include simple reporting on streams to sophisticated model building. However, the practicality of these analyses are impeded in several domains because they are faced with a fundamental trade-off between data collection latency and analysis accuracy. In this paper, we first study this trade-off in the context of a specific domain, Cellular Radio Access Networks (RAN). We find that the trade-off can be resolved using two broad, general techniques: intelligent data grouping and task formulations that leverage domain characteristics. Based on this, we present CellScope, a system that applies a domain specific formulation and application of Multi-task Learning (MTL) to RAN performance analysis. It uses three techniques: feature engineering to transform raw data into effective features, a PCA inspired similarity metric to group data from geographically nearby base stations sharing performance commonalities, and a hybrid online-offline model for efficient model updates. Our evaluation shows that CellScope's accuracy improvements over direct application of ML range from 2.5\texttimes{} to 4.4\texttimes{} while reducing the model update overhead by up to 4.8\texttimes{}. We have also used CellScope to analyze an LTE network of over 2 million subscribers, where it reduced troubleshooting efforts by several magnitudes. We then apply the underlying techniques in CellScope to another domain specific problem, mobile phone energy bug diagnosis, and show that the techniques are general.},

These systems usually run multiple applications concurrently and their available resources at runtime are dynamic due to events such as starting new applications, closing existing applications, and application priority changes. In this paper, we present NestDNN, a framework that takes the dynamics of runtime resources into account to enable resource-aware multi-tenant on-device deep learning for mobile vision systems. NestDNN enables each deep learning model to offer flexible resource-accuracy trade-offs. At runtime, it dynamically selects the optimal resource-accuracy trade-off for each deep learning model to fit the model's resource demand to the system's available runtime resources. In doing so, NestDNN efficiently utilizes the limited resources in mobile vision systems to jointly maximize the performance of all the concurrently running applications. Our experiments show that compared to the resource-agnostic status quo approach, NestDNN achieves as much as 4.2% increase in inference accuracy, 2.0\texttimes{} increase in video frame processing rate and 1.7\texttimes{} reduction on energy consumption.},

The existing approaches of parallel backscatter are based on a common assumption, i.e. the states of the collided signals are distinguishable from each other in either the time domain or the IQ (the In-phase and Quadrature) domain. We in this paper disclose the superclustering phenomenon, which invalidates that assumption and seriously affects the decoding performance. Then we propose an interstellar travelling model to capture the bursty Gaussian process of a collided signal. Based on this model, we design Hubble, a reliable signal processing approach to support parallel backscatter in the wild. Hubble addresses several technical challenges: (i) a novel scheme based on Pearson's Chi-Square test to extract the collided signals' combined states, (ii) a Markov driven method to capture the law of signal state transitions, and (iii) error correction schemes to guarantee the reliability of parallel decoding. Theoretically, Hubble is able to decode all the backscattered data, as long as the signals are detectable by the receiver. The experiment results demonstrate that the median throughput of Hubble is $11.7times$ higher than that of the state-of-the-art approach.},

	abstract     = {State-of-the-art RFID localization systems fall under two categories. The first category operates with off-the-shelf narrowband RFID tags but makes restrictive assumptions on the environment or the tag's movement patterns. The second category does not make such restrictive assumptions; however, it requires designing new ultra-wideband hardware for RFIDs and uses the large bandwidth to directly compute a tag's 3D location. Hence, while the first category is restrictive, the second one requires replacing the billions of RFIDs already produced and deployed annually. This paper presents RFind, a new technology that brings the benefits of ultra-wideband localization to the billions of RFIDs in today's world. RFind does not require changing today's passive narrowband RFID tags. Instead, it leverages their underlying physical properties to emulate a very large bandwidth and uses it for localization. Our empirical results demonstrate that RFind can emulate over 220MHz of bandwidth on tags designed with a communication bandwidth of only tens to hundreds of kHz, while remaining compliant with FCC regulations. This, combined with a new super-resolution algorithm over this bandwidth, enables RFind to perform 3D localization with sub-centimeter accuracy in each of the x/y/z dimensions, without making any restrictive assumptions on the tag's motion or the environment.},

	abstract     = {60 GHz millimeter-wave networking has emerged as the next frontier technology to provide multi-Gbps wireless connectivity. However, the intrinsic directionality and limited field-of-view of 60 GHz antennas make the links extremely sensitive to user mobility and orientation change. Hence, seamless coverage, even at room level, becomes challenging. In this paper, we propose Pia, a robust 60 GHz network architecture that can provide seamless coverage and mobility support at multi-Gbps bitrate. Pia comprises multiple cooperating access points (APs). It leverages the pose information on mobile clients to proactively select the AP and manage multi-link spatial reuse. These decisions require a model of the pose/location of the APs and ambient reflectors. We address these challenges through a set of AP-pose sensing and compressive angle estimation algorithms that fuse the pose measurement with link quality measurement on the client. We have implemented Pia using commodity 60 GHz platforms. Our experiments show that Pia reduces the occurrence of link outage by 6.3x and improves the spatial sharing capacity by 76%, compared to conventional schemes that only use in-band information for adaptation.},

A key component in a multipath system such as MPTCP is the scheduler, which determines how to distribute the traffic over multiple paths. In this paper, we propose DEMS, a new multipath scheduler aiming at reducing the data chunk download time. DEMS consists of three key design decisions: (1) being aware of the chunk boundary and strategically decoupling the paths for chunk delivery, (2) ensuring simultaneous subflow completion at the receiver side, and (3) allowing a path to trade a small amount of redundant data for performance. We have implemented DEMS on smartphones and evaluated it over both emulated and real cellular/WiFi networks. DEMS is robust to diverse network conditions and brings significant performance boost compared to the default MPTCP scheduler (e.g., median download time reduction of 33%--48% for fetching files and median loading time reduction of 6%--43% for fetching web pages), and even more benefits compared to other state-of-the-art schedulers.},

In this paper, we present BiPass to break this limitation.With the help of full duplex capable relays, weenable simultaneous bidirectional in-band cut-through transmissions between two far apart nodes, so they can do full duplex communications as if they were within each other's transmission range.To design such a system, we analyze interference patterns and propose a loop-back interference cancellation strategy. We identify the power amplification problem at relay nodes and develop an algorithm to solve it. We also develop a routing algorithm, an opportunistic forwarding scheme, and a real-time feedback strategy to leverage this system in ad-hoc networks.To evaluate the real world performance of BiPass, we build a prototype and conduct experiments using software defined radios. We show that BiPass can achieve 1.6x median throughput gain over state-of-the-art one-way cut-through systems, and 4.09x gain over the decode-and-forward scheme. Our simulations further reveal that even when the data traffic is not bidirectional, BiPass has 1.36x throughput gain and 47% delay reduction overone-way cut-through systemsin large networks.},

Since CPUs and magnetometers are readily available components in mobile devices, MagneComm eliminates the requirement for special hardware and complements existing near-field communication protocols by providing additional bandwidth. We systematically analyze the characteristics of magnetic signals of CPUs and facilitate MagneComm with one-way communication, full-duplex communication, and multi-transmitter schemes in accordance with the hardware availability on devices.

PCube leverages the reception diversities of multiple receiving antennas of a gateway and scales the concurrent transmissions of a large number of LoRa nodes, even exceeding the number of receiving antennas at a gateway. As a phase-based parallel decoder, PCube provides a new dimension to resolve collisions and supports more concurrent transmissions by complementing time and frequency based parallel decoders. PCube is implemented and evaluated with synchronized software defined radios and off-the-shelf LoRa nodes in both indoors and outdoors. Results demonstrate that PCube can substantially outperform state-of-the-art works in terms of aggregated throughput by 4.9\texttimes{} and the number of concurrent nodes by up to 5\texttimes{}. More importantly, PCube scales well with the number of receiving antennas of a gateway, which is promising to break the barrier of concurrent transmissions.},

LoRa links in practice, however, experience high dynamics in various environments. When the SNR falls below the threshold (e.g., in the building), a LoRa device disconnects from the network. We propose Falcon, which addresses the link dynamics by enabling data transmission for very low SNR or even disconnected LoRa links. At the heart of Falcon, we reveal that low SNR LoRa links that cannot deliver packets can still introduce interference to other LoRa transmissions. Therefore, Falcon transmits data bits on the low SNR link by selectively interfering with other LoRa transmissions. We address practical challenges in Falcon design. We propose a low-power channel activity detection method to detect other LoRa transmissions for selective interference. To interfere with the so-called interference-resilient LoRa, we accurately estimate the time and frequency offsets on LoRa packets and propose an adaptive frequency adjusting strategy to maximize the interference. We implement Falcon, all using commercial off-the-shelf LoRa devices, and extensively evaluate its performance. The results show that Falcon can provide reliable communication links for disconnected LoRa devices and achieves the SNR boundary upto 7.5 dB lower than that of standard LoRa.},

	abstract     = {Arterial blood pressure (ABP) monitoring using wearables has emerged as a promising approach to empower users with self-monitoring for effective diagnosis and control of hypertension. However, existing schemes mainly monitor ABP at discrete time intervals, involve some form of user effort, have insufficient accuracy, and require collecting sufficient training data for model development. To tackle these problems, we propose Crisp-BP, a novel ABP monitoring system leveraging the PPG sensor available in commercial wrist-worn devices (e.g., smartwatches or fitness trackers). It enables continuous, accurate, user-independent ABP monitoring and requires no behavior changes during collecting PPG data. The basic idea is to illuminate a skin/tissue, measure the light absorption, and characterize ABP-related blood volume change in the artery. To obtain accurate measurements and relieve the pain of training data collection, we use an arterial pulse extraction method that removes interference caused by capillary pulses. Moreover, we design a contact pressure estimation method to combat the deficiency of PPG waveform being sensitive to the contact pressure between the sensor and the skin. In addition, we leverage the great power of Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory and design a hybrid neural network model to enable user-independent ABP monitoring, so that users do not have to provide training data for model development. Furthermore, we propose a transfer learning method that first extracts general knowledge from online PPG data, then use it to improve the learning of a new model on our target problem. Extensive experiments with 35 participants demonstrate that Crisp-BP obtains the average estimation error of 0.86 mmHg and 1.67 mmHg and the standard deviation error of 6.55 mmHg and 7.31 mmHg for diastolic pressure and systolic pressure, respectively. These errors are within the acceptable range regulated by the FDA's AAMI protocol, which allows average errors of up to 5 mmHg and a standard deviation of up to 8 mmHg. Our results demonstrate that Crisp-BP is promising for improving the diagnosis and control of hypertension as it provides continuousness, comfort, convenience, and accuracy.},

We propose a system with configurable knobs and show how to achieve the stability of the system using a Lyapunov-based control strategy. In our setup, heterogeneous edge devices (e.g. mobile phones, cameras) stream videos to a low-resource edge server where frames are selectively processed in batches and the detection results are sent to the cloud or to the edge device for further application-aware processing.

These standards have been widely adopted for many applications, such as mobile payments, advertisements, social sharing, admission control, and so on. Recently, considerable demands require the integration of these two codes (barcode and NFC code) into a single tag for the functional complementation. To achieve the goal of "one tag, two codes" (OTTC), this work proposes CoilCode, which takes advantage of the printed electronics to fuse an NFC coil antenna into a QR code on a single layer. The proposed code could be identified by cameras and NFC readers. With the use of the conductive inks, QR code and NFC code have become an essential part of each other: the modules of the QR code facilitate the NFC chip in harvesting energy from the magnetic field, while the NFC antenna itself represents bits of the QR code. Compared to the prior dual-layer OTTC, CoilCode is more compact, cost-effective, flimsy, flexible, and environment-friendly, and also reduces the fabrication complexity considerably. We prototyped hundreds of CoilCodes and conducted comprehensive evaluations (across 4 models of NFC chips and 8 kinds of NFC readers under 13 different system configurations). CoilCode demonstrates high-quality identification results for QR code and NFC functions on a wide range of inputs and under different distortion effects.},

Millimetro addresses this challenge by re-using existing automotive radars that operate at mmWave frequency where plentiful bandwidth is available to ensure high accuracy and low latency. We address the crucial free space path loss problem experienced by signals from the tag at mmWave bands by building upon Van Atta Arrays that retro-reflect incident energy back towards the transmitting radar with minimal loss and low power consumption.

The main advantage of WiFi backscatter technologies over RFID is that data from their tags can be read using existing WiFi infrastructures instead of specialized readers. This can potentially reduce the complexity and cost of deploying battery-free sensors. Despite extensive work in this area, none of the existing systems are in widespread use today. We hypothesize that this is because WiFi-based backscatter tags do not scale well and their range and capabilities are limited when compared with RFID. To test this hypothesis we conduct several real-world experiments.We compare WiFi backscatter and RFID technologies in terms of RF harvesting capabilities, throughput, range and scalability. Our results show that existing WiFi backscatter tags cannot rely on RF harvesting (as opposed to RFID tags) due to their high power consumption. We find that WiFi backscatter tags must be quite close to a WiFi device to work robustly in non-line-of-sight scenarios, limiting their operating range. Furthermore, our results show that some WiFi backscatter systems can cause significant interference for existing WiFi traffic and be affected by them since they do not perform carrier sensing.},

	abstract     = {As Video Streaming and Analytics (VSA) systems become increasingly popular, serious privacy concerns have risen on exposing too much unnecessary private information to the VSA providers. Yet, it is challenging to protect privacy while still preserving desired VSA features, i.e., effective analytics, forensic support, resource efficiency, and real-time execution. In this paper, we present a VSA privacy enhancement system (PECAM), which addresses the above challenge with no change in the VSA back-end. PECAM leverages a novel Generative Adversarial Network to perform the privacy-enhanced securely-reversible video transformation. PECAM also incorporates a couple of system optimizations into its VSA workflow to reduce network bandwidth usage and enable real-time processing on cameras. We implement our PECAM prototype on commodity hardware and evaluate its performance via both security study and extensive experiments. Results demonstrate that PECAM can effectively enhance the visual privacy of VSA in the presence of an adversary, and its transformed videos, when taken as input for various VSA back-end tasks, maintain a 96% accuracy of corresponding original videos. Additionally, it performs 12.3\texttimes{} and 1.8\texttimes{} better than baseline methods in terms of the computing cost and network bandwidth usage, respectively.},

	abstract     = {Vehicle trajectories provide essential information to understand the urban mobility and benefit a wide range of urban applications. State-of-the-art solutions for vehicle sensing may not build accurate and complete knowledge of all vehicle trajectories. In order to fill the gap, this paper proposes VeTrac, a comprehensive system that employs widely deployed traffic cameras as a sensing network to trace vehicle movements and reconstruct their trajectories in a large scale. VeTrac fuses mobility correlation and vision-based analysis to reduce uncertainties in identifying vehicles. A graph convolution process is employed to maintain the identity consistency across different camera observations, and a self-training process is invoked when aligning with the urban road network to reconstruct vehicle trajectories with confidence. Extensive experiments with real-world data input of over 7 million vehicle snapshots from over one thousand traffic cameras demonstrate that VeTrac achieves 98% accuracy for simple expressway scenario and 89% accuracy for complex urban environment. The achieved accuracy outperforms alternative solutions by 32% for expressway scenario and by 59% for complex urban environment.},

	abstract     = {Wireless sensors have enabled a number of key applications. Due to their energy constraints, wireless sensors today communicate occasional short samples or pre-determined summary statistics of the data they collect. This means that computing every additional statistic at high fidelity incurs additional communication and energy overhead. This paper presents Joltik, a framework enabling general, future-proof, and energy-efficient analytics for low power wireless sensors. Joltik is general in that it summarizes sensed data from low-power devices without making assumptions on which specific statistical metric(s) are desired at the cloud and is future-proof, meaning it supports new, unforeseen metrics. Joltik is built upon recent theoretical advances in universal sketching, which can enable a Joltik sensor node to report a compact summary of observed data to enable a large class of statistical summaries. We address key system design and implementation challenges with respect to communication, memory, and computation bottlenecks that arise in practically realizing the potential benefits of universal sketching in the low-power regime. We present a proof-of-concept testbed evaluation of Joltik in LoRaWAN NUCLEO-L476RG boards and sensors. Across a range of realistic datasets, Joltik provides up to a 24.6\texttimes{} reduction in energy cost compared to transmitting raw data and outperforms many natural alternatives (e.g., sub-sampling, custom sketches, compressed sensing, and lossy compression) in terms of energy-accuracy trade-offs.},

Customers need to contact customer care to request assistance before these issues are resolved. This paper presents our experience with PACE (<u>P</u>ro<u>A</u>ctive customer <u>C</u>ar<u>E</u>), a novel, proactive system that monitors, troubleshoots and resolves individual service issues, without having to rely on customers to first contact customer care for assistance. PACE seeks to improve customer experience and care operation efficiency by automatically detecting individual (non-outage related) service issues, prioritizing repair actions by predicting customers who are likely to contact care to report their issues, and proactively triggering actions to resolve these issues. We develop three machine learning-based prediction models, and implement a fully automated system that integrates these prediction models and takes resolution actions for individual customers. We conduct a large-scale trace-driven evaluation using real-world data collected from a major cellular carrier in the US, and demonstrate that PACE is able to predict customers who are likely to contact care due to non-outage related individual service issues with high accuracy. We further deploy PACE into this cellular carrier network. Our field trial results show that PACE is effective in proactively resolving non-outage related individual customer service issues, improving customer experience, and reducing the need for customers to report their service issues.},

We introduce SociTrack, a platform for autonomous social interaction tracking via wireless distance measurements. Deployments require no supporting infrastructure and provide sub-second, decimeter-accurate ranging information over multiple days. The key insight that enables both deployability and fidelity in one system is to decouple node mobility and network management from range measurement, which results in a novel dual-radio architecture. SociTrack leverages an energy-efficient and scalable ranging protocol that is accurate to 14.8 cm (99th percentile) in complex indoor environments and allows our prototype to operate for 12 days on a 2000 mAh battery. Finally, to validate its deployability and efficacy, SociTrack is used by early childhood development researchers to capture caregiver-infant interactions.},

	abstract     = {Temperature sensor is one of the most widespread technologies in the IoT era. Wireless temperature monitoring systems are convenient to deploy and can drive mass applications in the fields of smart home, transportation and logistics. Currently, wireless temperature monitoring products are based on microelectronic and semiconductor components, which are not cost-effective (e.g., a few dollars) and more importantly, generate electronic wastes. In this work, we present ThermoWave, a new paradigm of wireless temperature monitoring that is ecological, battery-less, and ultra-low cost. Specifically, ThermoWave is on the basis of the thermal scattering effect on millimeter-wave (mmWave) signals. Specifically, cholesteryl materials align their molecular patterns at different environmental temperatures, and this temperature-induced pattern change will be modulated and sensed by the scattered mmWave signals. There are three functional modules in the ThermoWave system. The ThermoTag is a cholesteryl material inked film or paper tag that can be conveniently attached to the object of interest to monitor temperature changes. Each ThermoTag costs less than 0.01 dollars. The temperature modulated mmWave scattering will be received by a mmWave-radar based ThermoScanner and demodulated by a software-based temperature decoder ThermoSense, which includes a model-based method (i.e., ThermoDot) for point temperature estimation and a data-driven method (i.e., ThermoNet) for thermal imaging. We prototype and evaluate the ThermoWave system performance in both controlled and real-world setups. Experimental results show that the ThermoWave achieves the precision of Â±1.0Â°F in the range of 30Â°F to 120Â°F in a controlled setup. We also investigate the performance in real-world applications, and the ThermoWave can reach the Â±3.0Â°F precision in the temperature estimation. We also test and discuss sustainability, durability, robustness, and cost-effectiveness of the ThermoWave in both design and experiments.},

The Age of Information (AoI) is a performance metric that captures how fresh the information is from the perspective of the destination. In this paper, we show that as the congestion in the wireless network increases, the AoI degrades sharply, leading to outdated information at the destination. Leveraging years of theoretical research, we propose and implement WiFresh: an unconventional architecture that achieves near optimal information freshness in wireless networks, regardless of the level of congestion. Our experimental results show that WiFresh can improve information freshness by two orders of magnitude when compared to an equivalent standard WiFi network.},

From the pervasive WiFi signals, WiPose can reconstruct 3D skeletons composed of the joints on both limbs and torso of the human body. By overcoming the technical challenges faced by traditional camera-based human perception solutions, such as lighting and occlusion, the proposed WiFi human sensing technique demonstrates the potential to enable a new generation of applications such as health care, assisted living, gaming, and virtual reality. WiPose is based on a novel deep learning model that addresses a series of technical challenges. First, WiPose can encode the prior knowledge of human skeleton into the posture construction process to ensure the estimated joints satisfy the skeletal structure of the human body. Second, to achieve cross environment generalization, WiPose takes as input a 3D velocity profile which can capture the movements of the whole 3D space, and thus separate posture-specific features from the static objects in the ambient environment. Finally, WiPose employs a recurrent neural network (RNN) and a smooth loss to enforce smooth movements of the generated skeletons. Our evaluation results on a real-world WiFi sensing testbed with distributed antennas show that WiPose can localize each joint on the human skeleton with an average error of 2.83cm, achieving a 35% improvement in accuracy over the state-of-the-art posture construction model designed for dedicated radar sensors.},

Existing electric toothbrushing monitoring systems fail to detect these issues because they cannot achieve fine-grained position tracking. In this paper, we present a novel electric toothbrushing monitoring system called MET that tracks brushing coverage for all the 15 surfaces of teeth and detects different types of incorrect brushing techniques. This design is inspired by our observation that the motor inside an electric toothbrush generates a unique magnetic field, which can serve as a reliable signal for position and orientation tracking. MET is the first system that tracks both the position and orientation of an unmodified electric motor using magnetic inductive sensing. Experiments with fourteen users show that the average toothbrushing surface recognition accuracy of MET is 85.3%. Moreover, MET is robust to user location changes and posture variations and does not require any training from the users. Experimental results also demonstrate our significant advantages over existing commercial systems.},

	abstract     = {Voice assistants such as Amazon Echo (Alexa) and Google Home use microphone arrays to estimate the angle of arrival (AoA) of the human voice. This paper focuses on adding user localization as a new capability to voice assistants. For any voice command, we desire Alexa to be able to localize the user inside the home. The core challenge is two-fold: (1) accurately estimating the AoAs of multipath echoes without the knowledge of the source signal, and (2) tracing back these AoAs to reverse triangulate the user's location.We develop VoLoc, a system that proposes an iterative align-and-cancel algorithm for improved multipath AoA estimation, followed by an error-minimization technique to estimate the geometry of a nearby wall reflection. The AoAs and geometric parameters of the nearby wall are then fused to reveal the user's location. Under modest assumptions, we report localization accuracy of 0.44 m across different rooms, clutter, and user/microphone locations. VoLoc runs in near real-time but needs to hear around 15 voice commands before becoming operational.},

This paper introduces RetroI2V - a novel infrastructure-to-vehicle (I2V) communication and networking system that renovates conventional road signs to convey additional and dynamic information to vehicles while keeping intact their original functionality. In particular, RetroI2V exploits the retroreflective coating of road signs and establishes visible light backscattering communication (VLBC), and further coordinates multiple concurrent VLBC sessions among road signs and approaching vehicles. RetroI2V features a suite of novel VLBC designs including late-polarization, complementary optical signaling and polarization-based differential reception which are crucial to avoid flickering and achieve long VLBC range, as well as a decentralized MAC protocol that make practical multiple access in highly mobile and transient I2V settings. Experimental results from our prototyped system show that RetroI2V supports up to 101 m communication range and efficient multiple access at scale.},

Firstly, despite recent advances in Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based face identification, we observe that state-of-the-art models fail to accurately identify Low-Resolution (LR) faces. Accordingly, we design a novel Identity Clarification Network to recover missing details in the LR faces, which enhances true positives by 78% with only 14% false positives. Furthermore, designing EagleEye involves unique challenges compared to recent continuous mobile vision systems in that it requires running a series of complex DNNs multiple times on a high-resolution image. To tackle the challenge, we develop Content-Adaptive Parallel Execution to optimize complex multi-DNN face identification pipeline execution latency using heterogeneous processors on mobile and cloud. Our results show that EagleEye achieves 9.07X faster latency compared to naive execution, with only 108 KBytes of data offloaded.},

We exploit the small wavelength of mm-wave to achieve strong signal isolation between transmit and receive antennas. We further build a custom IC that achieves high-bandwidth analog cancellation at mm-wave frequencies. Finally, we present digital self-interference cancellation algorithms that address the unique hardware impairments observed at mm-wave frequencies. A detailed evaluation of mmFD demonstrates 84 dB of cancellation and 1.7X throughput gain over equivalent half-duplex systems in rich indoor settings.},

	abstract     = {Network analytics are widely used in many fields. Increasingly though, the networks of interest are high dimensional. Rather than just focusing on the traditional who is interaction with whom networks, modern network analysis examines the who, what, where, when and why ecology of relations. For example, studies of organizations might look at the social network within the organization as well as the task assignment and knowledge network. Studies using Twitter frequently look at the mentions network at the same time as the hashtag network. Making network science actionable typically involves answering questions about where the network is concentrated or how the network varies over time. This tutorial will cover the basics of Network analytics and demonstrate the use of ORA to support social media analytics using high dimensional network analytics and visualization for social media networks, semantic networks, geo-spatial networks, and dynamic networks. It will cover the basics of visualizing and analyzing time varying networks and spatially positioned networks.

Asthe control layer is vulnerable to DDoS attack, the goal of this paper is to provide a defense system which is based on Learning Automata (LA) concepts.

However, current Medium Access Control (MAC) layers filter incoming frames based on destination addresses, not content. The data-centric network community has resorted to MAC broadcast, with high and greatly varying frame loss rates. We propose V-MAC, a data-centric MAC layer that filters frames by content. It supports one to many multicast at MAC level, and ensures a uniform and controllable small frame loss rate across all receivers, despite their varying reception qualities. We have created a V-MAC prototype using Raspberry Pis and WiFi dongles. Experiments under extremely noisy environment show that it reduces frame loss from 50% (broadcast) to less than 10%, and consistently among multiple receivers.},

From the engineering side it is concerned with building the cyber-infrastructure needed for society to persist in its essential character in a cyber-mediated information environment under changing conditions, in the presence of actual or imminent social cyber-threats. Research in social cyber-security has demonstrated that social media and personalized data assistants are critical technologies that affect the ways humans navigate this cyber-mediated information space, and the way they interact and engage in discussions. This impact is complex and is related to the human socio-cognitive response, engineered features of the technologies, and the policy/legal environment in which humans and technology interact. The changing nature of interaction in the cyber-mediated information environment are creating new scientific and policy challenges that those in social cyber-security must address. This talk will describe the nature, promise of, and challenges in social cyber-security.

	abstract     = {Virtual assistants, such as Alexa, Google Home, and Siri, are revolutionizing our digital life. In the future, they will provide us with a uniform, fully personalized, natural-language interface to all our diverse data sources, web services and IoT devices. The virtual assistant will become a powerful platform as it sees all our personal data and has great influence over the services and vendors we use. We propose a collaborative research effort to develop open-source virtual assistant technology, in concert with a commercially viable distributed infrastructure that safeguards users' data privacy, supports interoperability, and promotes open competition. To jumpstart this effort, we have developed Almond, a working open-source prototype of distributed virtual assistants. Almond lets users use natural language to share their data, IoT, and services with fine-grain control, while preserving their privacy by keeping data on their own devices. Almond also lets users issue advanced commands that monitor real-time events and connect multiple services together. This research lays the groundwork for the creation of three key open, non-proprietary, collaborative virtual assistant resources: (1) Thingpedia, a repository of virtual assistant skills, (2) LUInet (Linguistic User Interface Network), a neural network that translates natural language into ThingTalk, a virtual assistant programming language, and (3) a Distributed ThingTalk Protocol, DTP, that supports sharing with privacy via cooperating virtual assistants.},

While this makes smartphones a seemingly ideal platform to serve as a gateway between sensors and the cloud, we find that a device designed for multi-tenant operation and frequent human interaction becomes unreliable when tasked to continuously run a single application with no human interaction, a seemingly counter-intuitive result. Further, we find that economy phones cannot physically withstand continuous operation, resulting in a surprisingly high rate of permanent device failures in the field. If these observations hold more broadly, they would make mobile phones poorly suited to a range of sensing applications for which they have been rumored to hold great promise.},

We then develop novel online algorithms that determine which spatial portions to fetch and their corresponding qualities. We also innovate other components in the streaming pipeline such as decoding and server-side transmission. Through extensive evaluations (~400 hours' playback on WiFi and ~100 hours over LTE), we show that Flare significantly improves the QoE in real-world settings. Compared to non-viewport-adaptive approaches, Flare yields up to 18x quality level improvement on WiFi, and achieves high bandwidth reduction (up to 35%) and video quality enhancement (up to 4.9x) on LTE.},

	abstract     = {Each fall, millions of monarch butterflies across the northern US and Canada migrate up to 4,000 km to overwinter in the exact same cluster of mountain peaks in central Mexico. To track monarchs precisely and study their navigation, a monarch tracker must obtain daily localization of the butterfly as it progresses on its 3-month journey. And, the tracker must perform this task while having a weight in the tens of milligram (mg) and measuring a few millimeters (mm) in size to avoid interfering with monarch's flight. This paper proposes mSAIL, 8 \texttimes{} 8 \texttimes{} 2.6 mm and 62 mg embedded system for monarch migration tracking, constructed using 8 prior custom-designed ICs providing solar energy harvesting, an ultra-low power processor, light/temperature sensors, power management, and a wireless transceiver, all integrated and 3D stacked on a micro PCB with an 8 \texttimes{} 8 mm printed antenna. The proposed system is designed to record and compress light and temperature data during the migration path while harvesting solar energy for energy autonomy, and wirelessly transmit the data at the overwintering site in Mexico, from which the daily location of the butterfly can be estimated using a deep learning-based localization algorithm. A 2-day trial experiment of mSAIL attached on a live butterfly in an outdoor botanical garden demonstrates the feasibility of individual butterfly localization and tracking.},

We address several challenges on the system design in the LiFi transmitter, the tag and the RF receiver. We design the first LiFi transmitter that implements a chirp spread spectrum (CSS) using the visible light spectrum. We use a small bank of solar cells for communication and harvesting and reconfigure them based on the amount of harvested energy and desired data rate. We further alleviate the low responsiveness of solar cells with a new low-power receiver design in the tag.

	abstract     = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) have become ubiquitous techniques in mobile and embedded systems for applications such as image/object recognition and classification. The trend of executing multiple DNNs simultaneously exacerbate the existing limitations of meeting stringent latency/accuracy requirements on resource constrained mobile devices. The prior art sheds light on exploring the accuracy-resource tradeoff by scaling the model sizes in accordance to resource dynamics. However, such model scaling approaches face to imminent challenges: (i) large space exploration of model sizes, and (ii) prohibitively long training time for different model combinations. In this paper, we present LegoDNN, a lightweight, block-grained scaling solution for running multi-DNN workloads in mobile vision systems. LegoDNN guarantees short model training times by only extracting and training a small number of common blocks (e.g. 5 in VGG and 8 in ResNet) in a DNN. At run-time, LegoDNN optimally combines the descendant models of these blocks to maximize accuracy under specific resources and latency constraints, while reducing switching overhead via smart block-level scaling of the DNN. We implement LegoDNN in TensorFlow Lite and extensively evaluate it against state-of-the-art techniques (FLOP scaling, knowledge distillation and model compression) using a set of 12 popular DNN models. Evaluation results show that LegoDNN provides 1,296x to 279,936x more options in model sizes without increasing training time, thus achieving as much as 31.74% improvement in inference accuracy and 71.07% reduction in scaling energy consumptions.},

For instance, a user of a video editing app would be able to use a smart pad as a canvas and a smartphone as a remote toolbox so that the toolbox does not occlude the canvas during editing. However, existing approaches do not properly support the single-app multi-device execution due to several limitations, including high development cost, device heterogeneity, and high performance requirement. In this paper, we introduce FLUID-XP, a novel cross-platform multi-device system that enables UIs of a single app to be executed across heterogeneous platforms, while overcoming the limitations of previous approaches. FLUID-XP provides flexible, efficient, and seamless interactions by addressing three main challenges: i) how to transparently enable a single-display app to use multiple displays, ii) how to distribute UIs across heterogeneous devices with minimal network traffic, and iii) how to optimize the UI distribution process when multiple UIs have different distribution requirements. Our experiments with a working prototype of FLUID-XP on Android confirm that FLUID-XP successfully supports a variety of unmodified real-world apps across heterogeneous platforms (Android, iOS, and Linux). We also conduct a lab study with 25 participants to demonstrate the effectiveness of FLUID-XP with real users.},

	abstract     = {Biometric-based authentication is gaining increasing attention for wearables and mobile applications. Meanwhile, the growing adoption of sensors in wearables also provides opportunities to capture novel wearable biometrics. In this work, we propose EarDynamic, an ear canal deformation based user authentication using ear wearables (earables). EarDynamic provides continuous and passive user authentication and is transparent to users. It leverages ear canal deformation that combines the unique static geometry and dynamic motions of the ear canal when the user is speaking for authentication. It utilizes an acoustic sensing approach to capture the ear canal deformation with the built-in microphone and speaker of the earables.

It then analyzes the reflected signals and extracts fine-grained acoustic features that correspond to the ear canal deformation for user authentication.

	abstract     = {We present GROOT, a mobile volumetric video streaming system that delivers three-dimensional data to mobile devices for a fully immersive virtual and augmented reality experience. The system design for streaming volumetric videos should be fundamentally different from conventional 2D video streaming systems. First, the amount of data required to deliver the 3D volume is considerably larger than conventional videos with frames of 2D images, even compared to high-resolution 2D or 360Â° videos. Second, the 3D data representation, which encodes the surface of objects within the volume, is a sparse and unorganized data structure with varying scales, whereas a conventional video is composed of a sequence of images with the fixed-size 2D grid structure. GROOT is a streaming framework with a novel data structure that enables not only real-time transmission and decoding on mobile devices but also continuous on-demand user view adaptation. Specifically, we modify the conventional octree to introduce the independence of leaf nodes with minimal memory overhead, which enables parallel decoding of highly irregular 3D data. We also developed a suite of techniques to compress color information and filter out 3D points outside of a user's view, which efficiently minimizes the data size and decoding cost. Our extensive evaluation shows that GROOT achieves more stable but faster frame rates compared to any previous method to stream and visualize volumetric videos on mobile devices.},

We intend to play 3D audio-annotations in the user's ears as she moves and looks at AAR objects in the environment. While companies like Bose and Microsoft are beginning to release such capabilities, they are intended for outdoor environments. Our system aims to explore the challenges indoors, without requiring any infrastructure deployment. Our core idea is two-fold. (1) We jointly use the inertial sensors (IMUs) in earphones and smartphones to estimate a user's indoor location and gazing orientation. (2) We play 3D sounds in the earphones and exploit the human's responses to (re)calibrate errors in location and orientation. We believe this fusion of IMU and acoustics is novel, and could be an important step towards indoor AAR. Our system, Ear-AR, is tested on 7 volunteers invited to an AAR exhibition - like a museum - that we set up in our building's lobby and lab. Across 60 different test sessions, the volunteers browsed different subsets of 24 annotated objects as they walked around. Results show that Ear-AR plays the correct audio-annotations with good accuracy. The user-feedback is encouraging and points to further areas of research and applications.},

	abstract     = {Retailers are aiming to enhance customer experience by automating the checkout process. The key impediment here is the effort to manually align the product barcode with the scanner, requiring sequential handling of items without blocking the line-of-sight of the laser beam. While recent systems such as Amazon Go eliminate human involvement using an extensive array of cameras, we propose a privacy-preserving alternative, RFGo, that identifies products using passive RFID tags. Foregoing continuous monitoring of customers throughout the store, RFGo scans the products in a dedicated checkout area that is large enough for customers to simply walk in and stand until the scan is complete (in two seconds). Achieving such low-latency checkout is not possible with traditional RFID readers, which decode tags using one antenna at a time. To overcome this, RFGo includes a custom-built RFID reader that simultaneously decodes a tag's response from multiple carrier-level synchronized antennas enabling a large set of tag observations in a very short time. RFGo then feeds these observations to a neural network that accurately distinguishes the products within the checkout area from those that are outside. We build a prototype of RFGo and evaluate its performance in challenging scenarios. Our experiments show that RFGo is extremely accurate, fast and well-suited for practical deployment in apparel stores.},

However, the feasibility of mmWave vehicle-to-everything (V2X) connectivity has long been questioned. One major doubt lies in how the highly directional mmWave links can sustain under high mobility. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive reality check of mmWave V2X networks. We deploy an experimental testbed to mimic a typical mmWave V2X scenario, and customize a COTS mmWave radio to enable microscopic investigation of the channel and the link. We further construct a high-fidelity 3D ray-tracer to reproduce the mmWave characteristics at scale. With this toolset, we study the mmWave V2X coverage, mobility and blockage, codebook/beam management, and spatial multiplexing. Our measurement debunks some common misperceptions of mmWave V2X networks. In particular, due to the constrained roadway network structures, we find the beam management can be handled easily by the often-denounced beam scanning schemes, as long as the codebook is properly designed. Blockage can be almost eliminated through proper basestation deployment and cooperation. Highly effective spatial multiplexing can be realized even without sophisticated MIMO radios. Our work points to possible ways to realize efficient and reliable mmWave networks under high mobility, while maintaining the simplicity of standard network protocols.},

QBP reduces the LDPC decoding to a discrete optimization problem, then embeds that reduced design onto quantum annealing hardware. QBP's embedding design can support LDPC codes of block length up to 420 bits on real state-of-the-art QA hardware with 2,048 qubits. We evaluate performance on real quantum annealer hardware, performing sensitivity analyses on a variety of parameter settings. Our design achieves a bit error rate of 10--8 in 20 Î¼s and a 1,500 byte frame error rate of 10--6 in 50 Î¼s at SNR 9 dB over a Gaussian noise wireless channel. Further experiments measure performance over real-world wireless channels, requiring 30 Î¼s to achieve a 1,500 byte 99.99% frame delivery rate at SNR 15-20 dB. QBP achieves a performance improvement over an FPGA based soft belief propagation LDPC decoder, by reaching a bit error rate of 10--8 and a frame error rate of 10--6 at an SNR 2.5--3.5 dB lower. In terms of limitations, QBP currently cannot realize practical protocol-sized (e.g., Wi-Fi, WiMax) LDPC codes on current QA processors.

	abstract     = {Backscatter enables transmissions at orders of magnitude lower energy consumption when compared to conventional radio transmitters. Backscatter tags achieve this by the reflection or absorption of carrier signal generated from emitter devices. However, backscatter systems are limited by these emitter devices, as they are significantly energy-expensive when compared to the tags. While backscatter tags can operate without requiring batteries, relying on the minuscule amounts of energy harvested from the ambient environment. However, the emitter devices, are commonly tethered to an external power supply or operate on large batteries.We present Tunnel Emitter: a tunnel diode oscillator based system that enables the generation of carrier signals at a peak biasing power of tens of Î¼W. Thus, for the first time, it allows battery-free emitter devices. The key enabler to the design is a phenomenon exhibited by tunnel diode oscillators that we call back injection, and we are the first to demonstrate. Back injection enables the emitter devices to amplify (up to 20 dB) and relay the backscattered signal. Our results show that Tunnel Emitter when operating together with a tag from long-range backscatter system, facilitates multi-floor communication. Tunnel Emitter, due to the back injection phenomenon, achieves this with a carrier signal that is orders of magnitude weaker than used in state-of-the-art systems. We believe Tunnel Emitter overcomes the key constraint restricting backscatter systems and thus can make backscatter systems ubiquitous.},

These vibrations are strong enough to propagate to the edge of the face and produce vibratory signals at an earphone. By re-tasking the earphone speaker as an input transducer - a software modification in the sound card - we are able to sense teeth-related gestures across various models of ear/headphones. In fact, by analyzing the signals at the two earphones, we show the feasibility of also localizing teeth gestures, resulting in a human-to-machine interface. Challenges range from coping with weak signals, distortions due to different teeth compositions, lack of timing resolution, spectral dispersion, etc. We address these problems with a sequence of sensing techniques, resulting in the ability to detect 6 distinct gestures in real-time. Results from 18 volunteers exhibit robustness, even though our system - EarSense - does not depend on per-user training. Importantly, EarSense also remains robust in the presence of concurrent user activities, like walking, nodding, cooking and cycling. Our ongoing work is focused on detecting teeth gestures even while music is being played in the earphone; once that problem is solved, we believe EarSense could be even more compelling.},

Future AR apps impose an explored challenging workload: i) concurrent execution of multiple Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for physical world and user behavior analysis, and ii) seamless rendering in presence of the DNN execution for immersive user experience. Existing mobile deep learning frameworks, however, fail to support such workload: multi-DNN GPU contention slows down inference latency (e.g., from 59.93 to 1181 ms), and rendering-DNN GPU contention degrades frame rate (e.g., from 30 to â12 fps). Multi-tasking for desktop GPUs (e.g., parallelization, preemption) cannot be applied to mobile GPUs as well due to limited architectural support and memory bandwidth. To tackle the challenge, we design a Pseudo-Preemption mechanism which i) breaks down the bulky DNN into smaller units, and ii) prioritizes and flexibly schedules concurrent GPU tasks. We prototyped Heimdall over various mobile GPUs (i.e., recent Adreno series) and multiple AR app scenarios that involve combinations of 8 state-of-the-art DNNs. Our extensive evaluation shows that Heimdall enhances the frame rate from â12 to â30 fps while reducing the worst-case DNN inference latency by up to â15 times compared to the baseline multi-threading approach.},

	abstract     = {With the explosive increase in wireless devices, physical-layer signal analysis has become critically beneficial across distinctive domains including interference minimization in network planning, security and privacy (e.g., drone and spycam detection), and mobile health with remote sensing. While SDR is known to be highly effective in realizing such services, they are rarely deployed or used by the end-users due to the costly hardware ~1K USD (e.g., USRP). Low-cost SDRs (e.g., RTL-SDR) are available, but their bandwidth is limited to 2-3 MHz and operation range falls well below 2.4 GHz - the unlicensed band holding majority of the wireless devices. This paper presents SDR-Lite, the first zero-cost, software-only software defined radio (SDR) receiver that empowers commodity WiFi to retrieve the In-phase and Quadrature of an ambient signal. With the full compatibility to pervasively-deployed WiFi infrastructure (without any change to the hardware and firmware), SDR-Lite aims to spread the blessing of SDR receiver functionalities to billions of WiFi users and households to enhance our everyday lives. The key idea of SDR-Lite is to trick WiFi to begin packet reception (i.e., the decoding process) when the packet is absent, so that it accepts ambient signals in the air and outputs corresponding bits. The bits are then reconstructed to the original physical-layer waveform, on which diverse SDR applications are performed. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that the reconstructed signal closely reassembles the original ambient signal (&gt;85% correlation). We extensively demonstrate SDR-Lite effectiveness across seven distinctive SDR receiver applications under three representative categories: (i) RF fingerprinting, (ii) spectrum monitoring, and (iii) (ZigBee) decoding. For instance, in security applications of drone and rogue WiFi AP detection, SDR-Lite achieves 99% and 97% accuracy, which is comparable to USRP.},

VLC is considered as a secure wireless communication scheme because VLC signals can be easily constrained within physical boundaries. In this paper, for the first time, we show that VLC is not as secure as people thought: VLC can be sniffed through walls! The key principle behind this is that in VLC transmissions, a VLC transmitter not only emits visible light signals but also leaks out 'side channel RF signals'. The leaked RF signals can be sniffed by a receiver to decode the VLC transmissions even the receiver is blocked (e.g., by walls) from the VLC transmitter. In this work, we establish a theoretical model to quantify the amplitude of the leaked RF signal and verify the model with comprehensive experiments. We design and implement a VLC sniffing system including receiver coil design, signal processing and frame decoding, spanning across hardware and software. Field studies show that with a cheap receiver design, our system can simultaneously sniff transmissions from multiple VLC transmitters 6.4 meters away with a 14 cm concrete wall in between, where the distance exceeds the communication range of most state-of-the-art VLC systems. By simply twining a wired earphone on the arm, we can sniff the VLC transmission 1.9 meters away.},

This work focuses on the last leg of such delivery: physically approaching a customer's landing zone. This has traditionally relied on a combination of GPS and computer-vision to locate and identify a landing zone. Instead of using computer vision, we propose to use ultra-wideband beacons (UWB) to assist in the landing process. The UAV's location relative to the landing zone is continuously measured based on the wireless propagation delay between the UAV and the landing zone's corners. We show that a single pair of wireless devices, one at the UAV and one at the landing zone, suffices to obtain the UAV's location. The landing zone's UWB device, connected to multiple antennas, receives multiple copies of the UAV's signals, that enables a sub-decimeter 3D-localization of the UAV. This helps the UAV's control logic governing the approach and landing process.},

Edge-SLAM offloads the compute-intensive modules of Visual-SLAM to the edge without losing accuracy. Our experiments show that Edge-SLAM architecture reduces the use of computation and memory resources on mobile devices and keeps it constant.

	abstract     = {Location services, fundamentally, rely on two components: a mapping system and a positioning system. The mapping system provides the physical map of the space, and the positioning system identifies the position within the map. Outdoor location services have thrived over the last couple of decades because of well-established platforms for both these components (e.g. Google Maps for mapping, and GPS for positioning). In contrast, indoor location services haven't caught up because of the lack of reliable mapping and positioning frameworks. Wi-Fi positioning lacks maps and is also prone to environmental errors. In this paper, we present DLoc, a Deep Learning based wireless localization algorithm that can overcome traditional limitations of RF-based localization approaches (like multipath, occlusions, etc.). We augment DLoc with an automated mapping platform, MapFind. MapFind constructs location-tagged maps of the environment and generates training data for DLoc. Together, they allow off-the-shelf Wi-Fi devices like smartphones to access a map of the environment and to estimate their position with respect to that map. During our evaluation, MapFind has collected location estimates of over 105 thousand points under 8 different scenarios with varying furniture positions and people motion across two different spaces covering 2000 sq. Ft. DLoc outperforms state-of-the-art methods in Wi-Fi-based localization by 80% (median &amp; 90th percentile) across the two different spaces.},

It has been deployed worldwide to support two call services: VoLTE (Voice over LTE) and VoWi-Fi (Voice over Wi-Fi). VoWi-Fi enables telephony calls over the Wi-Fi network to complement VoLTE. In this work, we uncover that the VoWi-Fi signaling session can be hijacked to maliciously manipulate the IMS call operation. An adversary can easily make ghost calls to launch a stealthy call DoS (Denial of Service) attack against specific cellular users. Only phone numbers, but not any malware or network information, are required from the victims. This sophisticated attack harnesses a design defect of the IMS call state machine, but not simply flooding or a crash trigger. To stealthily detect attackable phones at run time, we exploit a vulnerability of the 4G network infrastructure, call information leakage, which we explore using machine learning. We validate these vulnerabilities in operational 4G networks of 4 top-tier carriers across Asia and North America countries with 7 phone brands. Our result shows that the call DoS attack can prevent the victims from receiving incoming calls up to 99.0% time without user awareness. We finally propose and evaluate recommended solutions.},

However, most of the existing PIR-based localization systems only utilize the binary information of PIR sensors and therefore require a large number of carefully deployed PIR sensors. A few works directly map the raw data of PIR sensors to one's location using machine learning approaches. However, these data-driven approaches require abundant training data and suffer from environmental change. In this paper, we propose PIRATES, a PIR-based device-free localization system based on the raw data of PIR sensors. The key of PIRATES is to extract a new type of location information called azimuth change. The extraction of the azimuth change relies on the physical properties of PIR sensors. Therefore, no abundant training data are needed and the system is robust to environmental change. Through experiments, we demonstrate that PIRATES can achieve higher localization accuracy than the state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, the information of the azimuth change can be easily incorporated with other information of PIR signals (e.g. amplitude) to improve the localization accuracy.},

The tutorial begins by discussing the potential cost and performance advantages of creating ICs with OCAs. The design of ICs in which the antenna and conventional circuitry are all fabricated on the same substrate offers advantages in terms of size, weight and cost over conventional RFID/sensor systems in which an IC is assembled onto an antenna substrate; however, it is challenging because the limited size of the antenna set by the die size and its proximity to a resistive ground plane (the IC substrate) both decrease the RF energy that can be harvested to operate the on-chip circuitry. In this Tutorial, we will apply simplifying approximations in order to develop basic equations relating the size and geometry of the antennas to the ability of the OCA-IC to harvest ambient RF energy; and, we will validate those equations with electromagnetic field simulations. The tutorial will also examine the challenging issue of matching the antenna to the on-chip electronics in a way that maximizes the power that can be extracted from an external RF signal. The Tutorial will consider operation across a range of frequencies and will explore both in-plane spiral antennas and out-of-plane helical antennas. The Tutorial will conclude with an analysis of the case when an OCA-ICs is integrated into medicines in order to provide secure validation of medicinal pills and capsules.},

Additionally, we explore the characteristic fiducial features from PPG measurements to efficiently distinguish the human cardiac system. Furthermore, we develop a cardiac-based classifier for user identification using the Gradient Boosting Tree (GBT).

Yet today's UAVs rely critically on inertial sensors and GPS to remain stable in-flight, meaning they struggle to penetrate urban canyons where GPS is unavailable. This poster presents LoRaTilt, a system that maintains stability of a UAV using a Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LP-WAN) transmitter. We mount a light-weight and ten-year battery-powered LP-WAN transmitter on a UAV and process its signals from base stations up to hundreds of meter away. We demonstrate how our system estimates and corrects for UAV drift in GPS-denied settings with minimal impact on the cost and flight life of a UAV. Our proof-of-concept experiments show a promising median accuracy of 1.2326 mm and 0.0164 radians in estimating the displacement and orientation of a drone with a LoRa LP-WAN radio.},

In this paper, we propose Proximity-Proof, a secure and usable mobile 2FA system without involving user interactions. Proximity-Proof automatically transmits a user's 2FA response via inaudible OFDM-modulated acoustic signals to the login browser. We propose a novel technique to extract individual speaker and microphone fingerprints of a mobile device to defend against the powerful man-in-the-middle (MiM) attack. In addition, Proximity-Proof explores two-way acoustic ranging to thwart the co-located attack. To the best of our knowledge, Proximity-Proof is the first mobile 2FA scheme resilient to the MiM and co-located attacks. We empirically analyze that Proximity-Proof is at least as secure as existing mobile 2FA solutions while being highly usable. We also prototype Proximity-Proof and confirm its high security, usability, and efficiency through comprehensive user experiments.},

This seemingly simple attack technique has been used in the growing telephony frauds and scam calls, resulting in substantial monetary loss and victim complaints. Unfortunately, caller ID spoofing is easy to launch, yet hard to defend; no effective and practical defense solutions are in place to date. In this paper, we propose CEIVE (Callee-only inference and verification), an effective and practical defense against caller ID spoofing. It is a victim callee only solution without requiring additional infrastructure support or changes on telephony systems. We formulate the design as an inference and verification problem. Given an incoming call, CEIVE leverages a callback session and its associated call signaling observed at the phone to infer the call state of the other party. It further compares with the anticipated call state, thus quickly verifying whether the incoming call comes from the originating number. We exploit the standardized call signaling messages to extract useful features, and devise call-specific verification and learning to handle diversity and extensibility. We implement CEIVE on Android phones and test it with all top four US mobile carriers, one landline and two small carriers. It shows 100% accuracy in almost all tested spoofing scenarios except one special, targeted attack case.},

To support its diverse operating conditions, a set of different OFDM numerologies has been defined in the standards body. Under this numerology, it is necessary to perform scheduling with a time resolution of â¼100 Î¼s. This requirement poses a new challenge that does not exist in LTE and cannot be supported by any existing LTE schedulers. In this paper, we present the design of GPF -- a GPU-based proportional fair (PF) scheduler that can meet the â¼100 Î¼s time requirement. The key ideas include decomposing the scheduling problem into a large number of small and independent sub-problems and selecting a subset of sub-problems from the most promising search space to fit into a GPU. By implementing GPF on an off-the-shelf Nvidia Quadro P6000 GPU, we show that GPF is able to achieve near-optimal performance while meeting the â¼100 $mathrmÎ¼s time requirement. GPF represents the first successful design of a GPU-based PF scheduler that can meet the new time requirement in NR.},

The program this year also includes an experience-track paper and a verification-track paper, reflecting contributions that present experiences in the deployment and operations of mobile systems and networks as well as contributions that seek to verify and/or characterize recent results using rigorous experimental methodology.This year's call for papers attracted 187 qualified submissions from across the globe that were carefully reviewed by 63 Program Committee (PC) members along with a selected group of 12 External Review Committee (ERC) experts. The PC was formed with the goal of covering diverse research expertise as well as diverse perspectives and approaches, and included researchers from 12 countries including China, France, Germany, Great Britain, India, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, and the United States. 18% of the PC members were female and there was broad industry participation with PC and ERC members from Alcatel-Lucent, Google, IBM, Microsoft, NEC, and Telefonica. The PC this year was "all-heavy," meaning that all members participated throughout the entire review and shepherding process.The paper review process was double-blind (both authors' and reviewers' identities were hidden from each other), and carried out in five phases: three review rounds, followed by an online discussion phase, and discussion at the PC meeting itself. In Round 1, each paper was reviewed by at least four PC members, with the top 122 papers selected for promotion to Round 2. In Round 2, each paper was reviewed by three more reviewers, with the top 92 papers selected for promotion to Round 3. Round 3 papers received between one and four further reviews, at the chairs' discretion, depending on the strength of their review scores as well as the confidence of those review scores. We are pleased to report evidence that the additional number of reviews helped the reliability of the review process: 15 papers had three Round 1 reviews all scoring either 1 or 2 (out of 4), yet eventually made it into Round 3 on the basis of a fourth first-round review score of 3 or above, and further high second-round scores.After Round 3, reviewers participated in an online discussion phase to come to an agreement on whether to promote each paper to discussion at the in-person PC meeting, based on an often-extensive technical exchange of each paper's merits and demerits. The online discussion phase resulted in 69 papers being promoted to discussion at the PC meeting, which was held on May 21-22 at Rutgers University in New Jersey. These 69 papers were organized by topic area, and discussed at length in the meeting. After the in-person PC meeting, 42 papers were selected to enter a new doublyanonymous shepherding process, which we describe next.}

Mobile edge clouds (MECs) allow the users to access the cloud services seamlessly. Although cloudlets provide a promising technique to reduce the service access latency, how to place the data-intensive service in MECs to reduce the communication overhead between different services is yet to be addressed. To attack this challenge, this paper proposes an approach for mining interacting services and placing the services on the cloudlets by optimizing the communication overhead. In this approach, a frequent itemsets mining algorithm is proposed to obtain the fine-grained frequent 2-itemsets by analyzing the cookies. This algorithm determines the minimum support threshold automatically, based on which FP-tree with FP-matrix is constructed to avoid traversing the FP-tree during the process of frequent 2-itemsets discovery, then a searching algorithm is presented to mine the discriminative frequent 2-itemsets with interestingness measure. Furthermore, the communication overhead is optimized with the capacity constraints of cloudlets. Finally, we validate the efficacy of our approach by real-world data based simulations. The results show our approach can reduce the communication overhead for service placement in MECs.},

Phase is a crucial physical feature for many RFID sensing applications, such as tag localization. Most existing methods rely on a low multipath environment for accurate phase measurement. Unfortunately, practical environments are highly likely to be multipath-revalent, especially for indoors. This paper presents the first work to extract "clean" phase measurement of RFID tags in multipath-prevalent environments. We propose CPEX (Clean Phase EXtraction) based on theoretical modeling, which is also validated via experimental results of our prototype implementation. We studied the performance of CPEX on tag localization. CPEX can achieve median errors of 4.3-6.4cm (in different setups), which is the most accurate 3D tag localization result in multipath-prevalent environments.},

While such systems initially used reflected light as the communication media, direct light becomes the dominant media for the purpose of combating interference. Nonetheless, the data rate achievable by direct light LED-Camera VLC systems has hit its bottleneck: the dimension of the transmitters. In this demo, we revisit the reflected light approach and propose a novel modulation mechanism, ReflexCode, which converts the potentially destructive interferences into collaborative transmissions. Essentially, our ReflexCode system codes information by superposing light emissions from multiple transmitters. It combines traditional amplitude demodulation with slope detection to "decode" the grayscale modulated signal, and it tunes decoding thresholds dynamically depending on the spatial symbol distribution. In addition, ReflexCode re-engineers the balanced codes to avoid flicker from individual transmitters. We implement ReflexCode as a prototype and demonstrate that it can achieve a promising throughput.},

A developer puts a non-trivial amount of effort to write these companion apps and the programming model does not scale to an increasing diversity of form factors. In this demo, we show a working prototype of our system UIWear that allows a developer to easily extend a smartphone application to other wearable interfaces. Our system, UIWear, extracts the application GUI as a UI tree, which preserves the semantics of the GUI. The developer (or the user) only writes a {em metaprogram} to encode the GUI design for the wearable device; no effort is needed beyond the design phase. UIWear executes the metaprogram by performing all the underlying tasks to virtualize the application GUI, adapt it, and recreate it on the wearable. A metaprogram can create the same functionality as existing companion apps with an order-of-magnitude less programming effort.},

To truly enable VR everywhere, we need position tracking to be available as a ubiquitous service. This paper demonstrates WiCapture, a novel approach which leverages commodity WiFi infrastructure, which is ubiquitous today, for tracking purposes. We prototyped WiCapture using off-the-shelf WiFi radios and demonstrated that it achieves an accuracy of 0.88 cm compared to sophisticated infrared-based tracking systems like the Oculus Rift, while providing much higher range, resistance to occlusion, ubiquity and ease of deployment.},

The two-tiered PC balanced the goals of broader inclusivity and running an effective TPC meeting. The TPC was made up of experts from diverse research areas, and TPC selection also took into account gender, seniority, institution, country, expertise, and academic or industrial background. The TPC included researchers from 10 countries: France, India, Italy, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, U.K., and the U.S. Twenty percent of the TPC members were female. The TPC also had broad industry participation, with members from Cisco, Google, IBM, Microsoft, and NEC.The paper review process was double-blind. It was carried out in three phases: First, each paper was reviewed by at least three TPC members, and the top 107 papers were advanced to the second phase. Review scores, in addition to reviewer confidence and normalization with respect to other papers by the same reviewer, were considered in the selection process. In the second phase, each paper was reviewed by at least two more reviewers, followed by an online discussion; that produced 68 papers for the TPC meeting on June 1 and 2 in Seattle, which was the final phase. These 68 papers were discussed at length at the meeting. Eventually, 35 papers were conditionally accepted into the program. The heavy PC participated in all three phases; the light TPC participated only in the first phase.Each of the 35 papers was assigned a shepherd from the heavy PC. Shepherds' identities were provided to authors, unlike in the previous year. Reviewers remained anonymous. Shepherds coordinated with reviewers to address the review comments and they approved the final versions for publication. The result of this process is a strong and diverse technical program consisting of 35 high-quality papers.}

Adaptive Millimetro makes use of automotive radars and enables communication with and accurate localization of roadside infrastructure overextended distances (i.e. &gt;100m). Millimetro achieves this by designing ultra-low-power retro-reflective tags that operate in the mmWave frequency band and can be embedded in road signs, pavements, bi-cycles, or even the clothing of pedestrians. Millimetro addresses the severe path loss problem of mmWave signals by combining coding gain and retro-reflective antenna front-end to achieve long-range operation. However, highly mobile scenarios may still experience unreliable performance due to the Doppler effect changing the received signals. In this paper, we demonstrate a simple solution for robust localization in high mobility by implementing a Moving Target Indication (MTI) filter and an adaptive Kalman filter. We also present an augmented reality app, as an in-car AR platform, that uses Adaptive Millimetroâs algorithms to estimate the tag positions and overlay a virtual box at the estimated locations.},

Given that people easily forget about their active camera during web conferences, the system advertises the camera's active status via its motions to remind users that they are being watched by others. This prevents inadvertent privacy leakage. The system is developed based on a motorized camera, which moves according to the user's head coordinates just like an eye is looking at the user's face in front of the desk rather than remotely or virtually. The basic idea is to exploit the original human body sense of environmental motions for human-camera interaction, which does not require looking straight at the camera or its LED light to actively check its status. In this demonstration, we showcase our implementation of the human perception-enhanced camera system and invite participants to use the system for web conferences (e.g., Zoom and Google Hangout), which illustrates the system's ability to extend the virtual social interaction to the physical world and the effectiveness of using the camera motion as a non-intrusive awareness indicator.},

In recent years, pervasive RF signals are further exploited for sensing; RF sensing has since attracted attentions from both academia and industry. Existing developments mainly employ commodity Wi-Fi hardware or rely on sophisticated SDR platforms. While promising in many aspects, there still remains a gap between lab prototypes and real-life deployments. On one hand, due to its narrow bandwidth and communication-oriented design, Wi-Fi sensing offers a coarse sensing granularity and its performance is very unstable in harsh real-world environments. On the other hand, SDR-based designs may hardly be adopted in practice due to its large size and high cost. To this end, we propose, design, and implement Octopus, a compact and flexible wideband MIMO sensing platform, built using commercial-grade low-power impulse radio. Octopus provides a standalone and fully programmable RF sensing solution; it allows for quick algorithm design and application development, and it specifically leverages the wideband radio to achieve a competent and robust performance in practice. We evaluate the performance of Octopus via micro-benchmarking, and further demonstrate its applicability using representative RF sensing applications, including passive localization, vibration sensing, and human/object imaging.},

Nervion embeds innovations to enable scalability via abstractions and RAN element containerization, and additionally supports an even more scalable control-plane only mode. It also offers ample flexibility in terms of realizing arbitrary RAN emulation scenarios, mapping them to compute clusters, and evaluating diverse core system designs.

	abstract     = {5G networks are gaining pace in development and deployment in recent years. One of 5G's key objective is to support a variety of use cases with different Service Level Objectives (SLOs). Slicing is a key part of 5G that allows operators to provide a tailored set of resources to different use cases in order to meet their SLOs. Existing works focus on slicing in the frontend or the C-RAN. However, slicing is missing in the fronthaul network that connects the frontend to the C-RAN. This leads to over-provisioning in the fronthaul and the C-RAN, and also limits the scalability of the network.In this paper, we design and implement Fronthaul Slicing Architecture (FSA), which to the best of our knowledge, is the first slicing architecture for the fronthaul network. FSA runs in the switch dataplane and uses information from the wireless schedule to identify the slice of a fronthaul data packet at line-rate. It enables multipoint-to-multipoint routing as well as packet prioritization to provide multiplexing gains in the fronthaul and the C-RAN, making the system more scalable. Our testbed evaluation using scaled-up LTE traces shows that FSA can support accurate multipoint-to-multipoint routing for 80 Gbps of fronthaul traffic. Further, the slice-aware packet scheduling enabled by FSA's packet prioritization reduces the 95th percentile Flowlet Completion Times (FCT) of latency-sensitive traffic by up to 4 times.},

	abstract     = {Headphones continue to become more intelligent as new functions (e.g., touch-based gesture control) appear. These functions usually rely on auxiliary sensors (e.g., accelerometer and gyroscope) that are available in smart headphones. However, for those headphones that do not have such sensors, supporting these functions becomes a daunting task. This paper presents HeadFi, a new design paradigm for bringing intelligence to headphones. Instead of adding auxiliary sensors into headphones, HeadFi turns the pair of drivers that are readily available inside all headphones into a versatile sensor to enable new applications spanning across mobile health, user-interface, and context-awareness. HeadFi works as a plug-in peripheral connecting the headphones and the pairing device (e.g., a smartphone). The simplicity (can be as simple as only two resistors) and small form factor of this design lend itself to be embedded into the pairing device as an integrated circuit. We envision HeadFi can serve as a vital supplementary solution to existing smart headphone design by directly transforming large amounts of existing "dumb" headphones into intelligent ones. We prototype HeadFi on PCB and conduct extensive experiments with 53 volunteers using 54 pairs of non-smart headphones under the institutional review board (IRB) protocols. The results show that HeadFi can achieve 97.2%--99.5% accuracy on user identification, 96.8%--99.2% accuracy on heart rate monitoring, and 97.7%--99.3% accuracy on gesture recognition.},

	abstract     = {We present the first system that can airdrop wireless sensors from small drones and live insects. In addition to the challenges of achieving low-power consumption and long-range communication, airdropping wireless sensors is difficult because it requires the sensor to survive the impact when dropped in mid-air. Our design takes inspiration from nature: small insects like ants can fall from tall buildings and survive because of their tiny mass and size. Inspired by this, we design insect-scale wireless sensors that come fully integrated with an onboard power supply and a lightweight mechanical actuator to detach from the aerial platform. Our system introduces a first-of-its-kind 37 mg mechanical release mechanism to drop the sensor during flight, using only 450 Î¼J of energy as well as a wireless communication link that can transmit sensor data at 33 kbps up to 1 km. Once deployed, our 98 mg wireless sensor can run for 1.3-2.5 years when transmitting 10-50 packets per hour on a 68 mg battery. We demonstrate attachment to a small 28 mm wide drone and a moth (Manduca sexta) and show that our insect-scale sensors flutter as they fall, suffering no damage on impact onto a tile floor from heights of 22 m.},

	abstract     = {Recent years have seen dramatic advances in low-power neural accelerators that aim to bring deep learning analytics to IoT devices; simultaneously, there have been considerable advances in the design of low-power radios to enable efficient compute offload from IoT devices to the cloud. Neither is a panacea --- deep learning models are often too large for low-power accelerators and bandwidth needs are often too high for low-power radios. While there has been considerable work on deep learning for smartphone-class devices, these methods do not work well for small battery-powered IoT devices that are considerably more resource-constrained.In this paper, we bridge this gap by designing a continuously tunable method for leveraging both local and remote resources to optimize performance of a deep learning model. Clio presents a novel approach to split machine learning models between an IoT device and cloud in a progressive manner that adapts to wireless dynamics. We show that this method can be combined with model compression and adaptive model partitioning to create an integrated system for IoT-cloud partitioning. We implement Clio on the GAP8 low-power neural accelerator, provide an exhaustive characterization of the operating regimes where each method performs best and show that Clio can enable graceful performance degradation as resources diminish.},

Efficient disease evaluation and monitoring call for daily spirometry tests, as an effective way of pulmonary function testing, out of clinic. This requirement, however, is hard to be satisfied due to the large size and high costs of current spirometry equipments. In this paper, we present SpiroSonic, a new system design that uses commodity smartphones to support complete, accurate yet reliable spirometry tests in regular home settings with various environmental and human factors. SpiroSonic measures the humans' chest wall motion via acoustic sensing and interprets such motion into lung function indices, based on the clinically validated correlation between them. We implemented SpiroSonic as a smartphone app, and verified SpiroSonic's monitoring error over healthy humans as &lt;3%. Clinical studies further show that SpiroSonic reaches 5%-10% monitoring error among 83 pediatric patients. Given that the error of in-clinic spirometry is usually around 5%, SpiroSonic can be reliably used for disease tracking and evaluation out of clinic.},

Our study reveals two key new characteristics that have been overlooked by past work. Specifically, the molecular communication channel exhibits non-causal inter-symbol-interference and a long delay spread, that extends beyond the channel coherence time, which limit decoding performance. To address this, we design, Î¼-Link a molecular communication protocol and decoder that accounts for these new insights.

	abstract     = {The demand for mobile video streaming has experienced tremendous growth over the last decade. However, existing methods of video delivery fall short of delivering high-quality video. Recent advances in neural super-resolution have opened up the possibility of enhancing video quality by leveraging client-side computation. Unfortunately, mobile devices cannot benefit from this because it is too expensive in computation and power-hungry.To overcome the limitation, we present NEMO, a system that enables real-time video super-resolution on mobile devices. NEMO applies neural super-resolution to a few select frames and transfers the outputs to benefit the remaining frames. The frames to which super-resolution is applied are carefully chosen to maximize the overall quality gains. NEMO leverages fine-grained dependencies using information from the video codec and strives to provide guarantees in the quality degradation compared to per-frame super-resolution. Our evaluation using a full system implementation on Android shows NEMO improves the overall processing throughput by x11.5, reduces energy consumption by 88.6%, and maintains device temperatures at acceptable levels compared to per-frame super-resolution, while ensuring high video quality. Overall, this leads to a 31.2% improvement in quality of experience for mobile users.},

Indoor environments may contain metal equipment that temporarily disrupts radio reception. During these momentary interruptions, a small UAV needs to be able to broadcast a 'heartbeat' to indicate that it is not damaged or lost. Considering alternative messaging modalities, we observe that light-based methods require line-of sight, which is not guaranteed when UAVs are moving through a cluttered environment, while a naive sound-based method is easily drowned out by the UAV's own loud motor and propeller noise.We present Bleep, a side-channel messaging system that modulates UAV motors sounds to enable multiple UAVs to communicate when radio is unavailable. Bleep accomplishes this by 1) embedding linear chirps within the PWM frequency while maintaining the controllability of the UAV and 2) decoding the received sounds utilizing chirp multiplication to enhance signal detection in loud motor noise. Our chirp-based encoding allows multiple simultaneous transmissions to be detected and decoded in the presence of loud sounds from multiple UAV motors. Through real-world experiments, we show that Bleep is able to achieve over 95% signal detection and decoding accuracy with simultaneous transmissions.},

PWM frequencies are adjusted to different values by screen manufacturers, therefore can successfully differentiate screens.

Scaling of network slices is required to cope with the resources needed for peak traffic demand. In this paper, we demonstrate scaling of network slices based on the type of network slice such as enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), massive Machine Type Communication (mMTC) in order to ensure Service Level Agreement (SLA) guarantees of the network slices with the help of our proposed Network Slicing Profiler (NSP) and Network Slice Scaling Function (NSSF) in an ETSI MANO based network slicing framework.},

Most of the current IoT system are specific and non-programmable and therefore their slices are difficult to reuse. It is difficult to meet different QoS requirements especially in IoT system because there are plenty of IoT sensors in IoT system. In this paper, we propose a novel IoT network slicing creation system which based on two emerging SDN and NFV technologies. It provides an easily-operating service creation environment and a service execution environment based on micro service architecture. We implement an IoT muti-flow transmission scenario. After adding subservices and QoS policies into a business process at the design plane, the IoT scenario can run automatically at the execution plane. Experiment results on the scenario show that the numbers of packets per second of different flows are changing gradually depend on QoS policies.},

	abstract     = {Handheld devices are becoming increasingly common in today's world. With every passing year, the diversity of applications (apps) being supported by mobile platforms is growing manyfold. In addition, Android, the most popular handheld OS in the market is releasing a new version every year, with a newer and richer set of APIs, enabling the next generation of feature-rich applications. To support these apps, hardware requirements of these devices are increasing rapidly. Mobile SoCs need a larger number of faster cores, better GPUs and above all, higher DRAM capacities to do justice to user experience. To augment capacity requirements, non-volatile memories (NVMs) have been proposed as a potential addition to LPDDR variants, which have been the mainstay of mobile SoCs. However, few tools exist to carry out architectural design space exploration of main memory hierarchies featuring NVMs for newer Android and app versions. In this paper, we present META, a trace based tool for facilitating the exploration of memory hierarchies in mobile devices. META uses an enhanced version of Android emulator for generating raw instruction traces. These traces are then fed into a cache hierarchy and memory simulation modules to carry out design space exploration for a wide variety of apps and memory technologies.},

The sensors measure heterogeneous time-varying signals and report their measurements to the central monitoring station which uses them to make control decisions. Due to limited communication capacity, not all sensors can send updates to the monitoring station at all times. The cost of the system pays at any time is a weighted sum of the ages-of-information of the various sensors at that time. The goal is to design scheduling policies which minimize the time-average of this cost. We propose a policy called SQRT-Weight which schedules updates from sensors at a frequency proportional to the square-root of the corresponding weights and show that this policy is asymptotically 8--optimal. In addition, we compare the performance of the SQRT-Weight policy with other natural scheduling policies via simulations.},

As the modern world receives &amp; sends millions of Terabytes of data every day, the present-day wireless data communication technologies comprising of Wi-Fi &amp; 4G-LTE is on the verge of becoming partially inept for information exchange as they suffer from spectrum congestion in both controlled and uncontrolled environments. Li-Fi, also known as light fidelity, is a full duplex communication network enabling transmittal of data. The potency of bidirectional Visible Light Communication allows us to build an ideal medium, independent of congested radio frequencies and interference from electromagnetic waves, thus, resulting in faster data transfer. Inception of LED technology for lighting in 90's paved the way for high growth trajectory for LED Lighting industry which we have witnessed from the last 2 decades. As semiconductors, LEDs were poised to develop much bigger applications like integrated sensors apart from normal dimming and ambient lighting. Li-Fi is a technology which creates a bridge between the world of data communication &amp; LED Lighting. Multiple forward &amp; backward integration are poised to happen in coming years when lighting players will develop enterprise communication enabled lighting products. Even system integrators will look forward to Li-Fi enabled luminaires for establishing wireless networks. Li-Fi is being seen as a big step forward in enabling 5G telecommunication networks. Security benefits and outdoor long-range communication capabilities Li-Fi a potential technology for Defence &amp; Smart Cities applications. Li-Fi uses the visible and invisible frequency band (380nm - 1500nm) which is 10,000 times broader than usable RF frequency band. The property of light spectrum to be unlicensed and free from any health regulations makes it even more desirable for us. Its applications can extend in areas where the RF technology lacks its presence like aircrafts and hospitals (operation theatres), power plants and various other areas, where electromagnetic (Radio) interference is of great concern for safety and security of equipment's and people. Since there is no potential health hazard associated with light, it can be used safely in such locations or areas. Li-Fi / OWC has applications in both indoor (â) and outdoor ( ) scenarios.},

In an underlay D2D communication, both cellular and D2D users coexist by simultaneously sharing the licensed cellular spectrum. However, the performance of an underlay D2D communication is limited by the amount of interference from the cellular user(CU) to the D2D user and vice versa. In this paper, we design and develop a test-bed to evaluate the real-world performance of the underlay D2D communication framework. We demonstrate the impact of interference caused by CU on D2D receiver's throughput at different cellular angles and position with respect to the base station (BS).

	abstract     = {Smart speakers allow users to interact with home appliances using voice commands and are becoming increasingly popular. While voice-based interface is intuitive, it is insufficient in many scenarios, such as in noisy or quiet environments, for users with language barriers, or in applications that require continuous motion tracking. Motion-based control is attractive and complementary to existing voice-based control. However, accurate and reliable room-scale motion tracking poses a significant challenge due to low SNR, interference, and varying mobility. To this end, we develop a novel recurrent neural network (RNN) based system that uses speakers and microphones to realize accurate room-scale tracking. Our system jointly estimates the propagation distance and angle-of-arrival (AoA) of signals reflected by the hand, based on AoA-distance profiles generated by 2D MUSIC. We design a series of techniques to significantly enhance the profile quality under low SNR. We feed the profiles in a recent history to our RNN to estimate the distance and AoA. In this way, we can exploit the temporal structure among consecutive profiles to remove the impact of noise, interference and mobility. Using extensive evaluation, we show our system achieves 1.2--3.7~cm error within 4.5~m range, supports tracking multiple users, and is robust against ambient sound. To our knowledge, this is the first acoustic device-free room-scale tracking system.},

	abstract     = {Future WLAN devices will combine both IEEE 802.11ad and 802.11ac interfaces. The former provides multi-Gbps rates but is susceptible to blockage, whereas the latter is slower but offers reliable connectivity. A fundamental challenge is thus how to combine those complementary technologies, to make the most of the advantages they offer. In this work, we explore leveraging Multipath TCP (MPTCP) to use both interfaces simultaneously in order to achieve a higher overall throughput as well as seamlessly switching to a single interface when the other one fails. We find that standard MPTCP often performs sub-optimally and may even yield a throughput much lower than that of single path TCP over the faster of the two interfaces. We analyze the cause of these performance issues in detail and then design MuSher, an agile MPTCP scheduler that allows MPTCP to fully utilize the channel resources available to both interfaces. Our evaluation in realistic scenarios shows that MuSher provides a throughput improvement of up to 1.5x/2.3x and speeds up the recovery of a traffic stream, after disruption, by a factor of up to 8x/75x, under WLAN/Internet settings respectively, compared to the default MPTCP scheduler.},

In this paper, we mainly focus on the SFC placement problem in a MEC-NFV environment, which is different from the data center network. Firstly, we formulate this problem as a weighted graph matching problem consisting of graph matching and SFC mapping. Then, we propose a linear programming-based approach to match the edge network and SFC. Finally, we design a Hungarian-based placement algorithm to map SFC in the edge network. A heuristic-based greedy algorithm is also designed to compare the performance. Evaluation results show that our proposed solutions outperform the greedy algorithm in terms of execution time.},

In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a system, called Strobe, that senses soil moisture and soil EC using RF propagation in existing Wi-Fi bands. Strobe overcomes the key challenge of limited bandwidth availability in the 2.4 GHz unlicensed spectrum using a novel multi-antenna technique. It maps the propagation time and amplitude of Wi-Fi signals received by different antennas to the soil permittivity and EC, which in turn depend on soil moisture and salinity. Our experiments with USRP, WARP, and commodity Wi-Fi cards show that Strobe can accurately estimate soil moisture and EC using Wi-Fi, thereby showing the potential of a future where a farmer can sense soil in their farm without investing 1000s of dollars in sensing tools.},

The VLC link is used to distribute a randomly generated secret key that can only be "observed" by VLC receivers that are physically in the same space as the transmitter. Each receiver is connected over a serial connection to an Android device; we developed applications for Android that take the key from the VLC receiver and subsequently use the key to encrypt or decrypt application data.

This paper presents the first characterization of AMP's impact on users' QoE. We do this using a corpus of over 2,100 AMP webpages, and their corresponding non-AMP counterparts, based on trendy-keyword-based searches. We characterized AMP's impact looking at common web QoE metrics, including Page Load Time, Time to First Byte and SpeedIndex (SI). Our results show that AMP significantly improves SI, yielding on average a 60% lower SI than non-AMP pages without accounting for prefetching. Prefetching of AMP pages pushes this advantage even further, with prefetched pages loading over 2,000ms faster than non-prefetched AMP pages. This clear boost may come, however, at a non-negligible cost for users with limited data plans as it incurs an average of over 1.4~MB of additional data downloaded, unbeknownst to users.},

Standards exist for access points (APs), to use a more holistic view of the RF environment, to share information with clients (802.11v/k), allowing clients to make better performance-impacting decisions, e.g. choosing to roam between APs. Standards intended to lower the cost of these expensive control-plane operations (802.11r) also exist. In this paper, we use large scale measurements to show the limited adoption of existing client-based techniques. We propose ClientMarshal for enterprise WLANs, which provides network infrastructure more control over these decisions without modification to client device software. ClientMarshal divides the enterprise network into logical groups called cells, each consisting of a small number of neighboring APs operating on different channels. All APs belonging to the same cell broadcast the same wireless identity (BSSID) to client devices, and appear as a single virtual AP. The key enabler behind ClientMarshal is FreeSteer (FST), a novel protocol we develop that allows an AP to dynamically steer an associated client to another AP in the same cell based on various network measurements in order to improve overall network performance. This design also improves the roaming experience by bypassing traditional control-plane operations, avoiding significant overhead as well as client implementation defects. Using systematic evaluation and implementation on commodity APs, we show the efficacy and control of FST protocol in client steering. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, FST can steer clients almost 2.5X faster, with 52% higher success rate, and reduce packet loss by more than 68%.},

Although environmentally friendly, the rapid promotion of electric taxis raises problems to both taxi drivers and governments, e.g., prolonged waiting/charging time, unbalanced utilization of charging infrastructures and reduced taxi supply due to the long charging time. In this paper, we make the first effort to understand the long-term evolving patterns through a five-year study on one of the largest electric taxi networks in the world, i.e., the Shenzhen electric taxi network in China. In particular, we perform a comprehensive measurement investigation called ePat to explore the evolving mobility and charging patterns of electric vehicles. Our ePat is based on 4.8 TB taxi GPS data, 240 GB taxi transaction data, and metadata from 117 charging stations, during an evolving process from 427 electric taxis in 2013 to 13,178 in 2018. Moreover, ePat also explores the impacts of various contexts and benefits during the evolving process. Our ePat as a comprehensive investigation of the electric taxi network mobility and charging evolving has the potential to advance the understanding of the evolving patterns of electric taxi networks and pave the way for analyzing future shared autonomous vehicles.},

	abstract     = {The popularity of 4K videos has grown significantly in the past few years. Yet coding and streaming live 4K videos incurs prohibitive cost to the network and end system. Motivated by this observation, we explore the feasibility of supporting live 4K video streaming over wireless networks using commodity devices. Given the high data rate requirement of 4K videos, 60 GHz is appealing, but its large and unpredictable throughput fluctuation makes it hard to provide desirable user experience. In particular, to support live 4K video streaming, we should (i) adapt to highly variable and unpredictable wireless throughput, (ii) support efficient 4K video coding on commodity devices. To this end, we propose a novel system, Jigsaw. It consists of (i) easy-to-compute layered video coding to seamlessly adapt to unpredictable wireless link fluctuations, (ii) efficient GPU implementation of video coding on commodity devices, and (iii) effectively leveraging both WiFi and WiGig through delayed video adaptation and smart scheduling. Using real experiments and emulation, we demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our system. Our results show that it improves PSNR by 6-15dB and improves SSIM by 0.011-0.217 over state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, even when throughput fluctuates widely between 0.2Gbps-2Gbps, it can achieve an average PSNR of 33dB.},

Unfortunately, most of the state-of-the-art sign recognition technologies are limited by either high energy consumption or expensive device costs and have a difficult time providing a real-time service in a daily-life environment. Inspired by previous works on motion detection with wearable devices, we propose Sign Speaker - a real-time, robust, and user-friendly American sign language recognition (ASLR) system with affordable and portable commodity mobile devices. SignSpeaker is deployed on a smartwatch along with a smartphone; the smartwatch collects the sign signals and the smartphone outputs translation through an inbuilt loudspeaker. We implement a prototype system and run a series of experiments that demonstrate the promising performance of our system. For example, the average translation time is approximately $1.1$ seconds for a sentence with eleven words. The average detection ratio and reliability of sign recognition are 99.2% and 99.5%, respectively. The average word error rate of continuous sentence recognition is 1.04% on average.},

	abstract     = {In recent years, convolutional networks have demonstrated unprecedented performance in the image restoration task of super-resolution (SR). SR entails the upscaling of a single low-resolution image in order to meet application-specific image quality demands and plays a key role in mobile devices. To comply with privacy regulations and reduce the overhead of cloud computing, executing SR models locally on-device constitutes a key alternative approach. Nevertheless, the excessive compute and memory requirements of SR workloads pose a challenge in mapping SR networks on resource-constrained mobile platforms. This work presents MobiSR, a novel framework for performing efficient super-resolution on-device. Given a target mobile platform, the proposed framework considers popular model compression techniques and traverses the design space to reach the highest performing trade-off between image quality and processing speed. At run time, a novel scheduler dispatches incoming image patches to the appropriate model-engine pair based on the patch's estimated upscaling difficulty in order to meet the required image quality with minimum processing latency. Quantitative evaluation shows that the proposed framework yields on-device SR designs that achieve an average speedup of 2.13x over highly-optimized parallel difficulty-unaware mappings and 4.79x over highly-optimized single compute engine implementations.},

Analysis of the resulting dataset poses unique challenges; methods in the status quo are tailored for specific spectrum-related applications (apps), and are ill equipped to process data of this magnitude. In this paper, we design BigSpec, a general-purpose framework that allows for fast processing of apps. The key idea is to reduce computation costs by performing computation extensively on compressed data that preserves signal features. Adhering to this guideline, we build solutions for three apps, i.e., energy detection, spatio-temporal spectrum estimation, and anomaly detection. These apps were chosen to highlight BigSpec's efficiency, scalability, and extensibility. To evaluate BigSpec's performance, we collect more than 1 terabyte of spectrum data spanning a year, across 300MHz-4GHz, covering 400 km2. Compared with baselines and prior works, we achieve 17\texttimes{} run time efficiency, sublinear rather than linear run time scalability, and extend the definition of anomaly to different domains (frequency &amp; spatio-temporal). We also obtain high-level insights from the data to provide valuable advice on future spectrum measurement and data analysis.},

Instead of generating data itself to transmit, a full duplex relay can forward the received signal while receiving it. It also has the opportunity to properly modify the signal before forwarding it, which has been explored to enable constructive and destructive full duplex relaying recently. With these designs, the signal through the full duplex relay could constructively or destructively add up with the signal from the direct link at the receiver side. As a result, the received signal power may be boosted or greatly reduced, compared with direct forwarding. In this paper, we do detailed analysis on whether such constructive and destructive full duplex relays are possible. We find that for OFDM signals, such relays can not be achieved if the additional latency of the relayed path is more than one sample time than the direct link. Our analysis and results challenge the assumptions on the relay latency requirements of previous works to realize such systems.},

Their combination of low power, long range, and deployment ease has motivated a flurry of research, including exciting results on backscatter and interference cancellation that further lower power budgets and increase capacity. But despite the interest, we argue that unlicensed LPWAN technologies can only serve a narrow class of Internet of Things applications due to two principal challenges: capacity and coexistence. We propose a metric, bit flux, to describe networks and applications in terms of throughput over a coverage area. Using bit flux, we find that the combination of low bit rate and long range restricts the use case of LPWANs to sparse sensing applications. Furthermore, this lack of capacity leads networks to use as much available bandwidth as possible, and a lack of coexistence mechanisms causes poor performance in the presence of multiple, independently-administered networks. We discuss a variety of techniques and approaches that could be used to address these two challenges and enable LPWANs to achieve the promise of ubiquitous connectivity.},

	abstract     = {The growing trend of multi-device ownerships creates a need and an opportunity to use applications across multiple devices. However, in general, the current app development and usage still remain within the single-device paradigm, falling far short of user expectations. For example, it is currently not possible for a user to dynamically partition an existing live streaming app with chatting capabilities across different devices, such that she watches her favorite broadcast on her smart TV while real-time chatting on her smartphone. In this paper, we present FLUID, a new Android-based multi-device platform that enables innovative ways of using multiple devices. FLUID aims to i) allow users to migrate or replicate individual user interfaces (UIs) of a single app on multiple devices (high flexibility), ii) require no additional development effort to support unmodified, legacy applications (ease of development), and iii) support a wide range of apps that follow the trend of using custom-made UIs (wide applicability). Previous approaches, such as screen mirroring, app migration, and customized apps utilizing multiple devices, do not satisfy those goals altogether. FLUID, on the other hand, meets the goals by carefully analyzing which UI states are necessary to correctly render UI objects, deploying only those states on different devices, supporting cross-device function calls transparently, and synchronizing the UI states of replicated UI objects across multiple devices. Our evaluation with 20 unmodified, real-world Android apps shows that FLUID can transparently support a wide range of apps and is fast enough for interactive use.},

QR codes are also gaining importance in the retail sector as a convenient mobile payment method. However, researchers have concerns regarding the security of QR codes, which leave users susceptible to financial loss or private information leakage. In this study, we addressed this issue by developing a novel QR code (called mQRCode), which exploits patterns presenting a specific spatial frequency as a form of camouflage. When the targeted receiver holds a camera in a designated position (e.g., directly in front at a distance of 30 cm from the camouflaged QR code), the original QR code is revealed in form of a Moire pattern. From any other position, only the camouflaged QR code can be seen. In experiments, the decryption rate of mQRCode was &gt; 98.6% within 10.2 frames via a multi-frame decryption method. The decryption rate for cameras positioned 20Â° off axis or &gt; 10cm away from the designated location dropped to 0%, indicating that mQRCode is robust against attacks.},

Today, this promising wireless communication technology plays an indispensable role as vehicles exchange low-latent safety critical messages with one another in a bid to make the road traffic more safer, efficient, and convenient. However, dissemination of malicious messages within the network not only significantly reduces the network performance but also becomes a source of threat for the passengers and vulnerable pedestrians. Accordingly, a number of trust models have been recently proposed in the literature to ensure the identification and elimination of malicious vehicles from the network. These trust models primarily rely on the aggregation of both direct and indirect observations and evict the malicious vehicles based on a particular threshold set on this composite trust value. Nevertheless, setting-up of this threshold poses a significant challenge especially owing to diverse influential factors in such a dynamic and distributed networking environment. To this end, in this manuscript, machine learning has been employed to compute the aggregate trust score for flagging and evicting of the malicious vehicles from a vehicular network. It is evident from the simulated results that the devised method is both accurate and scalable.},

	abstract     = {In order to improve the reliability of dynamic wireless LAN (WLAN) network systems such as a vehicular network system for traffic accident prevention, testing the system software is important. Network emulation enables to test the practical software of the system without building a physical network. Many existing network emulators are built by using a virtual Ethernet device named TUN/TAP device for enabling a network simulator to capture Ethernet frames. However, the network emulation with the TUN/TAP device cannot emulate the operation of the WLAN protocols such as ETSI DCC, which dynamically changes transmission power and interval based on receive signal strength indication (RSSI), because the TUN/TAP device cannot capture IEEE 802.11 frames and control parameters such as transmission power, RSSI. In previous work, we developed a wireless network tap device (wtap80211) and proposed a vehicular network emulator using wtap80211. In the demonstration, we will demonstrate the capability of our emulator using its prototype.},

This demo is the first to show that ultra-high radio frequency identification signals can be received by an AM radio receiver due to the presence of the nonlinearity effect in the AM receiver. Such a phenomenon allows the development of a previously infeasible cross-technology communication, called Tagcaster, which converts an ETC reader to an AM station for broadcasting short messages (e.g, charged-fees and traffic forecast) to drivers at tollbooths. The prototype of Tagcaster is designed, implemented and evaluated over four general and five vehicle-mounted AM receivers (e.g, Toyota, Audi, and Jetta).

Such an approach takes advantage of these tiny, highly efficient biological insects which are ubiquitous in many outdoor ecosystems, to essentially provide mobility for free. Doing so however requires addressing key technical challenges of power, size, weight and self-localization in order for the insects to perform location-dependent sensing operations as they carry our IoT payload through the environment. We develop and deploy our platform on bumblebees which includes backscatter communication, low-power self-localization hardware, sensors, and a power source. We show that our platform is capable of sensing, backscattering data at 1 kbps when the insects are back at the hive, and localizing itself up to distances of 80 m from the access points, all within a total weight budget of 102 mg.},

While there have been numerous reports on smartphone overheating, a systematic measurement and user experience study on the thermal aspect of smartphones is missing. Using thermal imaging cameras, we measure and analyze the temperatures of various smartphones running diverse application workloads such as voice calling, video recording, video chatting, and 3D online gaming. Our experiments show that running popular applications such as video chat, could raise the smartphone's surface temperature to over 50$^circ$C in only 10 minutes, which could easily cause thermal pain to users. Recent ubiquitous scenarios such as augmented reality and mobile deep learning also have considerable thermal issues. We then perform a user study to examine when the users perceive heat discomfort from the smartphones and how they react to overheating. Most of our user study participants reported considerable thermal discomfort while playing a mobile game, and that overheating disrupted interaction flows. With this in mind, we devise a smartphone surface temperature prediction model, by using only system statistics and internal sensor values. Our evaluation showed high prediction accuracy with root-mean-square errors of less than 2$^circ$C. We discuss several insights from our findings and recommendations for user experience, OS design, and developer support for better user-thermal interactions.},

In this paper, we explore the feasibility of the following re-search question:â¯?Can commodity Wi-Fi radios detect both the location and type of moving objects around them?". We present IntuWition, a complementary sensing system that can sense the location and type of material of objects in the environment, including those out of line-of-sight. It achieves this by sensing wireless signals reflected off surrounding objects using commodity Wi-Fi radios, whose signals penetrate walls and occlusions. At the core of IntuWition is the idea that different materials reflect and scatter polarized waves in different ways. We build upon ideas from RADAR Polarimetry to detect the material of objects across spatial locations, despite mobility of the sensing device and the hardware non-idealities of commodity Wi-Fi radios. A detailed feasibility study reveals an average accuracy of 95% in line-of-sight and 92% in non-line-of-sight in classifying five types of materials:copper, aluminum, plywood, birch, and human. Finally, we present a proof-of-concept application of our system on an autonomous UAV that uses its onboard Wi-Fi radios to sense whether an occlusion is a person versus another UAV.},

	abstract     = {Recent studies show that the voice control system (VCS) is subject to the inaudible voice command attack, which can not be heard by human ears but can be recorded by the microphone. An adversary could leverage the attack to disable the VCS user's home security system, leak the victim's privacy or download malware stealthily. Efforts have been dedicated to developing forensics based defense mechanisms, which target at detecting traces of the attack signal; however, we find that existing approaches of the kind still leave loopholes. Moreover, a complete defense mechanism should be able to not only detect the attack but also cancel out the attack signal, and meanwhile ensure the legitimate voice commands unaffected, which however is still unavailable to the best of our knowledge. This paper is an attempt to fill the gap. We first systematically analyze existing forensics based defense mechanisms and reveal the root cause of their loopholes. Then we present an active inaudible-voice-command cancellation (AIC) design, which can reliably detect and capture the attack signal facilitated by our custom-designed "guard'' signal transmitter. AIC can create a special spectrum in the passband of the VCS microphone, based on which we are able to neutralize the attack signal in software means. We implement a prototype of our defense system and conduct comprehensive experiments to validate our design.},

A recent finding demonstrates that ultrasound may be audible to the smart devices under certain conditions due to their microphone's nonlinearity. Inspired by this insight, this work revisits the ultrasonic positioning technique and builds a practical UPS, called UPS+, for ultrasound-incapable smart devices. The core concept is to deploy two types of indoor beacon devices, which will advertise ultrasonic beacons at two different ultrasonic frequencies respectively. Their superimposed beacons are shifted to a low-frequency by virtue of the nonlinearity effect at the receiver's microphone. This underlying property functions as an implicit ultrasonic downconverter without throwing harm to the hearing system of humans. We demonstrate UPS+, a fully functional UPS prototype, with centimeter-level localization accuracy using custom-made beacon hardware and well-designed algorithms.},

The design of TouchAuth is based on the electrostatics of iBEP generation and a resulting property, i.e., the iBEPs at two close locations on the same human body are similar, whereas those from different human bodies are distinct. Extensive experiments verify the above property and show that TouchAuth achieves high-profile receiver operating characteristics in implementing the touch-to-access policy. Our experiments also show that a range of possible interfering sources including appliances' electromagnetic emanations and noise injections into the power network do not affect the performance of TouchAuth. A key advantage of TouchAuth is that the iBEP sensing requires a simple analog-to-digital converter only, which is widely available on microcontrollers. Compared with existing approaches including intra-body communication and physiological sensing, TouchAuth is a low-cost, lightweight, and convenient approach for authorized users to access the smart objects found in indoor environments.},
