abstract = {Connecting with each other on the basis of research interests, geographies or identity has shown to be an important aspect of community development within HCI. The advent of a variety of committees and Special Interest Groups (SIG) are a testament to this need of connecting with each other. As members of the nascent SIGCHI LATAM committee, we see an opportunity in learning together with different communities across the HCI field about how we are working to attract more practitioners, academics, and students to work together and grow research surrounding HCI. With this SIG, we want to promote an environment for discussing and exchanging practices among different collectives within SIGCHI worldwide. We propose inviting community leaders from different geographies, sub-fields and identities to discuss their strategies and experiences growing their communities. The event is open to all members interested in gaining insight into how to grow communities within HCI.},

abstract = {This essay performs a speculative ethics in designing with a researcher’s own bodily fluids. This is through the creation of “performative texts”, which are autoethnographic accounts of past experiences in which written words perform through visual and spatial compositions alongside verbal readings aloud. I present three performative texts about moments of discomfort in designing with milk from my own breastfeeding relationship. They are to reflect upon felt experiences of potential harm and to understand social and material relations of care. From these I offer three possibilities for how HCI might consider the ethics of first-person research in attending to more-than-human entanglements: unsafe spaces, situated escapes, and censored inclusion. These possibilities and the approach of performative texts contribute to research for more sustainable futures by exploring the decentering of humans through an intimate engagement with the self.},

We explore possibilities of multiple insects as co-creation interfaces making artworks through insects indirectly, in contrast with BioArt where artworks are made by biological technology. Considering scalability, sustainability, or promotability of applying insects-based devices on creation activities in daily life situations, we utilize on-hand and efficient control system by AR markers and radio-based station, and propose efficient ways of controlling multiple insects reaching goals and transporting objects, and customize flexible option parts. In robust experimental trials, our results showed effective control on a group of three or five cockroaches with at-least 60% reaching accuracy, mobility on carpeted or cable-lines floor, and possible continuous control under certain time duration. Participants in a user study felt positive with Calmbots’ functions and expected more performance or appearance on activities or creation in daily life.},

The kit enables various assemblies to be made with the modular pieces, allowing creators to explore the world of soft robotics in playful ways. When combined with a FlowIO device, PneuBots allows seamless programmability of the different assemblies, enabling artists, designers, engineers, and makers to create dynamic, shape-changing, and interactive works that can be used for education, storytelling, dynamic art, or expression of affect and gratitude. In this paper, we present our current progress towards developing a soft robotics starter kit that is affordable, modular, programmable, and adaptable to users’ creative visions. Finally, we discuss some of our preliminary results with users who had the opportunity to try using PneuBots.},

However, those approaches have not thoroughly examined their own grounds of criticism. In this workshop, we deepen that critical view by turning a reflective lens on the HCI work itself that addresses data science. We invite new perspectives from the diverse research and practice traditions in the broader CHI community, and we hope to co-create a new research agenda that addresses both data science and human-centered approaches to data science.},

Through group discussion and collaborative speculation we will address questions such as: What are the relationships between digital technology and human emotion? What roles does emotion play in HCI research? How should HCI researchers conceptualize emotion? When should HCI researchers use interdisciplinary theories of emotion or create new theory? Can specific emotions be designed for, and where is this knowledge likely to be applied? What are the implications of emotion research for design, ethics and wellbeing? What is the future of emotion in human-computer interaction?},

This workshop will explicitly address the challenges of designing interactive aquatic systems with the aim of articulating the grand challenges faced by WaterHCI. We will first map user experiences around water based on participants’ personal experiences with water and interactive technology. Building on those experiences, we then discuss specific challenges when designing interactive aquatic experiences.

In this workshop we will adopt an ecosystems perspective to better understand the nature of complex needs and how to support the management of those needs through holistic and multi-faceted support. Using a hands-on design sprint technique, participants will (1) map out different complex care ecosystems, (2) generate ideas for technologies, services, and other multi-faceted interventions to address gaps in those ecosystems, and (3) choose the most promising ideas to further develop and refine. We will close by reflecting together on what we have created, our approaches to design, and the theories and concepts that shaped our approaches. Through this process, we will collectively generate an agenda for research and design to better support the management of complex health needs.},

These research fields often use soft, flexible materials with elastic actuation mechanisms to build systems that are more adaptable, compliant, and suitable for a very broad range of environments. However, at the intersection between HCI and the aforementioned domains, there are numerous challenges related to fabrication methods, development tools, resource availability,&nbsp;nomenclature, design for inclusion, etc. This workshop aims to explore how to make Soft Robotics more accessible to both researchers and nonresearchers alike.

abstract = {Virtual reality provides great opportunities to simulate various environments and situations as reproducible and controllable training environments. Training is an inherently collaborative effort, with trainees and trainers working together to achieve specific goals. Recently, we have seen considerable effort to use virtual training environments (VTEs) in many demanding training contexts, e.g. police training, medical first responder training, firefighter training etc. For such contexts, trainers and trainees must undertake various roles as supervisors, adaptors, role players, and observers in training, making collaboration complex, but essential for training success. These social and multi-user aspects for collaborative VTEs have received little investigation so far. Therefore, we propose this workshop to discuss the potential and perspectives of VTEs for challenging training settings. In a one-day online workshop, researchers and practitioners will jointly develop a research agenda on how currently underrepresented aspects of social and collaborative work can be integrated into VR-supported training. This workshop will focus on two themes: (1) Multi-sensory experience: novel collaborative interfaces for VTEs (e.g. joint use of tangible devices, strategies for preventing simulator-induced negative effects); (2) Multi-user interaction: collaboration in VTEs between trainers (two trainers run a scenarios jointly), trainers and trainees /the trainer controls the scenario for a trainee), and trainees with each other (e.g. two trainees solve an exercise together)},

As the Asian CHI community grows to be more diverse than when we started in 2015, there is a need to address the issues of equity, justice, access, and transparency more strategically, especially with a historical link to colonialism in Asia. Beyond showcasing the latest Asian-inspired HCI work and those focusing on incorporating Asian sociocultural factors in their design, implementation, evaluation, and improvement, the Asian CHI Symposium 2022 is a sandbox for decolonizing yet academically rigorous discourse platform for both HCI academic and UX practitioners to present their latest research findings and solutions that reflect the expansion of HCI theory and applications towards culturally inclusive design for diverse audiences in Asia.},

abstract = {Building on the prior workshops on conversational user interfaces (CUIs) [2, 40], we tackle the topic of ethics of CUIs at CHI 2022. Though commercial CUI developments continue to rapidly advance, our scholarly dialogue on ethics of CUIs is underwhelming. The CUI community has implicitly been concerned with ethics, yet making it central to the growing body of work thus far has not been adequately done. Since ethics is a far-reaching topic, perspectives from philosophy, design, and engineering domains are integral to our CUI research community. For instance, philosophical traditions, e.g., deontology or virtue ethics, can guide ethical concepts that are relevant for CUIs, e.g., autonomy or trust. The practice of design through approaches like value sensitive design can inform how CUIs should be developed. Ethics comes into play with technical contributions, e.g., privacy-preserving data sharing between conversational systems. By considering such multidisciplinary angles, we come to a special topic of interest that ties together philosophy, design, and engineering: conversational disclosure, e.g., sharing personal information, transparency, e.g., as how to transparently convey relevant information in a conversational manner, and vulnerability of diverse user groups that should be taken into consideration.},

abstract = {The LilyTiny sewable microcontroller was created ten years ago, in an effort to make electronic textiles more accessible. At the time, e-textiles was gaining traction as a means to invite more diverse participation in computing, but financial and instructional barriers stood in the way of broader adoption. In addition, there existed a scaffolding gap between projects involving lights, batteries, and thread – and those requiring programming (i.e. leveraging the LilyPad Arduino and/or additional sensors or outputs). In an effort to expand access to electronic textiles, we designed the LilyTiny, an inexpensive, pre-programmed sewable microcontroller which controls assorted LED patterns, and which later became available for purchase through SparkFun. Alongside the LilyTiny, we released a free workshop guide for educators which details five low-cost activities that can be taught without any prior electronics experience. This paper summarizes our development of the LilyTiny and companion curriculum – and reflects on whether we met our stated goal of expanding access to electronic textiles in the decade since. We share and discuss some measures of impact, including a survey of derivative products and a multi-year analysis of sales data from the LilyTiny’s sole distributor SparkFun Electronics.},

People's beliefs in their capabilities are a relevant component in human action, also affecting the motivation to participate. In this paper, we report the results of a study on the possibilities of an eParticipation platform to a) enhance the users’ self-efficacy in the context of societal participation, and b) lower the threshold of societal participation. Altogether, 34 young people from various backgrounds participated in Virtual Council field tests to collaborate on the Climate Change Act in Finland. The results suggest that eParticipation platforms can enhance the societal participation self-efficacy of youths that initially have less experience participating in societal issues. Furthermore, the threshold of participation can be lowered after using the eParticipation platform. The paper adds to the growing discussion on connections between youths use of digital services and societal participation.},

We postulate and present some evidence that this difference is due to employees implicitly comparing B2B with B2C e-commerce sites and therefore expecting the experience of a B2C site for a B2B site. Such a comparison, fosters a bias, which has implications for businesses that host B2B e-commerce sites. We conclude by sketching recommendations for practitioners on how to go about such a bias.},

We acknowledge an amplification of this trend through recent technological developments that aim toward human-computer integration, and explore the dark patterns that may arise for integrating emotions with machinic processes through “machine_in_the_middle”. Machine_in_the_middle is an interactive system in which a participant wears an electroencephalographic headset, and their neural activity is analysed to ascertain an approximation of their emotional state. Using electrical muscle stimulation their face is animated into an expression that corresponds with the output of the emotional recognition system. Through our work, we contribute the insight of three possible dark patterns that might emerge from emotional integration, including: reductionism of human emotion, disruptions of agency, and parasitic symbiosis. We hope that these insights inspire researchers and practitioners to approach human-computer integration more cautiously.},

abstract = {Collecting accurate and fine-grain information about the music people like, dislike and actually listen to has long been a challenge for sociologists. As millions of people now use online music streaming services, research can build upon the individual listening history data that are collected by these platforms. Individual interviews, in particular, can benefit from such data, by allowing the interviewers to immerse themselves in the musical universe of consenting respondents, and thus ask them contextualized questions and get more precise answers. Designing a visual exploration tool allowing such an immersion is however difficult, because of the volume and heterogeneity of the listening data, the unequal “visual literacy” of the prospective users, or the interviewers’ potential lack of knowledge of the music listened to by the respondents. In this case study we discuss the design and evaluation of such a tool. Designed with social scientists, its purpose is to help them in preparing and conducting semi-structured interviews that address various aspects of the listening experience. It was evaluated during thirty interviews with consenting users of a streaming platform in France.},

The approach is optimal for UX and market research, but is also easily employed as a structured decision-making exercise outside of consumer research. We describe how the numeric forced rank was used to determine the name of a new Google Cloud Platform (GCP) feature, present the findings, and make recommendations for future research.},

abstract = {Our everyday digital tasks require access to information from a wide range of applications and systems. Although traditional search systems can help find information, they usually operate within one application (e.g., email client or web browser) and require the user’s cognitive effort and attention to formulate proper search queries. In this paper, we demonstrate EntityBot, a system that proactively provides useful and supporting entities across application boundaries without requiring explicit query formulation. Our methodology is to exploit the context from screen frames captured every 2 seconds to recommend relevant entities for the current task. Recommendations are not restricted to only documents but include various kinds of entities, such as applications, documents, contact persons, and keywords representing the tasks. Recommendations are actionable, that is, a user can perform actions on recommended entities, such as opening documents and applications. The EntityBot also includes support for interactivity, allowing the user to affect the recommendations by providing explicit feedback on the entities. The usefulness of entity recommendations and their impact on user behavior has been evaluated in a user study based on real-world tasks. Quantitative and qualitative results suggest that the system had an actual impact on the tasks and led to high user satisfaction.},

Given a pre-defined key-finger mapping, our text entry decoder fuses these predictions with the character priors of an n-gram language model to decode the input text entered by the user. TapType combines high portability with sustained rapid bimanual input across the full space, which we demonstrate at the example of supplementing text input on mobile touch devices, in eyes-free scenarios using audio feedback, and in a situated Mixed Reality scenario to enable typing outside visual control with passive haptic feedback.},

As German journalist and pacifist Kurt Tukholsky once said: “The death of one man is a tragedy, the death of millions is a statistic”. When we look back at the help-seeking posts of those who were lost, those who died of unconfirmed COVID-19 testing reports; those who committed suicide out of despair; those whose life-saving medical equipment were being taken away and those who lost their lives due to overwork and infection from their patients... Many of them were not included in the official statistics, and they are likely to be forgotten over time. They were not being treated fairly when they were alive, and they were not being mentioned after they passed away. We spoke to one of those families. One daughter said: “After this pandemic, who will remember someone such as my mother – she had nowhere to go for medical treatment; she was rejected by the hospital, and she had to die at home?” This is one of the reasons why we built this online platform. We want to document as many people who have left us because of the pandemic as possible. Our website also includes the help-seeking information these people posted before they passed away. These are the evidences they have left in a particular moment in this pandemic. We hope to provide a space for family members to express their grief and for the public to mourn the dead.

abstract = {Despite ever improving digital ink and paper solutions, many people still prefer printing out documents for close reading, proofreading, or filling out forms. However, in order to incorporate paper-based annotations into digital workflows, handwritten text and markings need to be extracted. Common computer-vision and machine-learning approaches require extensive sets of training data or a clean digital version of the document. We propose a simple method for extracting handwritten annotations from laser-printed documents using multispectral imaging. While black toner absorbs infrared light, most inks are invisible in the infrared spectrum. We modified an off-the-shelf flatbed scanner by adding a switchable infrared LED to its light guide. By subtracting an infrared scan from a color scan, handwritten text and highlighting can be extracted and added to a PDF version. Initial experiments show accurate results with high quality on a test data set of 93 annotated pages. Thus, infrared scanning seems like a promising building block for integrating paper-based and digital annotation practices.},

This can lead to negative social repercussions such as cyberbullying. This work investigates the most memorable SIPMs on Facebook for Egyptian users and their impact on platform usage. We conducted an online survey (N=53) requesting critical incident reports about surprising Facebook SIPMs. The most remembered SIPMs were: customizing advertisements, cuing offline interactions, sharing data with third parties and personalizing the newsfeed. Our results suggest that SIPMs, particularly customized advertisements act as ambient memory augmentation solutions to the users’ shared memories. Additionally, negative platform perception does not necessarily translate into reduction of platform usage.

In this paper, we analyze the effects of a specific type of crisis event on Reddit: sudden spikes in attention received by a community due to a post from the subreddit hitting r/popular—the default feed that aggregates the most popular content on Reddit. Our results show that r/popular is a source of potential disruptions due to the higher number of comments, authors, and especially removed comments found compared to threads that do not reach r/popular. When looking at r/popular’s effects across subreddits, large communities’ commenting and posting behaviors were less impacted by r/popular threads compared to smaller communities. However, similar-sized subreddits had substantial variations in how their commenting and posting activities were influenced by an r/popular thread. Understanding the causal factors behind these differences has implications for online governance, as well as fostering resilient and healthy communities.},

abstract = {The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has impacted our everyday lives and demands everyone to take countermeasures such as wearing masks or disinfecting their hands. However, while previous work suggests that these countermeasures may profoundly impact biometric authentication, an investigation of the actual impact is still missing. Hence, in this work, we present our findings from an online survey (n=334) on experienced changes in device usage and failures of authentication. Our results show significant changes in personal and shared device usage, as well as a significant increase in experienced failures when comparing the present situation to before the Covid-19 pandemic. From our qualitative analysis of participants’ responses, we derive potential reasons for these changes in device usage and increases in authentication failures. Our findings suggest that making authentication contactless is only one of the aspects relevant to encounter the novel challenges caused by the pandemic.},

abstract = {Laparoscopic surgeries require a high degree of visuo-spatial coordination between attending and resident surgeons. The challenge is intensified when surgeons communicate verbally using visual cues. Most prior work in the space supports attending surgeons to give clearer instructions to residents. However, in order to achieve intraoperative success, shared understanding, coordination and trust between faculty-resident dyads is essential. Our work focuses on unpacking both attending and resident surgeons’ experiences during intraoperative operations. We perform an interview study with 6 attending and 3 resident surgeons, in which we ask participants to share their thoughts on the utility and feasibility of capturing surgical dyads’ joint visual attention (JVA) during live surgeries. We find that attending and resident surgeons have contrasting and complementary views about autonomy, communication and coordination during surgeries. We also see positive attitudes towards capturing surgeons’ visual attention during live surgeries and using the data to support communication, coordination and instruction.},

The capacity of virtual reality (VR) to visualize and interactively simulate the unique lunar environment makes it a potentially powerful design tool during the early development stages of EL3, as well as other relevant technologies. Based on input from the EL3 development team, we have produced a VR-based operational scenario featuring a hypothetical configuration of the lander. Relying on HCI research methods, we have subsequently evaluated this scenario with relevant experts (n=10). Qualitative findings from this initial pilot study have demonstrated the usefulness of VR as a design tool in this context, but likewise surfaced a number of limitations in the form of potentially impaired validity and generalizability. We conclude by outlining our future research plan and reflect on the potential use of physical stimuli to improve the validity of VR-based simulations in forthcoming design activities.},

Group selfies, in particular, encourage people to represent their identity as part of the group and foster a sense of belonging. During the COVID-19 pandemic, video conferencing systems are used as a tool for group selfies. However, conventional systems are not ideal for group selfies due to the rigidness of grid-based layout, information overload, and lack of eye contact. To explore design opportunities and needs for a novel virtual group selfie platform, we conducted a participatory design, and identified three characteristics of virtual group selfie scenarios, “context with narratives”, “interactive group tasks”, and “capturing subtle moments.” We implemented Virfie, a web-based platform that enables users to take group selfies with embodied social interaction, and to create and customize selfie scenarios using a novel JSON specification. In order to validate our design concept and identify usability issues we conducted a user study. Feedbacks from the study participants suggest that Virfie is effective at strengthening social interaction and remote togetherness.},

We conducted a focus group study with four HCI students to understand the current behaviour of students during breaks between classes. Based on these insights we designed two AR interventions: AR Exergame, an interactive game that requires the user to move their hands to grab virtual apples; AR micro-movements, a method that requires the user to switch to a different physical space when starting a new virtual class. These AR interventions were aimed at encouraging students to perform micro-activities in between virtual classes, i.e. small non-strenuous activities. The effectiveness of these methods to reduce video conferencing fatigue, a.k.a Zoom fatigue, and also to compare it with the students current methods was tested through a user study with six participants.},

We draw implications for the science and practice of Human-Computer Interaction regarding new interactive environments enabled by the technologies of AmI and AR used conjointly.},

abstract = {Mobile navigation has become a ubiquitous technology through mobile devices and smartphones. One of these devices’ most-used navigation methods is the turn-by-turn method, first used in car-based navigation systems. However, pedestrians and cyclists increasingly use other methods such as the as-the-crow-flies (ATCF) navigation method instead of the classical turn-by-turn navigation. Instead of giving fixed instruction, ATCF navigation only indicates the straight-line direction to the destination and users have to make their own decision when and where to turn. In this paper, we improve the route predictions for such alternative navigation methods as ATFC by incorporating a model on users’ angle estimation error. We show that the route predictions are closer to actual human navigation behavior than methods proposed in related work.},

Seamful visualization promises a fresh perspective on visualization design as we seek to find more expressive encodings and novel approaches to representing data that acknowledge their wider qualities and limitations. By consulting seams in other realms and exploring existing seams and seamfulness in visualization, this paper offers a foundation for conceptualizing seamful visualization, points towards the value of seams and seamfulness in critical visualization, and proposes principles for engaging with seamful visualization in practice and research.},

The majority of these results either originate from controlled laboratory studies, or protocols relying on subjective self-reporting, reducing their ecological validity. This paper presents results from a full day in situ study investigating the impact of perceiving one’s smartphone notifications on wrist motion patterns. Through this objective behavioral assessment, we document for the first time the manifestations of notification-induced disruption outside of the lab, independently of user activity and without the need for self-reporting. We identified a decrease in wrist motion activity following the presentation of a notification while the participant was engaged in higher intensity activities, independently of whether the notification is immediately attended to. These findings provide objective support for the claim that notifications have as much potential for disruption when merely perceived as they do when the user actually responds to them.},

However, the HCI community is still in search for more intuitive text entry methods for smart devices. In this study, we explore a new text entry method—AcousticType for smart devices where a smartwatch is leveraged to infer what a user is typing on a physical keyboard employing the acoustic signals as a secondary input mechanism. AcousticType employs four modules: Noise Cancelling, Keystroke Detection, Key Identification and Word Correction. Our results show AcousticType recovers up to 98% of the typed text. We also showed that utilizing the noise cancellation, AcousticType is robust to the changes in the environment, which further boosts the practicality. The findings are promising and call for further investigation into new types of text entry methods that utilize acoustic signals to cope with the usability issues in smart devices.},

Our implementation of TVC includes three different comparison modes, namely SideBySide, Overlay, and Differences. Furthermore, we discuss the anticipated use, opportunities, and challenges of using TVC in the future for individual users as well as for asynchronous collaborative work.},

For this, we developed a digital thimble that users wear in their index finger. The thimble uses an optical sensor to track the finger and a pressure sensor to detect touch and contact force. In a week-long in-the-wild pilot study, Shapeshifter yielded on average 11 wpm on flat surfaces (e.g., a desk) and 9 wpm on the lap when sitting down, and 8 wpm on the palm and back of the hand when standing up in text composition tasks. A simulation study predicted a 27.3 wpm error-free text entry rate for novice users in transcription typing tasks on a desk.},

abstract = {As demonstrated by users’ resistance to ads on Google Home in 2017, persuasive communications from voice assistants (VAs) can be seen as inappropriate. But, they may be better received if the VAs are not the sources but mere media for ads, as happens with radio. User motives may play a role as well, with those who use VAs primarily for information resenting ads more than those who see their VAs as social companions. To test such propositions, we conducted a scenario-based user study (N = 264) in which Siri acted as either a source of ads or as a medium for delivering ads by a human spokesperson. Findings suggest that for informationally motivated users, Siri as ad source causes reactance via lowered sense of control over the interaction. On the other hand, for those with social motives, it increases social presence and positively affects user experience of the interaction.},
