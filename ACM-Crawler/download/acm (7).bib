abstract = {We demonstrate a mobile text entry system that brings full-size ten-finger typing to everyday surfaces, allowing users to type anywhere. Our wearable wristband TapType integrates accelerometers that sense vibrations arising from finger taps against a passive surface, from which our Bayesian neural network estimates a probability distribution over the fingers of the hand. Given a pre-defined key-finger mapping, our text entry decoder fuses these predictions with the character priors of an n-gram language model to decode the input text entered by the user. TapType combines high portability with sustained rapid bimanual input across the full space, which we demonstrate at the example of supplementing text input on mobile touch devices, in eyes-free scenarios using audio feedback, and in a situated Mixed Reality scenario to enable typing outside visual control with passive haptic feedback.},

abstract = {As COVID-19 spreads across the globe and the number of deaths continues to rise, the heartbreaking experiences are being replaced by collective mourning. As German journalist and pacifist Kurt Tukholsky once said: “The death of one man is a tragedy, the death of millions is a statistic”. When we look back at the help-seeking posts of those who were lost, those who died of unconfirmed COVID-19 testing reports; those who committed suicide out of despair; those whose life-saving medical equipment were being taken away and those who lost their lives due to overwork and infection from their patients... Many of them were not included in the official statistics, and they are likely to be forgotten over time. They were not being treated fairly when they were alive, and they were not being mentioned after they passed away. We spoke to one of those families. One daughter said: “After this pandemic, who will remember someone such as my mother – she had nowhere to go for medical treatment; she was rejected by the hospital, and she had to die at home?” This is one of the reasons why we built this online platform. We want to document as many people who have left us because of the pandemic as possible. Our website also includes the help-seeking information these people posted before they passed away. These are the evidences they have left in a particular moment in this pandemic. We hope to provide a space for family members to express their grief and for the public to mourn the dead. Behind every number is a life. ”Unfinished Farewell” can be viewed at www.farewell.care and www.jiabaoli.org/covid19},

Three stools on caster wheels generate sound and image around them in response to sitting on them, and moving and rotating relative to each other. In this paper, we identify the challenges of stranger interactions, introduce our cyber-physical system, and describe and demonstrate three interaction situations: sitting, moving closer and away from each other, and rotating to face or turn away from each other. By translating these interactions into visual and auditory effects, we explore the possibilities of merging the socio-physical world with a digital system to create unique social affordances for interpersonal interactions that foster togetherness. Our demonstration transforms three strangers into a trio of sound-and-image makers interacting through creative, embodied play.},

abstract = {Despite ever improving digital ink and paper solutions, many people still prefer printing out documents for close reading, proofreading, or filling out forms. However, in order to incorporate paper-based annotations into digital workflows, handwritten text and markings need to be extracted. Common computer-vision and machine-learning approaches require extensive sets of training data or a clean digital version of the document. We propose a simple method for extracting handwritten annotations from laser-printed documents using multispectral imaging. While black toner absorbs infrared light, most inks are invisible in the infrared spectrum. We modified an off-the-shelf flatbed scanner by adding a switchable infrared LED to its light guide. By subtracting an infrared scan from a color scan, handwritten text and highlighting can be extracted and added to a PDF version. Initial experiments show accurate results with high quality on a test data set of 93 annotated pages. Thus, infrared scanning seems like a promising building block for integrating paper-based and digital annotation practices.},

Our findings revealed that the participants’ flavor perceptions are augmented based on different video content, indicating significant differences in their perceived taste sensations (e.g., increased perception of salty and spicy sensations). Furthermore, potential future implications are revealed to promote digital commensality and healthier eating habits.},

Prior work shows that users are still unable to understand how their shared memories are used by smart systems to create Smart Interactions involving Personal Memories (SIPMs). This can lead to negative social repercussions such as cyberbullying. This work investigates the most memorable SIPMs on Facebook for Egyptian users and their impact on platform usage. We conducted an online survey (N=53) requesting critical incident reports about surprising Facebook SIPMs. The most remembered SIPMs were: customizing advertisements, cuing offline interactions, sharing data with third parties and personalizing the newsfeed. Our results suggest that SIPMs, particularly customized advertisements act as ambient memory augmentation solutions to the users’ shared memories. Additionally, negative platform perception does not necessarily translate into reduction of platform usage. Our work inspires the discussion about users expectations towards ambient usage of their data on smart memory vaults.},

Regardless of whether these communities are small groups or entire platforms, the ability to handle disruptions during volatile periods signifies the resilience of a community. In this paper, we analyze the effects of a specific type of crisis event on Reddit: sudden spikes in attention received by a community due to a post from the subreddit hitting r/popular—the default feed that aggregates the most popular content on Reddit. Our results show that r/popular is a source of potential disruptions due to the higher number of comments, authors, and especially removed comments found compared to threads that do not reach r/popular. When looking at r/popular’s effects across subreddits, large communities’ commenting and posting behaviors were less impacted by r/popular threads compared to smaller communities. However, similar-sized subreddits had substantial variations in how their commenting and posting activities were influenced by an r/popular thread. Understanding the causal factors behind these differences has implications for online governance, as well as fostering resilient and healthy communities.},

However, while previous work suggests that these countermeasures may profoundly impact biometric authentication, an investigation of the actual impact is still missing. Hence, in this work, we present our findings from an online survey (n=334) on experienced changes in device usage and failures of authentication. Our results show significant changes in personal and shared device usage, as well as a significant increase in experienced failures when comparing the present situation to before the Covid-19 pandemic. From our qualitative analysis of participants’ responses, we derive potential reasons for these changes in device usage and increases in authentication failures. Our findings suggest that making authentication contactless is only one of the aspects relevant to encounter the novel challenges caused by the pandemic.},

abstract = {Laparoscopic surgeries require a high degree of visuo-spatial coordination between attending and resident surgeons. The challenge is intensified when surgeons communicate verbally using visual cues. Most prior work in the space supports attending surgeons to give clearer instructions to residents. However, in order to achieve intraoperative success, shared understanding, coordination and trust between faculty-resident dyads is essential. Our work focuses on unpacking both attending and resident surgeons’ experiences during intraoperative operations. We perform an interview study with 6 attending and 3 resident surgeons, in which we ask participants to share their thoughts on the utility and feasibility of capturing surgical dyads’ joint visual attention (JVA) during live surgeries. We find that attending and resident surgeons have contrasting and complementary views about autonomy, communication and coordination during surgeries. We also see positive attitudes towards capturing surgeons’ visual attention during live surgeries and using the data to support communication, coordination and instruction.},

The capacity of virtual reality (VR) to visualize and interactively simulate the unique lunar environment makes it a potentially powerful design tool during the early development stages of EL3, as well as other relevant technologies. Based on input from the EL3 development team, we have produced a VR-based operational scenario featuring a hypothetical configuration of the lander. Relying on HCI research methods, we have subsequently evaluated this scenario with relevant experts (n=10). Qualitative findings from this initial pilot study have demonstrated the usefulness of VR as a design tool in this context, but likewise surfaced a number of limitations in the form of potentially impaired validity and generalizability. We conclude by outlining our future research plan and reflect on the potential use of physical stimuli to improve the validity of VR-based simulations in forthcoming design activities.},

abstract = {Selfies have become a prominent means of online communication. Group selfies, in particular, encourage people to represent their identity as part of the group and foster a sense of belonging. During the COVID-19 pandemic, video conferencing systems are used as a tool for group selfies. However, conventional systems are not ideal for group selfies due to the rigidness of grid-based layout, information overload, and lack of eye contact. To explore design opportunities and needs for a novel virtual group selfie platform, we conducted a participatory design, and identified three characteristics of virtual group selfie scenarios, “context with narratives”, “interactive group tasks”, and “capturing subtle moments.” We implemented Virfie, a web-based platform that enables users to take group selfies with embodied social interaction, and to create and customize selfie scenarios using a novel JSON specification. In order to validate our design concept and identify usability issues we conducted a user study. Feedbacks from the study participants suggest that Virfie is effective at strengthening social interaction and remote togetherness.},

Based on these insights we designed two AR interventions: AR Exergame, an interactive game that requires the user to move their hands to grab virtual apples; AR micro-movements, a method that requires the user to switch to a different physical space when starting a new virtual class. These AR interventions were aimed at encouraging students to perform micro-activities in between virtual classes, i.e. small non-strenuous activities. The effectiveness of these methods to reduce video conferencing fatigue, a.k.a Zoom fatigue, and also to compare it with the students current methods was tested through a user study with six participants.},

abstract = {Mobile navigation has become a ubiquitous technology through mobile devices and smartphones. One of these devices’ most-used navigation methods is the turn-by-turn method, first used in car-based navigation systems. However, pedestrians and cyclists increasingly use other methods such as the as-the-crow-flies (ATCF) navigation method instead of the classical turn-by-turn navigation. Instead of giving fixed instruction, ATCF navigation only indicates the straight-line direction to the destination and users have to make their own decision when and where to turn. In this paper, we improve the route predictions for such alternative navigation methods as ATFC by incorporating a model on users’ angle estimation error. We show that the route predictions are closer to actual human navigation behavior than methods proposed in related work.},

Seamful visualization promises a fresh perspective on visualization design as we seek to find more expressive encodings and novel approaches to representing data that acknowledge their wider qualities and limitations. By consulting seams in other realms and exploring existing seams and seamfulness in visualization, this paper offers a foundation for conceptualizing seamful visualization, points towards the value of seams and seamfulness in critical visualization, and proposes principles for engaging with seamful visualization in practice and research.},

The majority of these results either originate from controlled laboratory studies, or protocols relying on subjective self-reporting, reducing their ecological validity. This paper presents results from a full day in situ study investigating the impact of perceiving one’s smartphone notifications on wrist motion patterns. Through this objective behavioral assessment, we document for the first time the manifestations of notification-induced disruption outside of the lab, independently of user activity and without the need for self-reporting. We identified a decrease in wrist motion activity following the presentation of a notification while the participant was engaged in higher intensity activities, independently of whether the notification is immediately attended to. These findings provide objective support for the claim that notifications have as much potential for disruption when merely perceived as they do when the user actually responds to them.},

abstract = {The integration of various technologies with our daily lives, such as smartwatches, smartphones, smart TVs, etc. has proven beneficial. However, the HCI community is still in search for more intuitive text entry methods for smart devices. In this study, we explore a new text entry method—AcousticType for smart devices where a smartwatch is leveraged to infer what a user is typing on a physical keyboard employing the acoustic signals as a secondary input mechanism. AcousticType employs four modules: Noise Cancelling, Keystroke Detection, Key Identification and Word Correction. Our results show AcousticType recovers up to 98% of the typed text. We also showed that utilizing the noise cancellation, AcousticType is robust to the changes in the environment, which further boosts the practicality. The findings are promising and call for further investigation into new types of text entry methods that utilize acoustic signals to cope with the usability issues in smart devices.},

Currently, CUIs are mainly applied to help improve the user experience with quantitative surveys. We describe the development of a Hybrid User Interface (HUI) prototype that combines a Graphical User interface (GUI) and a CUI to conduct a fully automated but structured qualitative survey according to the Repertory Grid Technique (RGT). This paper describes a pilot study that we conducted to inform the design of the HUI and to converge to a prototype that is sufficiently mature and robust to be used in a more extensive follow-up study. Our experiences with developing this HUI may help others avoid pitfalls and profit from the tools and lessons we have learned as part of our design process.},

This makes it challenging to keep track of changes and developments in iterative physical design. In this paper, we propose the concept of Tangible Version Control (TVC), inspired by the visualizations of traditional version control systems. In TVC, the real-world artifact itself is used for exploring its alternative versions in physical space, while comparisons to an alternative version are displayed seamlessly on the artifact with the use of augmented reality. Our implementation of TVC includes three different comparison modes, namely SideBySide, Overlay, and Differences. Furthermore, we discuss the anticipated use, opportunities, and challenges of using TVC in the future for individual users as well as for asynchronous collaborative work.},

We present Shapeshifter, a technique that enables text entry in virtual reality by performing gestures and fluctuating contact force on any opaque diffusely reflective surface, including the human body. For this, we developed a digital thimble that users wear in their index finger. The thimble uses an optical sensor to track the finger and a pressure sensor to detect touch and contact force. In a week-long in-the-wild pilot study, Shapeshifter yielded on average 11 wpm on flat surfaces (e.g., a desk) and 9 wpm on the lap when sitting down, and 8 wpm on the palm and back of the hand when standing up in text composition tasks. A simulation study predicted a 27.3 wpm error-free text entry rate for novice users in transcription typing tasks on a desk.},

abstract = {As demonstrated by users’ resistance to ads on Google Home in 2017, persuasive communications from voice assistants (VAs) can be seen as inappropriate. But, they may be better received if the VAs are not the sources but mere media for ads, as happens with radio. User motives may play a role as well, with those who use VAs primarily for information resenting ads more than those who see their VAs as social companions. To test such propositions, we conducted a scenario-based user study (N = 264) in which Siri acted as either a source of ads or as a medium for delivering ads by a human spokesperson. Findings suggest that for informationally motivated users, Siri as ad source causes reactance via lowered sense of control over the interaction. On the other hand, for those with social motives, it increases social presence and positively affects user experience of the interaction.},

abstract = {Requesters on crowdsourcing platforms like Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) compensate workers inadequately. One potential reason for the underpayment is that the AMT’s requester interface provides limited information about estimated wages, preventing requesters from knowing if they are offering a fair piece-rate reward. To assess if presenting wage information affects requesters’ reward setting behaviors, we conducted a controlled study with 63 participants. We had three levels for a between-subjects factor in a mixed design study, where we provided participants with: no wage information, wage point estimate, and wage distribution. Each participant had three stages of adjusting the reward and controlling the estimated wage. Our analysis with Bayesian growth curve modeling suggests that the estimated wage derived from the participant-set reward increased from $2.56/h to $2.69/h and $2.33/h to $2.74/h when we provided point estimate and distribution information respectively. The wage decreased from $2.06/h to $1.99/h in the control condition.},

Given text-based communication being the main channel for virtual collaboration, we propose a novel solution leveraging an AI-based, dynamic affective recognition system. The app provides live feedback about the affective content of the communication in Slack, in the form of a visual representation and percentage breakdown of the ‘sentiment’ (tone, emoji) and main ‘emotion states’ (e.g. joy, anger). We tested the usability of the app in a quasi-experiment with 30 participants from diverse backgrounds, linguistic analysis and user interviews. The findings show that the app significantly increases shared understanding and creativity within virtual teams. Emerged themes included impression formation assisted by affective recognition, supporting long-term relationships development; identified challenges related to transparency and emotional complexity detected by AI.},

We interviewed 10 older adults living in an assisted living community in the U.S. to explore their values around AI for health. Findings show that they value technologies that generate and share positive and relational health information. We use this emphasis on positive health representations to speculate on a critical refusal of negative health representations. We highlight this preference in contrast to existing deficit-based health tracking technologies for aging and discuss how researchers, developers, and designers can engage in better approaches to AI-driven health for older adults and other historically marginalized populations.},

In this paper, we argue that crowdworking platforms sell temporal flexibility to requesters to the detriment of workers. We begin by identifying a list of 19 features employed by crowdworking platforms that facilitate the trade of temporal flexibility from crowdworkers to requesters. Using the list of features, we conduct a comparative analysis of nine crowdworking platforms available to U.S.-based workers, in which we describe key differences and similarities between the platforms. We find that crowdworking platforms strongly favour features that promote requesters’ temporal flexibility over workers’ by limiting the predictability of workers’ working hours and restricting paid time. Further, we identify which platforms employ the highest number of features that facilitate the trade of temporal flexibility from workers to requesters, consequently increasing workers’ temporal precarity. We conclude the paper by discussing the implications of the results.},

Second, we collected N = 800 user descriptions of virtual indoor locations from N = 80 Amazon Mechanical Turk participants to analyze user language. We explored the effects of conversational agent behavior and observed that people describe indoor locations differently based on how the agent presents itself. We devise “Entity Suitability Scale,” a concrete and scalable approach to obtain information to support localization from the myriad of indoor entities users mention in their descriptions. Through this study, we lay foundation to our proposed paradigm of conversational localization.},

abstract = {The state of loneliness in modern society has been referred to by researchers as an epidemic, the rate of which has been exacerbated by COVID-19. Loneliness can have significantly negative impacts on human wellbeing. In this paper, we propose gratitude interventions as a potential solution to improve prosocial behaviour, social connectedness and to function as a mediator of the negative affect associated with loneliness. We present a multi-modal gratitude intervention journaling app that leverages research in social isolation and gratitude intervention and aims to alleviate some of the consequences of loneliness. ​​},

abstract = {Over time our daily visual tasks become more complex continuously, however, the natural adaptation of our visual system does not adapt as fast as the living environment changes. As the representations of this unbalanced trend, concentration difficulty and visual overload are experienced and studied intensively. As well as universal motion sickness occurs in both real-life and virtual environments. Besides, online learning and co-working experience are far from satisfactory, which is partly due to lacking engagement and instantaneous visual interaction that we used to have when conducting those activities offline. Thus, my goal is to propose methods helping us better adapt to rapidly changing visual contexts. In the formative research, I created dynamic peripheral vision blocking glasses, and its experimental result indicates that wearing such glasses helped its users suffer fewer motion sickness symptoms while accessing fast-moving surrounding scenery in a VR environment. For the following studies, I am creating dynamic saliency adjusting glasses and gaze guiding glasses to augment and reshape daily-life visual perception.},

Unlike AI systems that produce decisions or descriptions, generative AI systems can produce new and creative content that can include images, texts, music, video, and other forms of design. The results are often similar to results produced by humans. However, it is not yet clear how humans make sense of generative AI algorithms or their outcomes. It is also not yet clear how humans can control and more generally, interact with, these powerful capabilities. Finally, it is not clear what kinds of collaboration patterns will emerge when creative humans and creative technologies work together. It is time to convene the interdisciplinary research domain of generative AI and HCI. Participation in this invitational workshop is open to seasoned scholars and early career researchers. We solicit descriptions of completed projects, works-in-progress, and provocations. Together we will develop theories and practices in this intriguing new domain.},

abstract = {As humans increasingly interact (and even collaborate) with AI systems during decision-making, creative exercises, and other tasks, appropriate trust and reliance are necessary to ensure proper usage and adoption of these systems. Specifically, people should understand when to trust or rely on an algorithm’s outputs and when to override them. While significant research focus has aimed to measure and promote trust in human-AI interaction, the field lacks synthesized definitions and understanding of results across contexts. Indeed, conceptualizing trust and reliance, and identifying the best ways to measure these constructs and effectively shape them in human-AI interactions remains a challenge. This workshop aims to establish building appropriate trust and reliance on (imperfect) AI systems as a vital, yet under-explored research problem. The workshop will provide a venue for exploring three broad aspects related to human-AI trust: (1) How do we clarify definitions and frameworks relevant to human-AI trust and reliance (e.g., what does trust mean in different contexts)? (2) How do we measure trust and reliance? And, (3) How do we shape trust and reliance? As these problems and solutions involving humans and AI are interdisciplinary in nature, we invite participants with expertise in HCI, AI, ML, psychology, and social science, or other relevant fields to foster closer communications and collaboration between multiple communities.},

However, its use in HCI has remained superficial and disjointed across various application domains like games, health and wellbeing, or learning. This workshop therefore convenes researchers across HCI to co-create a research agenda on how SDT-informed HCI research can maximise its progress in the coming years.},

abstract = {Housing costs have risen dramatically in the past decade, surpassing their pre-Recession levels, but the data that housing researchers and policymakers rely on to understand these dynamics remain subject to important limitations in their spatiotemporal granularity or methodological transparency. While these aspects of existing public and private data sources present barriers to understanding the geography of cost and availability in markets across the United States, web data about housing opportunities provide an important alternative—albeit one that demands technical skills that would-be data users may lack. This case study documents the experiences of a collaboration between social and computer scientists focused on using a novel programming-by-demonstration tool for web automation, Helena, to inform rental housing policy and inequalities in the United States. While this project was initially focused on collecting housing ads from a single site within the Seattle area, the capacity to scale our project to new sources and locations afforded by Helena’s human-centered design allowed a team of social scientists to progress to scraping data across the country and multiple platforms. Using this project as a case study, we discuss a.) important programming and research challenges that were encountered and b.) how Helena’s design helped us overcome these barriers to using scraped web data in basic research and policy analysis.},

abstract = {Accessibility in a hospital is challenging for people in low-income countries due to a lack of accessible mediums to communicate wayfinding, accessibility, and healthcare information. This results in delays and stress but can also result in sub-optimal treatment or sometimes a complete lack of treatment for the visitors. Sensible physical and digital interventions can greatly ease the experience of visitors and reduce the work-related stress of healthcare providers. We present a case study on wayfinding and service design for a mega ophthalmic care facility that has a daily footfall of 2500 patients. From our mixed-methods study we identified: (i) there are very few accessible mediums available to communicate wayfinding, accessibility, and healthcare information; (ii) there is a lack of inclusively designed interventions to accommodate the diversity of visitors; (iii) spatial ambiguity and situational impairment due to crowd density exasperate the situation and (iv) there exist missing as well as misleading information. We developed a spectrum of solutions on the environmental and digital infrastructures available within this context to deliver wayfinding and procedural information. We completed a progressive intervention across digital and physical mediums over a duration of 18 months. This has shown the impact of each medium on visitors’ experience. We found the choice of interface to access information depends on the ease of access, and ease of access depends on visitors’ abilities. Therefore, both the environment and digital mediums are found to be useful for visitors. Based on these empirical findings, we draw recommendations for an inclusive service design that incorporates using elements of the environment, human and digital infrastructure to support a more positive healthcare visitors experience.},

abstract = {In this case study, we present a mixed methodology approach to needfinding, integrating in-depth qualitative interview data with machine learning-powered analysis of a larger dataset. The research is motivated by the high failure rates and low involvement of consumers in the food startup industry’s product design process. To help food startups design products in a more consumer-friendly and timely manner, we are developing a novel framework called the Food Personality Framework (FPF). This framework categorizes eaters according to their eating habits, preferences, motivations and constraints. To better understand the complex relationships between motivations, we chose Grounded Theory as the most pertinent approach and interviewed 14 singles with full autonomy over their food choices. We further leveraged the availability of large online food-related datasets to inform and reinforce our findings from the qualitative work. We analyzed 6687 user behaviors of Food.com, a popular recipe recommendation site, according to the 18 influencers of food choice identified from the qualitative interviews. We found three meaningful clusters of user behavior: Minimalists, Social Butterflies and Conscious eaters. The interview data, thus, enabled grounded classification of the large scale user behavior and provided a grounded way to interpret the relationship among the top motivators identified in each clusters. The cluster analysis will inform future sampling of interviewees and will provide new insightful questions for the qualitative research. The case study delineates a dynamic interplay of qualitative and quantitative data used to investigate human food choice, a novel domain in the Human-Food Interaction literature.},

By sharing the models again in a 3D format, others can build on work and increase the complexity of what is shared in the community. The resulting more advanced models and the ability to customize them to individual users’ needs, increase the value of models for laser cutting shared online.
