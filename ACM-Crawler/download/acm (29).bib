abstract = {This SIG proposes starting a discussion on the CHI platform about the issues pertinent to the design of digital payments and digitization of financial services. Although there has been a lot of discussion in HCI around domains such as health and education, the domain of financial HCI is still nascent. The purpose of this SIG is to engage researchers and the broader community at CHI in the discussion and debate around digital payments for the next billion users. We propose creating a live working document starting before the SIG which continues to develop during and after the SIG. This live document will enable to engage with a wider audience of researchers, and industry practitioners outlining processes, methods, and tools that HCI4D researchers have created to work with emergent users to develop ICT interventions.},

Beyond CHI, the community has benefited from the CHI PLAY conference series (an ACM SIGCHI sponsored conference) focusing on all areas of games and play in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). CHI 2020 marks the start of a new decade. This provides an opportunity for us to reflect on the advances made in HCI and games in the last decade, and to discuss and plan our focus for the new decade. Therefore, this SIG aims to engage the Games and Play community members in a discussion about the directions that we can take to advance the field forward, highlighting key research and development challenges to help navigate the complexities that we are facing.},

This SIG aims to discuss the use and benefits of these conversational digital assistants for the well being of older adults. The goals for this SIG are to: (i) explore the acceptance/adoption of voice-based conversational agents for older adults. (ii) explore anthropomorphism in the design of conversational digital assistants. (iii) understand triggers (scenarios of use) that can initiate the process of reminiscence thus leading to meaningful conversation. (iv) explore conversational User Experience. (v) explore the co-existence of non-conversational use cases.},

Participants included two teachers and five parents. We found that the diary study method worked well to collect data about app use; however, the design of our study inadvertently introduced problems, especially for the participating parents. Problems included feelings of pressure among our participants for their children to engage with apps that they had little interest in. Collecting data about how children with ASD use commercially available technologies like mobile apps is challenging and requires experimentation of methods; this case study paper will help other researchers who are working with similar user groups in navigating these challenges.},

This one-day workshop will explore how HCI has and might continue to engage uncertainty as a generative feature in design, as opposed to a force to mitigate and control. We hope to convene researchers from broad ranging areas to explore the many ways in which uncertainty appears in our research and the different types of responses that HCI has to offer. There is an incredible variety of conceptual formulations of uncertainty and related ideas like risk, ambiguity, and suspense that raise both difficult challenges as well as significant opportunities for creative engagement with societal challenges. During the workshop, we won't seek to "solve" uncertainty but rather expand the ways in which we think about and navigate it. In doing so, we will experiment with and contribute to new practices, methods, and concepts for embracing uncertainty. Outcomes of the workshop will include documentation of exercises designed to evoke uncertainty in participants, concept mappings, and a collection of short essays written and refined by participants.},

This workshop will address socio-methodological issues at play across design contexts, and build a community comprised of those who seek to support the expression and inclusion of diverse needs, abilities, and experiences in design. Research often involves participants who communicate in ways which are in line with assumed social norms and practices (e.g. those who communicate verbally), while those who communicate differently can be under-represented in design research. We highlight a need to broaden the inclusion and support of communities who have different communication needs, including; people with functional communication impairments, neurodiverse people, people who experience adverse life situations or trauma, people who are discriminated against or under-represented, and many, many other individuals and communities. We aim to unpick - and develop pragmatic solutions to - several challenges around working with diverse communities in research and practice, producing functional guidelines for design research in this area and problematising current methods and terminology.},

abstract = {As AI changes the way decisions are made in organizations and governments, it is ever more important to ensure that these systems work according to values that diverse users and groups find important. Researchers have proposed numerous algorithmic techniques to formalize statistical fairness notions, but emerging work suggests that AI systems must account for the real-world contexts in which they will be embedded in order to actually work fairly. These findings call for an expanded research focus beyond statistical fairness to that which includes fundamental understandings of human use and the social impact of AI systems, a theme central to the HCI community. The HCI community can contribute novel understandings, methods, and techniques for incorporating human values and cultural norms into AI systems; address human biases in developing and using AI; and empower individual users and society to audit and control AI systems. Our goal is to bring together academic and industry researchers in the fields of HCI, ML and AI, and the social sciences to devise a cross-disciplinary research agenda for fair and responsible AI systems. This workshop will build on previous algorithmic fairness workshops at AI and ML conferences, map research and design opportunities for future innovations, and disseminate them in each community.},

Examples include but are not limited to wearables, AR and VR glasses, devices in smart homes, and public displays. The goal of this workshop is to develop a common understanding of challenges and opportunities smart devices and environments create for secure and usable authentication.

abstract = {In an Experience Sampling Method (ESM) based emotion self-report collection study, engaging participants for a long period is challenging due to the repetitiveness of answering self-report probes. This often impacts the self-report collection as participants dropout in between or respond with arbitrary responses. Self-reflection (or commonly known as analyzing past activities to operate more efficiently in the future) has been effectively used to engage participants in logging physical, behavioral, or psychological data for Quantified Self (QS) studies. This motivates us to apply self-reflection to improve the emotion self-report collection procedure. We design, develop, and deploy a self-reflection interface and augment it with a smartphone keyboard-based emotion self-report collection application. The interface provides feedback to the users regarding the relation between typing behavior and self-reported emotions. We validate the proposed approach using a between-subject study, where one group (control group) is not exposed to the self-reflection interface and the other group (study group) is exposed to it. Our initial results demonstrate that using self-reflection it is possible to engage the participants in the long-term and collect more self-reports.},

We conducted a citation analysis of 70 published texts that cited this paper, using the Harwood functions to identify how feminist theory concepts have been cited in HCI and whether the implementation of proposed frameworks has taken place. This paper was mostly given 'credit,' and most frequently 'signposted' to keep readers on track of the topical issues in HCI, with little evidence of explicit use or extension of proposed frameworks. These results demonstrate a largely one-dimensional impact, characterized by a lack of deep engagement in feminist theories.

This late-breaking work presents an ongoing industrial research project aimed at designing, building, and implementing an XAI system for humanitarian aid planning. We draw on empirical data from our project and define current and future scenarios of use, adopting a scenario-based XAI design approach. These scenarios surface three central themes which shape human-AI collaboration in humanitarian aid planning: (1) Surfacing Causality, (2) Multifaceted Trust &amp; Lack of Data Quality, (3) Balancing Risky Situations. We explore each theme and in doing so, further our understanding of how humanitarian aid planners can partner with AI systems to better support forcibly displaced peoples.},

In this work, we design, develop, and evaluate a system to augment the integration of global with local features, alongside Speech-Language Pathologists (SLPs) who work with autistic children having significant speech and language disorders. We present our preliminary experiment with a high-fidelity global filter and hypothesize that the filtered image can shift eye gaze (and therefore visual attention) from local details to global features. Global interpretation will be further encouraged by asking participants "what was the picture about?" We present results and discuss limitations and future work.},

Despite this potential, the effect of transferring physical collaborative experience into a virtual one is unclear. Therefore, we investigated the experience differences between a collaborative virtual environment (CVE) and a physical environment. We used a museum visit as a task since it is a typical social experience and a promising use case for VR. 48 participants experienced the task in real and virtual environments, either alone or with a partner. Despite the potential of CVEs, we found that being in a virtual environment has adverse effects on the experience which is reinforced by being in the environment with another person. Based on quantitative and qualitative results, we provide recommendations for the design of future multi-user virtual environments.},

The Kinetic AR framework facilitates human-robot collaboration in a co-located environment. Our goal is to present a deployable guide for the creation and visualization of manifold robotic interfaces while maintaining a low entry barrier to complex spatial hardware programming. A two phase validation process has been conducted to assess our work. As an initial phase, we have performed a set of interviews with robotics experts. Based on these interviews we have established three main areas that our framework tackles in different time domains. In a second phase, we have developed a set of prototypes using mobile Augmented Reality that apply the principles of Kinetic AR to multiple hardware actors including an AGV, a robotic arm, and a prosthetic system. Additional feedback from experts indicate the potential of the Kinetic ARframework.},

abstract = {Enhancing a user's sense of presence and immersion with haptic technologies has recently been getting increasing attention in virtual reality (VR). Yet while several devices that use wind as a haptic modality have been proposed, it is difficult to precisely and quickly control the stimulation of the wind. In this study, we tackle creating an illusion of wind blowing with multiple air cannons that provides clear and low-latency tactile sensations in a specific area. Although air cannons are limited to providing short one-time stimuli, we propose a method for creating a sense of wind blowing with air cannons based on the perception of apparent tactile motion (ATM). We conducted an experiment with 12 participants to investigate the occurrence of the wind blowing sensation and the optimal parameters for it using three air cannons that were placed to hit three parts on the face. Finally, based on the results, we have exhibited a demonstration of the wind-blowing illusion with three air cannons. It created a sense that virtual objects passed in front of the participants by synchronizing with the sound source movement.},

We leverage four types of geometric patterns: rotational erection system (RES), split-fold waterbomb (SFWB), the overlaid structure of SFWB and RES (SFWB+RES), and cylindrical origami, to render different sets of haptic feedback (i.e., linear, bistable, snap-through, and angular rotational force behaviors, respectively). In each structure, form factor and force feedback properties can be tuned through geometric parameters. Based on the experimental results and analysis, we implemented software to automatically generate 2D patterns for desired haptic properties. We also showcased five example applications: assistive input interfaces, rotational switch, multi-sensory toy, task checklist, and phone accessories. We believe the Kirigami Haptic Swatches helps tinkerers, designers, and even researchers to create interactions that enrich our haptic experience.},

abstract = {We introduce an advanced computer vision-based AI system that offers people with vision impairments (VI) dynamic, in-situ access to information about the location, identity and gaze-direction of other people nearby. Our AI system utilizes the camera technology of a head-worn HoloLens device, which captures a near 180° field-of-view surrounding the person who is wearing it. Captured images are then processed by multiple state-of-the-art perception algorithms whose outputs are integrated into a real-time tracking model of all people that the system detected. Users can receive information about those people acoustically (via spatialized audio) using a wrist-worn input controller. Having such dynamic access to information, through AI system interactions, enables people with VI to: develop their communication skills; more easily focus on others; and be more confident in their social interactions. Thus, our work explores how AI systems can serve as a useful resource for humans, helping expand their agency to develop new or extend existing skills.},

To support rapid fabrication in a sketching-like fashion, we developed a handheld dispenser tool for directly applying continuous functional tapes of desired length as well as discrete patches. We demonstrate versatile compositions techniques that allow to create complex circuits, utilize commodity textile accessories and sketch custom-shaped I/O modules. We further provide a comprehensive library of components for input, output, wiring and computing. Three example applications demonstrate the functionality, versatility and potential of this approach.},

Construction workers are particularly vulnerable to noise-induced hearing loss, so this was the target user for this design.

Previous gesture studies under a user-centered approach have neglected the effects of visual characteristics of interface objects. To validate the effects, we collect users' multiple gesture responses through a gesture elicitation experiment for nine functions on thirteen stimuli systemically manipulated by visual properties. In the analyses, we investigate on 1) user agreements for the function-gesture mappings, and 2) differences in gesture selection in terms of the visual pattern. In the results, users respond differently in gesture selection in terms of the visual pattern-layout and number of images. This result indicates that designers should consider the visual properties of on-screen objects beyond user-elicited gestures. This study contributes toward a method for designing intuitive gestures on the touchscreen.},

abstract = {Computing impacts almost every aspect of modern life. In this current wave of computing, designers strive for ubiquitous use across contexts, across platforms, and across users. Yet, there is still much to be explored in the area of accessible technologies for collaborative work. Assistive technologies are often designed for single use or single users. Interoperability between assistive technologies and computer-supported collaborative systems is essential to co-located work that inherently involves interdependencies between coworkers. The interoperability of collaborative workplace systems with assistive technologies for deaf-blind users is limited to screen readers used with refreshable braille displays [3]. How can a deaf-blind person collaborate with coworkers in real time? In this work, we explore socio-technical challenges of a work environment that depends on collaborative and assistive technologies. We observed an Information Systems and Technology (IS&amp;T) department at a University that is made up of 65 employees-one of whom is a deaf-blind programmer analyst. Through Contextual Inquiry, our observations revealed communication tensions. We present 3 Wizard of Oz prototypes to facilitate communication between the assistive technology user and the other employees in the department. We discuss the socio-technical features weaved through the prototypes. Future work is discussed.},

abstract = {This paper presents findings from an ongoing investigation into the public understanding of augmented reality (AR) technologies. Despite AR technologies becoming increasingly available to the general public, perceptions of its use and capabilities still vary based on a number of factors. To explore this concept, a survey was conducted into individual's definition of AR and classification of AR and traditional technologies. The themes elicited from responses indicated that digital and real components were both perceived as key characteristics, but the synthesis of these components was not significant. Responses also indicated that the public is still relatively unfamiliar with AR technologies, but familiarity does lend itself to a better understanding of what is or isn't AR. Trends in public perceptions of AR are presented, but also identify the need for more investigation into the public understanding of AR technologies.},

abstract = {Mealtimes serve important social functions in our everyday lives. Public dining spaces on college campuses are positioned to be social and engaging spaces to make new connections. With the prevalence of digital devices, technology usage introduces new dynamics into students' mealtimes. In this study, we explored the current mealtime technology usage patterns of college students and rethought the role of technology in eating. We proposed Meal Chat - a technology probe to explore the alternative role of technology during mealtimes by encouraging social interaction for students eating at on-campus public dining areas. Meal Chat aims to provide an opportunity for college students to socialize and reduce the barrier of starting mealtime socialization with a stranger. Rethinking the role of technology in mealtimes, Meal Chat seeks to prompt rather than to replace social interaction during mealtimes.},

A recent study explored the potential of training staff at a university to recognize phishing attacks through either facts or utilizing stories shared by peers or experts. The study found that facts from an expert, rather than stories from experts or peers, remain the most effective form of training. Here we replicate and extend this study by targeting current college students. The results show that college students respond differently than university staff and are more receptive to social stories or facts from peers. These results indicate the importance of taking the target demographic into account when designing and conducting phishing training.},

After piloting the tool in two online courses for seven months, we interviewed learners from these courses.We found that learners most often used the Gallery Tool to "check all the boxes" of the course or to find inspiration for their own assignments. They liked its aesthetic and ease of use, but low levels of feedback activity decreased its value to them. As a result, it typically had a neutral impact on their course experience.Our findings are most relevant to other educational technology practitioners, as they reveal insights for balancing and improving learner experience and user experience in web applications for massive open online courses.},

abstract = {While much research has been done on games as engaging strategies for assessment and education, little has been done to address the specific human computer interaction questions relating to the impact of player engagement in game experiences. This case study examines a section (284 adults) of a larger study on play preference of over 700 participants who were given four versions of an assessment game. While the content remained the same, the versions varied by their structure (rewarding players for acting either appropriately or inappropriately) and by play perspective aesthetics (direct or indirect character embodiment). The results indicate that player preference was for the aesthetics of indirect embodiment and the goals of negative behavior. While this is perhaps unsurprising to makers of commercial games, this is contrary to typical education assessment game design. The case study also demonstrates a difference in player character embodiment that should prove useful to those determining the perspective of their player environments.},

For this, 25 users assessed two types of avatar animations, one upper baseline generated utilizing motion capture data, and a reference with absolute total positional differences in the mm range generated utilizing machine learned synthetic data. As expected, user evaluation of the synthesized references showed a considerable loss in rating scores. We therefore computed a variety of signal-specific differences between both data types and investigated their correlations to the collected user ratings. Results reveal general statistically significant inter-dependencies of avatar movement and perception helpful for the generation of any type of virtual avatar in the future. However, results also suggest that it is difficult to determine concrete avatar features with a high influence on the user perception in the current study design.},

abstract = {Through technological advancements more and more companies consider virtual reality (VR) for training of their workforce, in particular for situations that occur rarely, are dangerous, expensive, or very difficult to recreate in the real world. This creates the need for understanding the potentials and limitations of VR training and establish best practices. In pursuit of this, we have developed a VR Training simulation for a use case at Grundfos, in which apprentices learn a sequential maintenance task. We evaluated this simulation in a user study with 36 participants, comparing it to two traditional forms of training (Pairwise Training and Video Training). This case study describes the developed virtual training scenario and discusses design considerations for such VR simulations. The results of our evaluation support that, while VR Training is effective in teaching the procedure for a maintenance task, traditional approaches with hands-on experience still lead to a significantly better outcome.},
