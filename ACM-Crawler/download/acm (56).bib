abstract = {Video games are often about being able to do things that are not possible in real life, about experiencing great adventures and visiting new places. Yet, as prolific as gaming is, it is inaccessible to a significant number of people with neuromuscular diseases who are unable to play games with traditional input methods like game controllers or keyboard and mouse combinations. While primarily used for entertainment in the early days, gaming now provides the possibility of countering social isolation and connecting with others through multiplayer games, online gaming communities and game streaming. In our work, we explore how facial expression recognition can be harnessed to provide quadriplegic individuals a way to play games independently and without complex mouth controller devices. We demonstrate our input interface with the design of a first person shooter game.},

abstract = {While ostensibly meritocratic, our society functions on an imperceptible yet undeniable paradigm of privilege. Privilege is an unearned, unasked for advantage gained because of the way society views an aspect of an individual's identity, such as race, caste, ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic status, and language. Privilege permeates nearly every facet of human existence and yet we seem to barely recognise its role in what are seemingly impartial outcomes. Tread Together is an interactive narrative based game that uses gameplay as a tool to help people better reflect on their own privilege and examine how it affects the people around them using a combination of critical and reflective design. The narrative transports players to embark on a journey through an alternative perspective in the game with the express intent of introspective contemplation and scrutiny of privilege as a dominant paradigm in society.},

abstract = {Women with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) face serious physiological and psychosocial challenges. The management of this chronic, incurable condition requires long-term care coordination. Traditional clinical methods do not often provide adequate and personalized support for these individuals. In this project, we aim to use smart speakers to provide supportive care interventions to improve the quality of life for women with MBC. Specifically, we have developed Nurse AMIE (Addressing Metastatic Individuals Everyday) by leveraging the Amazon Alexa to remotely deliver validated interventions. We believe that voice interactions can significantly lower the barrier to interact with remote intervention technologies for this population. In a pilot study, we deployed Nurse AMIE for 14 days over 6 women with MBC. Based on the collected data, this paper discusses the feasibility, acceptability, and future directions of Nurse AMIE. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to use smart speakers to support women with MBC.},

We present a system for using Twitter that requires users to continuously turn a hand crank to power their social media screen. We evaluate the device and its effects on how users value Twitter with 3 participants over 3 weeks, with the middle week of Twitter usage directed exclusively through our system. Using our device caused a dramatic decrease in Twitter usage for all participants, which either persisted or rebounded in the post-intervention week. Our analysis of diary studies and qualitative interviews surfaced three themes indicating shifting focus on content, shifting awareness about the role of social media, and new social dynamics around content-sharing.},

abstract = {Social media platforms face rampant misinformation spread through multimedia posts shared in highly-personalized contexts [10, 11]. Foundational qualitative research is necessary to ensure platforms’ misinformation interventions are aligned with users’ needs and understanding of information in their own contexts, across platforms. In two studies, we combined in-depth interviews (n=15) with diary and co-design methods (n=23) to investigate how a mix of Americans exposed to misinformation during COVID-19 understand their information environments, including encounters with interventions such as Facebook fact-checking labels. Analysis reveals a deep division in user attitudes about platform labeling interventions, perceived by 7/15 interview participants as biased and punitive. As a result, we argue for the need to better research the unintended consequences of labeling interventions on factual beliefs and attitudes. Alongside these findings, we discuss our methods as a model for continued independent qualitative research on cross-platform user experiences of misinformation in order to inform interventions.},

To understand what privacy information ad networks give developers, we did a walkthrough of four popular ad network guidance pages with a senior Android developer by looking at the privacy-related information presented to developers. We found that information is focused on complying with legal regulations, and puts the responsibility for such decisions on the developer. Also, sample code and settings often have privacy-unfriendly defaults laced with dark patterns to nudge developers’ decisions towards privacy-unfriendly options such as sharing sensitive data to increase revenue. We conclude by discussing future research around empowering developers and minimising the negative impacts of dark patterns.},

Although a handful of works exist for improving user awareness and self-efficacy, none of them educate the users about Android Permissions in a contextual manner. In this paper, we discuss our persuasive game -&nbsp;"PermaRun",&nbsp;which teaches and motivates users to follow secure smartphone behaviour, increases user awareness and self-efficacy about android permissions.

abstract = {In the last years, researchers and therapists have pinpointed a number of critical aspects in current speech-language interventions. Several studies have explored the use of technology to overcome these barriers and to support speech-therapy in children with language impairments (e.g. DLD and ASD). In this paper, we propose a conceptual framework for designing linguistic activities (for assessment and training), based on advances in psycholinguistics. Moving from this theoretical framework, we identified a development process - from the UX design to coding of activities – which is based on a novel set of Design Patterns at multiple layers of abstraction. We then put this framework into practice by implementing these patterns into two technological solutions – tablet and robots – and performing an empirical study to evaluate their benefits. Our results, although still preliminary since they assessed only a tablet experimental condition, are promising for extending the identified Design Patterns to other technological solutions.},

Yet, people often find it difficult to initiate and maintain conversation due to the lack of information about strangers. Hence, we aimed to facilitate conversation between the strangers with the use of machine learning (ML) algorithms and present BlahBlahBot, an ML-infused chatbot that moderates conversation between strangers with personalized topics. Based on social media posts, BlahBlahBot supports the conversation by suggesting topics that are likely to be of mutual interest between users. A user study with three groups (control, random topic chatbot, and BlahBlahBot; N=18) found the feasibility of BlahBlahBot in increasing both conversation quality and closeness to the partner, along with the factors that led to such increases from the user interview. Overall, our preliminary results imply that an ML-infused conversational agent can be effective for augmenting a dyadic conversation.},

We suggest that the function of few-shot examples in these cases is better described as locating an already learned task rather than meta-learning. This analysis motivates rethinking the role of prompts in controlling and evaluating powerful language models. We discuss methods of prompt programming, emphasizing the usefulness of considering prompts through the lens of natural language. We explore techniques for exploiting the capacity of narratives and cultural anchors to encode nuanced intentions and techniques for encouraging deconstruction of a problem into components before producing a verdict. Informed by this more encompassing theory of prompt programming, we also introduce the idea of a metaprompt that seeds the model to generate its own natural language prompts for a range of tasks. Finally, we discuss how these more general methods of interacting with language models can be incorporated into existing and future benchmarks and practical applications.},

abstract = {Responsible conduct of research (RCR) is an essential skill for all researchers to develop, but training scientists to behave ethically is complex because it requires addressing both cognitive (i.e., conceptual knowledge and moral reasoning skills) and socio-affective (i.e., attitudes) learning outcomes. Currently, both classroom- and web-based forms of RCR training struggle to address these distinct types of learning outcomes simultaneously. In this paper, we present a study providing initial evidence that playing a single brief session of &nbsp;Academical, a choice-based interactive narrative game, can significantly improve players’ attitudes about RCR. We further demonstrate the relationship between engagement with the game and resulting attitudes. Combined with our previous work showing &nbsp;Academical’s advantages over traditional RCR training for teaching cognitive learning outcomes, this study’s results highlight that utilizing a choice-based interactive story game is a uniquely effective way to holistically address RCR learning outcomes that drive ethical research behavior.},

abstract = {The effect of removing gamification elements from interactive systems has been a long-standing question in gamification research. Early work and foundational theories raised concerns about the endurance of positive effects and the emergence of negative ones. Yet, nearly a decade later, no work to date has sought consensus on these matters. Here, I offer a rapid review on the state of the art and what is known about the impact of removing gamification. A small corpus of 8 papers published between 2012 and 2020 were found. Findings suggest a mix of positive and negative effects related to removing gamification. Significantly, insufficient reporting, methodological weaknesses, limited measures, and superficial interpretations of “negative” results prevent firm conclusions. I offer a research agenda towards better understanding the nature of gamification removal. I end with a call for empirical and theoretical work on illuminating the effects that may linger after systems are un-gamified.},

abstract = {Although we extensively use routing services in our daily commutes, such systems are yet to be personalized around the user. It often happens that different routes are close in their estimated time of arrival (ETA) while being very different in how they affect the driver’s states. Using traces of a user’s physiological measures, different candidate routes can be ranked based on how they affect users’ well-being. In this research, we introduce the “empathetic routing” framework for providing human-centered routing based on historical biomarkers of the drivers collected through naturalistic settings and by using smart wearable devices. Through this framework, we rank three specific routes between two points in the city of Charlottesville, based on historical driver heart rate data collected through a three-month naturalistic driving study. Additionally, we demonstrate that the proposed framework is capable of finding infrastructural elements in a route that can potentially affect a driver’s well-being.},

While visual or tactile representations can be used to experience music in a live event or from a recording, DRM anti-piracy encryption restricts access to audio data needed to create these multimodal experiences for music streaming. We introduce BufferBeats, a toolkit for building multimodal music streaming experiences. To explore the flexibility of the toolkit and to exhibit its potential use cases, we introduce and reflect upon building a collection of technical demonstrations that bring previous and new multimodal music experiences to streaming. Grounding our work in critical theories on design, making, and disability, as well as experiences from a small group of community partners, we argue that support for multimodal music streaming experiences will not only be more inclusive to the deaf and hard of hearing, but it will also empower researchers and hobbyist makers to use streaming as a platform to build creative new representations of music.},

This paper proposes a more direct computational food integration by conceptualizing the notion of “Cyber Food”, accentuating “food as computational artifact”, where food embodies digital computation that can be ultimately consumed and digested by the human body. With this work, we attempt to open a new pathway to enrich human-food interactions beyond the traditional boundaries between the physical (edible) and digital realms.},

In this work, we evaluate the use of a co-presenter agent in the delivery of virtual presentations given over a videoconferencing system, comparing them to presentations given without the agent. We found that participants were satisfied with the co-presenter agent, and those who liked the agent (scoring above the mean on a composite self-report measure of satisfaction) rated the presentations they gave with the agent as having significantly higher quality compared to those given without the agent. There was evidence the agent helped participants feel less nervous about their talks. Interviews confirmed these findings, and identified additional advantages and disadvantages of using co-presenter agents in virtual presentations.},

With the popularity of social networking sites (SNS) steadily increasing, psychological and social sciences have shown great interest in their effects and consequences on humans. In this work, we investigate Facebook using the tools of HCI to find connections between interface features and the concerns raised by these domains. Using an empirical design analysis, we identify interface interferences impacting users’ online privacy. Through a subsequent survey (n = 116), we find usage behaviour changes due to increased privacy concerns and report individual cases of addiction and mental health issues. These observations are the results of a rapidly changing SNS creating a gap of understanding between users’ interactions with the platform and future consequences. We explore how HCI can help close this gap and work towards more ethical user interfaces in the future.},

To develop this skill, the use of agility ladders is a widespread and well-known training method. While drills vary, having a human expert explaining and monitoring the exercises is usually advantageous. So far, only a few approaches to interactive systems for agility ladder training have been presented. In this work, we propose an interactive projection system to support an athlete in performing those drills. To investigate the effects of the location of those projections, we conducted an initial study with twelve participants using qualitative and quantitative methods. We found that while projecting instructions and feedback on the floor was favored, participants who were presented the same information in front of them on a projected screen partially performed better in a subsequent agility assessment.},

To prevent an overload of medical capacities, quickly identifying potentially infected persons is vital to stop the spread of the virus. Mobile apps for tracing people’s contacts seem effective, but raise public concerns, e.&nbsp;g., about privacy. Hence, they are contested in public discourse. We report a large-scale NLP-supported analysis of people’s comments about the German contact-tracing app on news websites, social media and app stores. We identified prevalent topics, stances, and how commenting developed over time. We found privacy to be among the most debated topics discussed from various perspectives. Commenting peaked at one point in time, when public discourse centered on the potential tracing protocols and their privacy protection. We encourage further research on the link between the public discussions and actual adoption rates of the app.},

In a 5-day study, 35 participants used their smartphones to make short voice recordings of what they were doing throughout the day. Using these recordings, our model can predict the participants’ well-being scores with a mean absolute error of 14%, relative to the self-reported well-being (“ground truth”). Both audio and text features from the recordings, especially, MFCC and semantic features, are important for prediction accuracy. Based on the work, we provide suggestions for future research to further improve the prediction result.},

abstract = {The use of multi-rotor drones has grown exponentially as a consumer product and in the commercial sector. The inescapable reality is that drones will become a ubiquitous part of society. One major obstacle to the mainstream acceptance of drones is the public perception of drones being dangerous or a safety hazard. This paper presents an investigation into the human factors toward potential drone collisions. The study included twenty participants who underwent a controlled drone collision exposure and a post-exposure interview. We propose a novel drone collision exposure involving a novel experimental setup simulating drone to human collisions safely. We found that all participants identified the drone’s propellers as their primary concern, with the propeller’s sound being the most threatening. Based on the participant feedback, we identified some concerns on a drone’s unregulated aspects and outline common participant recommendations on drone regulations.},

In this study, we aimed to investigate the player’s bereavement process while playing the commercial death-themed game Spiritfarer. Through a thematic analysis of qualitative in-depth interviews with 6 participants, we found that the player’s grieving experience closely resembled the Dual Process Model of Coping with Bereavement by Stroebe and Schut. In the game, players oscillated between facing loss-orientation stressors (‘Character resemblance to the deceased’, ‘Sending characters away’) and restoration-orientation stressors (‘Taking care of remaining spirits’). Through this process, the participants coped with and sometimes reappraised their loss. We further found that the players bereavement experience and level of engagement greatly varied depending on their ‘prior loss experience’, ‘gaming environment’ and ‘tendency to focus on self or game’. Those differences were partly accommodated by the game through its complex and diverse characters and engaging game elements. We conclude with insights for future works in game design for bereavement support.},

Unlike many internet scale systems that use a singular set of search terms and return a ranked list of options from amongst thousands, our system uses multi-turn user dialog to deeply understand the user’s preferences. The system responds in context to the user’s specific and immediate feedback to make sequential recommendations. We envision our system would be highly useful in situations with intrinsic constraints, such as finding the right restaurant within walking distance or the right retail item within a limited inventory. Our research prototype instantiates the former use case, leveraging real data from Google Places, Yelp, and Zomato. We evaluated our system against a similar system that did not incorporate user feedback in a 16 person remote study, generating 64 scenario-based search journeys. When our recommendation system was successfully triggered, we saw both an increase in efficiency and a higher confidence rating with respect to final user choice. We also found that users preferred our system (75%) compared with the baseline.},

abstract = {Intersectional bias is a bias caused by an overlap of multiple social factors like gender, sexuality, race, disability, religion, etc. A recent study has shown that word embedding models can be laden with biases against intersectional groups like African American females, etc. The first step towards tackling intersectional biases is to identify them. However, discovering biases against different intersectional groups remains a challenging task. In this work, we present WordBias, an interactive visual tool designed to explore biases against intersectional groups encoded in static word embeddings. Given a pretrained static word embedding, WordBias computes the association of each word along different groups like race, age, etc. and then visualizes them using a novel interactive interface. Using a case study, we demonstrate how WordBias can help uncover biases against intersectional groups like Black Muslim Males, Poor Females, etc. encoded in word embedding. In addition, we also evaluate our tool using qualitative feedback from expert interviews. The source code for this tool can be publicly accessed for reproducibility at github.com/bhavyaghai/WordBias.},

However, healthy older adults commonly reject robots designed to be an ”artificial friend”. We follow the approach of ”companionship as a secondary function”, in which a non-humanoid robot is designed with a primary function that older adults perceive as appropriate, and a secondary function of companionship. In a Zoom-based exploratory need-study we unfold how older adults perceive the various aspects of a robot’s ”companionship” as a secondary function. Our qualitative analysis reveals several use cases that older adults find to be appropriate for their daily routine, and classify them into three high-level categories: companionship as ”attentive to me”, companionship as ”looking after me”, and companionship as ”experiencing together with me”. Our findings indicate that robot companionship, when designed as a secondary function, is perceived by older adults as a multifaceted social experience.},

EMS is a promising technique for force feedback because of its small form factor when compared to mechanical actuators. However, the current EMS approach to flexing the user's fingers (i.e., attaching electrodes to the base of the forearm, where finger muscles anchor) cannot flex one finger alone at the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint, they always induce unwanted actuation to adjacent fingers. To tackle the lack of dexterity, we propose a new electrode layout that places the electrodes on the back of the hand, where they stimulate the interossei/lumbricals muscles in the palm, which have never received attention with regards to EMS.

abstract = {In smart office buildings, almost every aspect of the environment can be assessed and adjusted by sensors. Yet employees rarely have access to the data collected to act upon it. It is also unclear what they would find meaningful to follow the recommendations on healthy work conditions and behavior, while productivity is the priority. The Office Agents are a set of artefacts placed on the employee's desk, which capture data about the office environment. Air quality, sound level, light exposure, productivity, and physical activity level are measured to provide office workers with feedback on the ‘best’ working conditions. Using speculative design and Objects with Intent, the employee engages in a negotiation with the Office Agents based on the office ecosystem. Through this project and interactivity session, we open a debate on the use of sensors in office environments and the stakes around office vitality from the viewpoint of the employees.},

abstract = {We demonstrate a new type of haptic actuator, which we call MagnetIO, that is comprised of two parts: one battery-powered voice-coil worn on the user's fingernail and any number of interactive soft patches that can be attached onto any surface (everyday objects, user's body, appliances, etc.). When the user's finger wearing our voice-coil contacts any of the interactive patches it detects its magnetic signature via magnetometer and vibrates the patch, adding haptic feedback to otherwise input-only interactions. To allow these passive patches to vibrate, we make them from silicone with regions doped with polarized neodymium powder, resulting in soft and stretchable magnets. This stretchable form-factor allows them to be wrapped to the user's body or everyday objects of various shapes. We demonstrate how these add haptic output to many situations, such as adding haptic buttons to the walls of one's home.},

However, with this growth comes the paralleled increased risk of email harassment, exacerbated by the current lack of platform support for managing these harmful messages. This paper explores different interfaces for the automated detection and management of email harassment using artificial intelligence in order to investigate what degree of platform intervention email users prefer when navigating their email platform. Through conducting a study involving three different email platform prototypes based on the Gmail platform, we evaluate how varying levels of platform intervention affect users’ perceived sense of safety, agency, and trust with their email platform. Our primary findings suggest that users generally benefited from each of the system intervention strategies and desired higher intervention features when combating email harassment, as well as ways of managing this intervention based on their unique preferences.},

abstract = {How working statically-typed functional programmers author code is largely understudied. And yet, a better understanding of developer practices could pave the way for the design of more useful and usable tooling, more ergonomic languages, and more effective on-ramps into programming communities. The goal of this work is to address this knowledge gap: to better understand the high-level authoring patterns that statically-typed functional programmers engage in. I did a grounded theory analysis of thirteen programming sessions of practicing functional programmers, eight of which also included a semi-structured interview. The theory I developed gives insight into how the specific affordances of statically-typed functional programming affect domain modeling, type construction, focusing techniques, exploratory strategies, mental models, and expressions of intent. The success of this approach in revealing program authorship patterns suggests that the same methodology could be used to study other understudied programmer audiences.},

In this study, we built “BunCho”, an AI supported story co-creation system in Japanese. BunCho’s AI is GPT-2 (an unsupervised multitask language model) trained using a large-scale dataset of Japanese web texts and novels. With BunCho, users can generate titles and synopses from keywords. Furthermore, we propose an interactive story co-creation AI system as a tabletop role-playing game. According to summative studies of writers (N=16) and readers (N=32), 69% writers enjoyed writing synopses with BunCho more than by themselves, and at least one of five common metrics were improved at objective evaluation, including creativity. In addition, 63% writers indicated that BunCho broadened their stories. BunCho showed paths to assist Japanese novelists in creating high-level and creative writing.},

Traditionally, self-tracking wearables report&nbsp;basic health data such as resting heart rate; these data are visualised and positive behaviours (e.g. exercising often) are encouraged with rudimentary gamification (e.g. award badges) and notification systems.&nbsp;CoCo is the first wearable to combine caffeine, alcohol and cortisol sensors, a context network (which predicts user context), and a wellness model (which establishes per-user wellness measures). Working in tandem these provide users with notifications that encourage discrete behaviours intended to optimise user-wellness per very specific biological and social contexts. The paper describes the (sometimes unexpected) results of a user-study intended to evaluate CoCo's efficacy and we conclude with a discussion about the power and responsibility that comes with attempts to build context-aware computing systems.},
