abstract = {Pet owners form strong emotional bonding with their pet dogs, but sometimes they have to be separated from their pet dogs due to varying reasons resulting in negative feelings such as distress or anxiety. Researchers and designers in HCI have explored a variety of approaches to resolve this issue, including designing pet camera, pet chat system, as well as devices for playful remote interaction and haptic simulation. Informed by prior work on facilitating intimacy between distant couples and family members, we present the design and implementation of cAMpanion to promote distant owner's sense of connectedness to their pet dogs when separating from each other. cAMpanion displays three statuses of pet dogs via different light colors in real-time enabled by sensor modules installed in pet dog's living environment. We share lessons learned from a pilot study examining potential issues during sensor deployment as well as participants’ feedback toward cAMpanion.},

abstract = {Today’s level of cyclists’ road safety is primarily estimated using accident reports and self-reported measures. However, the former is focused on post-accident situations and the latter relies on subjective input. In our work, we aim to extend the landscape of cyclists’ safety assessment methods via a two-dimensional taxonomy, which covers data source (internal/external) and type of measurement (objective/subjective). Based on this taxonomy, we classify existing methods and present a mobile sensing concept for quantified cycling safety that fills the identified methodological gap by collecting data about body movements and physiological data. Finally, we outline a list of use cases and future research directions within the scope of the proposed taxonomy and sensing concept.},

In this paper, we showcase a system called VRtangibles, which combines tangible objects and touch input to create virtual scenes without programming. With VRtangibles, we aim to engage children in the active creation of virtual scenes via playful hands-on activities. From the lab study with six school children, we discovered that the majority of children were successful in creating virtual scenes using VRtangibles and found it engaging and fun to use.},

abstract = {The unprecedented pandemic of the infectious coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is still ongoing. Considering the limitations and restrictions imposed by COVID-19, we explored the role of technology and the extent of usage by end-users. In our online survey, we investigated users’ perspectives on their use of technologies in different contexts (e.g., work, entertainment), taking into consideration intrinsic factors such as health consciousness, perceived social isolation, and pandemic-related concerns. Results from 218 respondents show a significant increase in technology use in all investigated contexts after the pandemic occurred. Moreover, the results suggest that different factors may contribute to such increases, depending on the context. It appears that perceived social isolation, concerns about the pandemic, and tracking have the most prominent influence on different use of technology. Furthermore, open-ended responses include beneficial opportunities, concerns &amp; consequences, and behavioral transformations &amp; adaptations due to COVID-19. Our findings provide insights for designing and developing new technologies, especially for communication and entertainment, to support users’ needs during a pandemic.},

abstract = {Sharing humor within a team can have various benefits. In multilingual teams, however, it is often challenging for nonnative-speaking members (NNS) of the team to fully understand the humor shared among native speakers (NS). In an interview study with 28 NNS, we identified common sources of confusion in humorous interactions. Our study also revealed that the (mis)alignment of people's assumptions of others’ knowledge is key to failed humor and its consequences. NNS felt that NS often assumed everyone shared the knowledge required to understand their humor; thus, cultural references unfamiliar to NNS were a dominant source of confusion. On the other hand, NNS often felt ignorant for not knowing the references required to understand NS humor, as they assumed all the references unfamiliar to them must be generic knowledge known by all NS. We propose design ideas for better alignment of common ground assumptions between NS and NNS to facilitate humor-related communication and alleviate possible negative consequence of failed humor.},

In this paper, we discuss volunteering as a form of work and how certain experiential aspects of HCI systems supporting the volunteers’ unpaid labour are instrumental in volunteer wellbeing. The sense of feeling close to others and experiencing relatedness is an important factor that can predict engagement and wellbeing of volunteers. Relatedness can be achieved in many ways, for instance, through expressing and receiving gratitude. Through four co-design workshops with n=9 participants, we identified seven perceptions of volunteers regarding their relatedness experiences. This was achieved via a case study of an online teleconferencing platform where volunteers help train and assess medical students for their medical communication skills. Findings are further discussed to inform future design to support adequate level of formalness and emotional labour in online volunteering communities.},

Understanding how these platforms flourish is thus of interest to both HCI academia and the broader UX discipline. In this study, we comparatively investigate the longevity of two such groups: the r/userexperience community on Reddit and the UX subforum on Stack Exchange. By quantifying how users post online on aggregate and what users discuss in their individual posts, we find that Reddit has grown consistently as a digital forum for UX practice. In contrast, Stack Exchange has contracted despite being more responsive and being as capable of addressing mainstream UX concepts as Reddit. Discussions of niche, higher-level UX concepts on Stack Exchange also declined disproportionately, leading to less conceptual diversity. Our results therefore contribute an initial comparative understanding of community longevity between online UX platforms.},

To achieve proactivity, however, requires the speaker to become context-aware and be able to detect opportune moments to initiate interactions. In this work, we present a proactive speaker prototype based on Google Home to investigate interaction contexts. We, additionally, built a voice-based Experience Sampling Method (ESM) application to study contextual factors that are correlated to opportune moments for device-triggered interactions. Preliminary results from a three-week field study with 7 participants indicate the proposed prototype is a robust way to achieve proactivity and implement voice-based ESM.

The system scans the vitiligo area with the Light Detection and Ranging scanner to generate the 3D skin surface model and obtain the white patches image. Users can design their own tattoos or choose recommended designs that are available in the gallery to match up the pattern and the white patches’ shape through the application that is linked to the system. We evaluate our system through a light usability test and semi-structured interview. The results show that ColorGuardian has positive impacts on children by reducing their feelings of inferiority.},

We examine the use of Twitter by EWs as a step toward understanding the pandemic’s impact on their mental well-being, as compared to the population as a whole. We found that EWs authored a higher ratio of mental health related tweets during the pandemic than the average user, but authored fewer tweets with Covid related keywords than average users. Despite this, sentiment analysis showed that, on average, EWs’ tweets yield a more positive sentiment score than average Twitter users, both before and during the pandemic. Based on these initial insights, we highlight our future aims to investigate individual differences in this impact to EWs.},

abstract = {Sleep plays an integral role in human health and is vitally important for neurological development in infants. In this study, we propose the PneuMat, an interactive shape-changing system integrating sensors and pneumatic drives, to help ensure sleep safety through novel human-computer interaction. This system comprises sensor units, control units and inflatable units. The sensor units utilize information exchange between infants and the system, and detect the infant's sleeping posture, sending raw data to control units. For better sleep experience, the inflatable units are divided into nine areas. The inflatable units are multi-mode, can be independently inflated in different areas, and can be inflated in different areas together. We aim to ensure sleep safety by ensuring that infants stay in a safe sleeping position while in bed, by autonomously actuating the PneuMat's shape-changing capability. In this article, we describe the division of PneuMat, the design of the control unit, integration of the sensors and our preliminary experiments to evaluate the feasibility of our interaction system. Finally, based on the results, we will discuss future work involving the PneuMat.},

abstract = {The behavior of self-driving cars may differ from people’s expectations (e.g. an autopilot may unexpectedly relinquish control). This expectation mismatch can cause potential and existing users to distrust self-driving technology and can increase the likelihood of accidents. We propose a simple but effective framework, AutoPreview, to enable consumers to preview a target autopilot’s potential actions in the real-world driving context before deployment. For a given target autopilot, we design a delegate policy that replicates the target autopilot behavior with explainable action representations, which can then be queried online for comparison and to build an accurate mental model. To demonstrate its practicality, we present a prototype of AutoPreview integrated with the CARLA simulator along with two potential use cases of the framework. We conduct a pilot study to investigate whether or not AutoPreview provides deeper understanding about autopilot behavior when experiencing a new autopilot policy for the first time. Our results suggest that the AutoPreview method helps users understand autopilot behavior in terms of driving style comprehension, deployment preference, and exact action timing prediction.},

To create an end-to-end system, a parametric design tool with an optimal Euler path calculation method is developed, which can support both inverse and forward design workflow and multi-material construction of modular parts. In addition, the workflow guides the assembly of printed truss modules by threading. Finally, a series of application cases to demonstrate the affordance of FlexTruss are presented. We believe that FlexTruss extends the design space of 3D printing beyond typically hard and fixed forms, and it will provide new capabilities for designers and researchers to explore the use of such flexible truss structures in human-object interaction.},

abstract = {Gaze in the context of interactive systems plays a vital role in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). Gaze-aware systems provide support for users with physical disabilities, are employed as a game input device, or serve as an input form in public settings. The installation introduced in this work, called “Blind Spot”, reflects these developments by using gaze in an art context by partially obscuring the user’s field of view (i.e., the current gaze position). In doing so, the installation illustrates the potentials and characteristics of eye-tracking technology. It aims at fostering discussions about new design possibilities for gaze-based interactions in the arts and academia. Furthermore, it makes spectators aware of how visual information is processed by humans (i.e., only a small fraction with high visual acuity is perceived at a given moment). Thirdly, it addresses the human’s desire to retrieve a complete picture of a given scenery (i.e., revealing this desire by limiting the spectator’s perception capabilities).},

However, it has remained unknown how different VR technology would influence pedestrian behaviour. This paper presents VR experiments that were conducted with 70 participants using a desktop VR or a HMD VR to perform four different wayfinding tasks in a multi-story building. Quantitative analysis of pedestrian behaviour data and user experience data were performed in order to investigate the impact of the technological differences between the two VR techniques. It was found that participants had better wayfinding task performance in the desktop group. However, the route and exit choice and user experience were overall similar between the two groups. The findings suggest that one could adopt more ‘simple’ VR technologies for studies featuring ‘simple’ wayfinding tasks.},

The goal of this special interest group is to provide a forum for researchers and practitioners to discuss and advance the theoretical underpinnings of designed friction, the relation of friction to other design paradigms, and to identify the domains and interaction flows that frictions might best suit.

abstract = {Human-Computer Integration (HInt) is a growing paradigm within HCI which seeks to understand how humans can, and already are, merging with computational machines. HInt’s recent inception and evolution has seen much discussion in a variety of symposiums, workshops, and publications for HCI. This has enabled a democratized and decentralised emergence of its core concepts. While this has allowed for rapid growth in our understanding of HInt, there is some discrepancy in how the proponents of this movement might describe its principles, motivations, definitions, and ultimate goals, with many offshoot concepts of HInt beginning to emerge. SIGHint aims to provide a platform to facilitate high level discussion and collation of information between researchers and designers seeking to learn from and contribute to the development of Human-Computer Integration. It is our intention that through this SIG we may better understand how new and emerging, diverging ideas, and perspectives within Human-Computer Integration relate to each other, ultimately facilitating a mapping of the paradigm and a synthesis of its concepts.},

Key to managing this is not only identifying, countering and debunking misinformation but also providing unbiased and factually correct information and signposting people towards it. However, during COVID19, the ‘truth’ has not always been clear. It has not always been easy to prepare public health messaging that is consistent, easily understood or practical for everyone to apply. This presents unique challenges, to which social media platforms need to be part of the solution. One such solution can be found on www.reddit.com where, in January 2020, a group of research scientists, students, academics and medics came together to create and moderate forums in which the pandemic can be discussed and questions about it answered. These forums provide case studies of how information can be generated, misinformation corrected and disinformation debunked on subreddits with, combined, more than 3 million subscribers.},

Based on face video, questionnaire, and interview data we constructed their profiles. We added a dose of fictionalization to these profiles, composing anonymized comic stories that are as humorous as they are enlightening. In the stressful and lonely days towards deadlines, the only common presence in all cases is the researchers’ computer. Accordingly, this work aspires to prompt an effort for a deeper understanding of “deadline users’’, in support of designing much needed affective interfaces.},

abstract = {Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) create new opportunities for implementing a wide range of intelligent user interfaces. Speech-based interfaces, chatbots, visual recognition of users and objects, recommender systems, and adaptive user interfaces are examples that have majored over the last 10 years due to new approaches in machine learning (ML). Modern ML-techniques outperform in many domains of previous approaches and enable new applications. Today, it is possible to run models efficiently on various devices, including PCs, smartphones, and embedded systems. Leveraging the potential of artificial intelligence and combining them with human-computer interaction approaches allows developing intelligent user interfaces supporting users better than ever before. This course introduces participants to terms and concepts relevant in AI and ML. Using examples and application scenarios, we practically show how intelligent user interfaces can be designed and implemented. In particular, we look at how to create optimized keyboards, use natural language processing for text and speech-based interaction, and how to implement a recommender system for movies. Thus, this course aims to introduce participants to a set of machine learning tools that will enable them to build their own intelligent user interfaces. This course will include video based lectures to introduce concepts and algorithms supported by practical and interactive exercises using python notebooks.},

abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) routinely achieve state-of-the-art performance in a wide range of tasks, but it can often be challenging for them to meet end-user needs in practice. This case study reports on the development of human-AI onboarding materials (i.e., training materials for users prior to using an AI) for a DNN-based medical AI Assistant to aid in the grading of prostate cancer. Specifically, we describe how the process of developing these materials changed the team’s understanding of end-user requirements, contributing to modifications in the development and assessment of the underlying machine learning model. Importantly, we discovered that onboarding materials served as a useful boundary object for cross-functional teams, uncovering a new way to assess the ML model and specify its end-user requirements. We also present evidence of the utility of the onboarding materials by describing how it affected user strategies and decision-making with AI in a study deployment to pathologists.},

abstract = {Data in everyday life is represented in ways that are supposed to connect with our needs, tasks and situations, to inform and facilitate effectiveness and functionalism. And still, all we see are numbers, charts or graphics. We engage in sense-making all day through analytical interpretation, which is often not intuitive and causes friction whenever we encounter it in an everyday context. In our work, we aim for a different experience in everyday data-sensemaking that translates sensor data, time and data from external sources into lively, yet mundane video vignettes. The aim is to connect the experience to the phenomenon behind data, to deny data the stage and spotlight in our Everyday. This case study shows the design and implementation of a novel, interactive video installation that projects mundane data into an Everyday context, giving the data a new form and meaning. We work with video vignettes that are designed as short, neutral video fragments and show a person in different mundane situations, acting alone or interacting with props. The design process went through three iterations before the installation was exhibited as part of a group exhibition. We reflect on the most important design decisions, turning points in the process and how design and implementation are intertwined throughout the installation preparation. We conclude with a short overview of the contribution and an outlook to future work.},

abstract = {This work sits in the fields of Human Computer Interaction and accessibility research dedicated to the study and development of technology used by people who are blind or visually impaired. Increasingly, researchers have stated the need to get away from technological solutions that intend to ‘normalize’ disabled individuals, towards providing alternative ways that accommodate diverse bodies and minds. To achieve this, scholars and activists call for a shift in the design paradigm in which both the designers’ orientation and the design processes centre not only the needs of people with disabilities but also their lived experience and tacit knowledge. Moreover, more mainstream technologies must be built to accommodate them to the best extent possible, instead of leaving the responsibility to specialised assistive technologies. My PhD has been focused on uncovering and highlighting the competencies that people with visual impairments employ in their technology practices and how these are showcased, by closely examining a corpus of ethnographic data, including a comprehensive set of video demonstrations. Furthermore, my research aims to explore how these findings can be used for practical design within and beyond the accessibility and assistive technology fields, resulting in the production of resources that aid the design for supporting and extending such competencies.},

This is due to typical deployment of XR experiments inside laboratories, and a paucity of research into how to effectively conduct remote XR experimentation. This first CHI Remote XR workshop aims to explore the current state of the art around three main themes of remote XR experimentation: (i) participant recruitment and screening; (ii) data collection, including limitations and affordances of existing research and XR tools; and (iii) software frameworks and requirements for the effective design of encapsulated remote XR user studies. This workshop brings together researchers and practitioners in XR to explore these recently emerged themes and to imagine how effective future remote XR research might be conducted.},

abstract = {The emerging possibilities of multisensory interactions provide an exciting space for disability and open up opportunities to explore new experiences for perceiving one's own body, it's interactions with the environment and also to explore the environment itself. In addition, dynamic aspects of living with disability, life transitions, including ageing, psychological distress, long-term conditions such as chronic pain and new conditions such as long-COVID further affect people's abilities. Interactions with this diversity of embodiments can be enriched, empowered and augmented through using multisensory and cross-sensory modalities to create more inclusive technologies and experiences. To explore this, in this workshop we will explore three related sub-domains: immersive multi-sensory experiences, embodied experiences, and disability interactions and design. The aim is to better understand how we can re-think the senses in technology design for disability interactions and the dynamic self, constructed through continuously changing sensing capabilities either because of changing ability or because of the empowering technology. This workshop will: (i) bring together HCI researchers from different areas, (ii) discuss tools, frameworks and methods, and (iii) form a multidisciplinary community to build synergies for further collaboration.},

HCI has contributed to these discussions, mainly with studies on explainability of advanced algorithms. However, there are only few AI-systems based on machine learning algorithms that make it to the real world and everyday care. This challenging move has been named the “last mile” of AI in healthcare, emphasizing the sociotechnical uncertainties and unforeseen learnings from involving users in the design or use of AI-based systems. The aim of this workshop is to set the stage for a new wave of HCI research that accounts for and begins to develop new insights, concepts, and methods, for transitioning from development to implementation and use of AI in healthcare. Participants are invited to collaboratively define an HCI research agenda focused on healthcare AI in the wild, which will require examining end-user engagements and questioning underlying concepts of AI in healthcare.},

abstract = {Algorithmically mediated systems and tools are used by workers across the globe. Many of these workers are in low-power positions, where they have little leverage to make demands around transparency, explanation, or terms of use, yet, at the same time rely deeply on these systems for many aspects of their jobs. This tension between little power and high reliance drives the production of intensive algorithmic imaginaries, where workers engage in meaning-making to construct understandings of these systems. Yet, there has been little attention paid to the diversity and ingenuity of algorithmic understandings crafted by the workers. In this workshop, our goal is to bring together researchers and practitioners from across disciplines to create a research agenda, compare vocabularies, and discuss methodologies around this form of&nbsp;“folk tradecraft.” This toolkit will help elicit insights into these phenomena and ultimately build mechanisms by which the labor of algorithmic meaning-making can be respected, understood, and leveraged for system design.},

However, despite the recent increase in related CHI publications, older adults continue to be underrepresented in HCI research as well as commercially. Therefore, the overarching aim of this workshop is to increase the momentum for such research within CHI and related fields such as gerontechnology. For this, we plan to continue developing a space to discuss and share principles and strategies to design interactions and evaluate user interfaces (UI) for the ageing population. We thus welcome contributions of proposing improved empirical studies, theories, design and evaluation of UIs for older adults. Building on the success of the last three years’ workshops, we aim to grow the community of CHI researchers across borders interested in this topic by fostering a space to exchange results, methods, approaches, and ideas from research on interactive applications in support of older adults that are reflective of international diversity.},

abstract = {How long is a lifetime of practice in human-computer interaction? In my case, it has been 42 years, almost all of that in IBM Research (with a couple of sabbatical years in the then new Watson Group). Having queued up for access to DEC and Prime machines during my PhD work in the mid 70s, I was positively thrilled when, upon arriving at the T.J. Watson Research Center in 1978, I found a dedicated 3277 “green screen” terminal on my desk attached to a 370 mainframe. Hot-rodded with an onboard character buffer and double speed cursor circuitry, I could fly through writing and coding, personally experiencing the productivity benefits of sub-second response time [1].Beyond some great hardware (for the time), I also had extraordinary colleagues. I imprinted on the working style of John Gould and Stephen Boies as we built the second hardware iteration of what became the world's first commercial voice mail system and its final manifestation as the messaging system for the 1984 Summer Olympics. In this talk I'll share some of the still relevant behavioral principles of system design we learned in the course of that project [2].Beyond this, I'll review work in early (pre-Web!) Internet access for schools [3], home shopping [4], Web accessibility [5], and programmer productivity in peta-scale scientific computing [6]. Each project will highlight a barrier to building useful and usable systems, barriers that still persist. More importantly, I'll tell you how we overcame those barriers, giving you something that will, perhaps, be useful in your own work.},

abstract = {In this dissertation, I present measurement methods to automatically identify manipulative user interfaces—colloquially known as “dark patterns”—at scale on the web. Using these methods, I quantify the prevalence of dark patterns in three studies and show how dark patterns are rampant on the web, thus a pressing concern for society. First, I examine whether social media content creators, or “influencers,” disclose their relationships with advertisers to their audience. Analyzing over 500K YouTube videos and 2.1M Pinterest pins, I find that only about 10% of all advertising content is disclosed to users. Second, I examine various types of dark patterns in shopping websites. Analyzing data from 11K shopping websites, I discover over 1,800 dark patterns on over 1,200 websites that mislead users into making more purchases or disclosing more information than they would otherwise. Third, I examine dark patterns in political emails from the 2020 U.S. election cycle. Through an analysis of over 100K emails, I find that over 40% of emails from the median sender contain dark patterns that nudge recipients to open emails or make donations they might otherwise not make. I further outlay the conceptual foundation of dark patterns and articulate a set of normative perspectives for analyzing the effects of dark patterns. I conclude with how the lessons learned from the studies can be used to build technical defenses and to lay out policy recommendations to mitigate the spread of these interfaces.},

Then, based on the three-dimensional (3D) interaction characteristics of VR devices, we propose two vrCAPTCHA design prototypes (i.e., task-driven and bodily motion-based CAPTCHAs). We conducted a user study with six participants for exploring the feasibility of our two vrCAPTCHAs and traditional CAPTCHAs in VR. We believe that our two vrCAPTCHAs can be an inspiration for the further design of CAPTCHAs in VR.},

We believe that by immersing our bodies in virtual content, we foster creative self-expression, imagination, and thus design new lifestyles. This is the concept of Extensive Immersion. The Express Skin is equipped with a projector on its back, four pyramid-shaped projection modules on its front, and a LED lights system strengthening the visualization of gaming content by reacting simultaneously with the projections and with the tactile interaction (Figure 1: Full sketch of high-fidelity prototype). Through the creation of Expressive Skin, we want to ignite the fuse of fashion and gaming, as a viable way to achieve Extensive Immersion.},
