abstract = {Online arguments are an increasingly important and controversial part of modern life. From the spread of political conspiracies to managing relationships while socially distanced, the past several years have stressed the role technology plays in our interactions with one another. And unavoidably, part of maintaining relationships includes managing conflict and disagreements, from who does which chores to who’s a better political candidate. This SIG will bring together an interdisciplinary group of designers and researchers to discuss how to design, build, and evaluate systems to support constructive arguments online. We ask: How can online systems support conflict while sustaining and possibly strengthening interpersonal relationships? We will explore these questions in the context of a collaborative literature review across fields relevant to social computing and the psychology of conflict, paired with group discussion on how to design for disagreements.},

abstract = {This submission is intended to start a critical conversation about the ”Future of Work.” I expose the ideological commitments of major funders of research into this area, such as the NSF and private think tanks, because they shape narratives on work and worker organizing as well as the course of technology development more broadly. In the research itself, workers may be invited to participate in computing research, but they seldom determine the goals of projects nor do they own the results. Ultimately, while government agencies and nonprofit organizations claim to seek improved conditions for workers, the knowledge and technologies produced through this research serve primarily to undermine the power of working class people and their unions.},

abstract = {Gratitude, according to Oxford Language, is “the quality of being thankful; readiness to show appreciation for and to return kindness.” One way to express gratitude is through community service, however, we found that high school and college students find it difficult to access service opportunities, especially when busy with school and other extracurricular activities. After completing eight in-depth interviews, we found students had difficulty in finding opportunities that sparked their interest, contacting organizations, as well as keeping track of their hours for organizations such as service clubs or college Greek life. To solve these problems for students, we created VolunteerSpot: an app that allows high school and college students to easily find service opportunities at the tip of their finger. VolunteerSpot utilizes an interface for volunteers, where they can filter through service opportunities by category, and an interface for organizations, who can post job opportunities. The app employs a messaging feature for communication between groups, a review widget, and can filter service opportunities by category and proximity to the user. We hope that by creating VolunteerSpot, students can use our app to give back to their community and express gratitude in an easy and interactive way.},

abstract = {The concept of gamified interactive models and its novel extensions, such as playification, has been widely approached in order to engage users in many fields. In fields such as HCI and AI, however, these approaches were not yet employed for supporting users to create different forms of artworks, like a musical corpus. While allowing novel forms of interactivity with partially-autonomous systems, these techniques could also foster the emergence of artworks not limited to experts. Hence, in this research we introduce the concept of meta-interactivity for compositional interfaces, which extends an individual’s capabilities by the translation of an effort into a proficiency. We study how this approach can be effective through the development of novel systems that enables novices to compose coherent musical pieces through the use of imagetic elements in a virtual environment.},

abstract = {The majority of online video content remains inaccessible for blind people due to the lack of audio descriptions. Content creators have traditionally relied on professionals to author audio descriptions, but their service is costly and not readily available. In this research, I introduce four threads of research that I will conduct for my Ph.D. dissertation, aimed to create methods and tools that are both time- and cost-effective in providing good quality audio descriptions. They are: (i) The development and evaluation of mixed-ability collaboration authoring tool, (ii) The formative study to uncover the feedback pattern from the reviewer, (iii) the evaluation and generation of real-time supports for novice authors to write AD, and (iv) the design, development, and evaluation of a system that demonstrate the utility of semi-automatically authoring AD. I believe these four research threads help me to uncover a cheaper solution to generate audio description. Hence, motivating the content creator to include this accessibility feature in the video production process and making the existing and upcoming videos accessible.},

abstract = {Machines, computers, and robots play an increasingly important role in our personal and professional lives. In manufacturing industries, the direct physical collaboration between workers and robots is already reality today. To understand how humans perceive this collaboration, investigations regarding the effect of different robot behaviors and the characteristics that influence the perception by humans are required. Existing findings on the effect of human attributes and human-like appearance of robots point out several possibilities that improve interactions between humans and robots. However, these studies predominantly focus on humanoid robots. With regard to the increasing number of industrial robots and the arising economic potential of automation, the objective of my research is to gain in-depth understanding of human perception of robot movement behaviors. Achieving this requires insights on possible and perceptible robot behaviors in the non-humanoid field, how they are perceived and how they can be mapped to acceptance by humans. Based on this understanding, resulting interactions can be improved by adapting relevant behavior to the individual’s preferences. In view of new technologies and possibilities, it might even be possible to use real time data to classify humans and let robots adapt their behavior automatically.},

abstract = {Socially assistive robots (SARs) receive significant research attention due to their positive impact across many contexts. For example, studies have shown that autistic children are receptive to SARs in therapy, and achieve similar learning outcomes compared to human-delivered therapy. Given the sensitive nature of therapy and the current state of autonomous robots, however, SARs are in practice teleoperated by a therapist who controls their motion and dialogue. This presents an opportunity to produce more effective SAR teleoperation interfaces in the context of therapy for autistic children. In this paper, I outline research for improving teleoperation interfaces of SARs through (1) analyzing current teleoperation usage, (2) interviewing teleoperators about their needs, and (3) implementing and evaluating varied designs for teleoperation interfaces.},

abstract = {Entertainment is enjoyable and helps people to feel socially connected with others. However, the control of entertainment applications in group situations is often restricted to one person. This especially limits group decision-making where people sit in close proximity such as in the living room or inside a car. Restricting users in group decision-making can cause interpersonal conflicts and frustration. To overcome these aspects, my PhD research aims to articulate design principles to support social control. I specifically focus on distributing control across group members to support collaborative group decision-making and enhance social connectedness. To achieve this, I will design entertainment-oriented social control services for the car and the living room. Based on the exploration and designs for the car domain, I will transfer the gained knowledge to the living room, to verify and generalize my findings. This should support in drawing an overall conclusion for the design of general social control entertainment services. Thus, my dissertation contributes to the understanding of the design for future, entertainment-oriented, distributed control systems to best support group collaboration.},

abstract = {Explainability of AI systems is crucial to hold them accountable because they are increasingly becoming consequential in our lives by powering high-stakes decisions in domains like healthcare and law. When it comes to Explainable AI (XAI), understanding who interacts with the black-box of AI is just as important as “opening” it, if not more. Yet the discourse of XAI has been predominantly centered around the black-box, suffering from deficiencies in meeting user needs and exacerbating issues of algorithmic opacity. To address these issues, researchers have called for human-centered approaches to XAI. In this second CHI workshop on Human-centered XAI (HCXAI), we build on the success of the first installment from CHI 2021 to expand the conversation around XAI. We chart the domain and shape the HCXAI discourse with reflective discussions from diverse stakeholders. The goal of the second installment is to go beyond the black box and examine how human-centered perspectives in XAI can be operationalized at the conceptual, methodological, and technical levels. Encouraging holistic (historical, sociological, and technical) approaches, we put an emphasis on “operationalizing”, aiming to produce actionable frameworks, transferable evaluation methods, concrete design guidelines, and articulate a coordinated research agenda for XAI.},

abstract = {In the wake of the hype around big data, artificial intelligence, and “data-drivenness,” much attention has been paid to developing novel tools to capitalize upon the deluge of data being recorded and gathered automatically through IT systems. While much of this literature tends to overlook the data itself—sometimes even characterizing it as “data exhaust” that is readily available to be fed into algorithms, which will unlock the insights held within it—a growing body of literature has recently been directed at the (often intensive and skillful) work that goes into creating, collecting, managing, curating, analyzing, interpreting, and communicating data. These investigations detail the practices and processes involved in making data useful and meaningful so that aims of becoming ‘data-driven’ or ‘data-informed’ can become real. Further, In some cases, increased demands for data work have led to the formation of new occupations, whereas at other times data work has been added to the task portfolios of existing occupations and professions, occasionally affecting their core identity. Thus, the evolving forms of data work are requiring individual and organizational resources, new and re-tooled practices and tools, development of new competences and skills, and creation of new functions and roles. While differences exist across the global North and the global South experience of data work, such factors of data production remain paramount even as they exist largely for the benefit of the data-driven system [21, 32]. This one-day workshop will investigate existing and emerging tasks of data work. Further, participants will seek to understand data work as it impacts: individual data workers; occupations tasked with data work (existing and emerging); organizations (e.g. changing their skill-mix and infrastructuring to support data work); and teaching institutions (grappling with incorporation of data work into educational programs). Participants are required to submit a position paper or a case study drawn from their research to be reviewed and accepted by the organizing committee (submissions should be up to four pages in length). Upon acceptance, participants will read each other's paper, prepare to shortly present and respond to comments by two discussants and other participants. Subsequently, the workshop will focus on developing a set of core processes and tasks as well as an outline of a research agenda for a CHI-perspective on data work in the coming years.},

In our partner hospital, representing many similar clinics, these processes often still rely on exchanging physical papers and forms, making patient or case data challenging to access. This often leads to phone calls with long waiting queues, which are time-inefficient and result in frequent interrupts. We report on a user-centered design approach based on Rapid Contextual Design with an additional focus group to optimize and iteratively develop a new workflow. Participants found our prototypes fast and intuitive, the design clean and consistent, relevant information easy to access, and the request process fast and easy. Due to the COVID pandemic, we switched to remote prototype testing, which yielded equally good feedback and increased the participation rate. In the end, we propose best practices for remote prototype testing in hospitals with complex and distributed workflows.},

To users who do not have available social support, the app provides a foundation to receive support from a community of volunteers who are social connections to other users. Meerkat also includes a practice mode, facilitating social learning by presenting users with mobile tasks. We conclude with how Meerkat can contribute to collective and individual efficacy.},

In this paper, we propose a design of 3D-printed resistive soft sensors that can detect deformation by creating internal lattice structures with flexible conductive materials. The magnitude of deformation can be detected by measuring the resistance between a pair of electrodes. By adjusting the parameters of the lattice structure, a soft sensor with high flexibility of shape design and adjustable local softness can be realized. In addition, by inserting non-conductive structures into the sensor structure, external wires can be consolidated in one place. We present a design and fabrication pipeline, and investigate the fundamental characteristics of several patterns of sensors. We also show several applications that demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method.},

abstract = {Voice user interfaces (VUIs) have the problems in discoverability and learnability. Conventional VUIs tried to solve these problems by listing voice commands for using features on the screen of devices in combination with GUIs. However, with these VUI help tools, it is difficult to know how accurately the commands must be spoken and to determine whether the target operation is being executed if the words are rephrased or spoken incorrectly during speaking. Therefore, users are too preoccupied with speaking phrases correctly, and the advantage of VUIs, which can be used without awareness of the operation method, has not been fully demonstrated. To address these issues, we propose KaraokeVUI, which is a VUI help tool for supporting voice operation with feedback by displaying spoken words through filling in the blanks or overlaying on phrases, just like on a karaoke screen. In this paper, we evaluate and verify KaraokeVUI usefulness and usability.},

For bidirectional languages (e.g., Arabic and Hebrew), it is essential to highlight an additional parameter – the direction of the UI item. However, investigating the correct direction of all items could involve costly research. Hence, it is important to set priorities for such research. While prioritizing usability issues has long been attended by the HCI community, the specific problem of this research is new and has never been addressed. To deal with this challenge, we conducted five focus groups with HCI professionals and identified a set of prioritization criteria. We then used those criteria to prioritize the UI items for future empirical evaluation of their preferred directionality. In addition to these findings, we provide some insights from our experience of using focus groups for the prioritization task.},

Forming a critical part of the food delivery platform, the algorithm’s obscurity and shifting nature is a part of its design. In this paper we argue that adapting usability techniques like the Critical Incident Technique (CIT) may provide one way to better understand algorithms and platform work. Though there are many methods to understand algorithms like this, asking people about negative or positive interactions with them and what they think provoked them can produce fruitful avenues for HCI research into the impacts of platforms on gig-economy work. We argue that despite the results being an assumption, assumptions from the algorithmically managed are interesting materials to challenge the researchers’ own assumptions about their context, and to, therefore, better scope out contexts and iterate future research.},

Nevertheless, HCI has little insight into how technological mediation influences religious experiences and how technology should be designed for use in religious contexts. Therefore, we see a unique opportunity to understand better real-world experiences of technology use in religious rituals and, more specifically, in online worship services. Inspired by contextual design, We virtually observed and interviewed eight persons during and after participation in online worship services. We identified a field of tension between faith, everyday life, individuality, and community. The data suggests that current online worship service systems do not account for believers’ needs for community, faith, or extraordinariness. We discuss opportunities for future research and design, and aim to contribute to the understanding of online worship service experiences and the design of technology-mediated religious experiences.},

With the technological advancements, these systems are becoming more adaptable to the users’ needs and can better imitate a human personality. To achieve that efficiently, understanding how different users envision their desired assistant is crucial. To identify people’s customization and personalization preferences and their desired personality for a home assistant, we designed a set of storyboards depicting a variety of possible features in a domestic setting and conducted a user study (), including a series of semi-structured interviews. Our quantitative results suggest that users prefer an agent which is highly agreeable and has higher conscientiousness and emotional stability. Furthermore, we discuss users’ customization and personalization preferences for a home assistant, which could be considered when designing the future generation of home assistants.},

abstract = {Recommender systems have the potential to improve the user experience of digital mental health apps. Personalised recommendations can help users to identify therapy tasks that they find most enjoyable or helpful, thus boosting their engagement with the service and optimising the extent to which it helps them to feel better. Using a dataset containing 23,476 ratings collected from 973 players of a mental health therapy game, this work demonstrates how collaborative filtering algorithms can predict how much a user will benefit from a new therapy task with greater accuracy than a simpler baseline algorithm that predicts the average rating for a task, adjusted for the biases of the specific user and specific task. Collaborative filtering algorithms (matrix factorisation and k-nearest neighbour) outperform this baseline with a 6.5-8.3% improvement in mean absolute error (MAE) and context-aware collaborative filtering algorithms (factorisation machines) outperform with a 7.8-8.8% improvement in MAE. These results suggest that recommender systems could be a useful tool for tailoring recommendations of new therapy tasks to a user based on a combination of their past preferences, the ratings of similar users, and their current context. This scalable approach to personalisation – which does not require a human therapist to always be in-the-loop – could play an important role in improving engagement and outcomes in digital mental health therapies.},

Our findings suggested that participants generally found the reflection questions helped them better perceive how they use Instagram in terms of their use habits and mental states.

They can look at images of the product, read reviews, make comparisons with other products, do research online, read expert reviews, and more. Voice shopping (purchasing items via a Voice assistant such as Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant) is different. Voice introduces novel challenges as the communication channel is limited in terms of the amount of information people can and are willing to absorb. Because of this, the system should choose the single most effective nugget of information to help the customer, and present the information succinctly. In this paper we report on a within-subject user study (N = 24), in which we employed three template-based methods that use information from customer reviews, product attributes and search relevance signals to generate helpful supporting information. Our results suggest that: (1) supporting information from customer reviews significantly improves participants perception of system effectiveness (helping them make good decisions); (2) supporting information based on search relevance signals improves user perception of system transparency (providing insight into how the system works). We discuss the implications of our findings for providing supporting information for customers shopping by Voice.},

Today, asymmetric communication between a VR user and other non-VR users remains a challenge. The VR user cannot see the external non-VR users, and the non-VR users are restricted to the VR user’s first-person view. To address this, we propose WebTransceiVR, an asymmetric collaboration toolkit which when integrated into a VR application, allows multiple non-VR users to share the virtual space of the VR user. It allows external users to enter and be part of the VR application’s space through standard web browsers on mobile and computers. These external users can explore and interact with the other users, the VR scene as well as the VR user. WebTransceiVR also includes a cloud-based streaming solution that enables many passive spectators to view the scene through any of the active cameras. We conduct informal user testing to gain additional insights for future work.},

abstract = {Deep conceptualization and reflection of online information is essential to people’s knowledge acquisition and decision-making in high-stakes domains, such as health. Reflective thinking, however, demands extra cognitive efforts, resources and skills, and therefore could deter people from taking further steps to question information encountered online. In this paper, we proposed a digital nudging tool for supporting critical reflection of video contents based on concept mapping and peer commenting mechanisms. The proposed tool, DeepThinkingMap, aims to promote people’s understanding and reflection of video content via interface features that foster the disclosure of personal conceptualization and transparency of personal beliefs about the video. By seeing how peers conceptualize and reflect about the video content, the concepts and comments made available to people could potentially serve as a ”thinking nudge,” allowing individuals to reap in-depth thoughts about the video otherwise inaccessible to them. Through a proof-of-concept controlled evaluation, we found that seeing peer thoughts through DeepThinkingMap significantly increased content comprehension, and fostered greater efforts for reflection in comparison to the baseline of receiving no nudge. The study contributes to understanding the socio-technical-cognitive mechanisms and the design space of social nudging that may be utilized to support reflection and critical thinking toward high-stakes information.},

As different types of users e.g. students, journalists, etc. adopt these algorithms, it is imperative that user experience with text summarization AI systems is modified to allow agency. To explore this, we designed an interactive multi-document summarization system, called Living Documents, that allows agency over the summarization process. We evaluated this system in a preliminary study with 25 students identified from Prolific. The students perform summarization tasks using the control functions in our system. Results from this study show that these functions contributed to the user’s understanding of how summarization works and this understanding slightly impacts user trust in our system positively. We discuss our experience designing for user control of a normally automated, complex process that produces immutable output and the future implications for other applications.},

abstract = {The data collected in shared spaces are usually used to understand how occupants use the space. However, these data could also inform the experience of the occupants in these spaces over time. How could we leverage spatial and temporal memories as mediators among occupants of a shared physical space? We developed Memory Portal, an interactive mirror that reflects the shadows and sounds of past occupants of a shared physical space in the present. We conducted a short user study to explore how the occupants of a shared space perceive the interactions with the reflected memories. One of our key finding is that the occupants formed a novel perspective about their actions and experience in the space through these memories. Our contributions include introducing a novel technical system and new approaches of data engagement in shared physical spaces through the visualization and sonification of memories of the presence of its occupants.},

abstract = {The common layer-by-layer deposition of regular, 3-axis 3D printing simplifies both the fabrication process and the 3D printer’s mechanical design. However, the resulting 3D printed objects have some unfavourable characteristics including visible layers, uneven structural strength and support material. To overcome these, researchers have employed robotic arms and multi-axis CNCs to deposit materials in conformal layers. Conformal deposition improves the quality of the 3D printed parts through support-less printing and curved layer deposition. However, such multi-axis 3D printing is inaccessible to many individuals due to high costs and technical complexities. Furthermore, the limited GUI support for conformal slicers creates an additional barrier for users. To open multi-axis 3D printing up to more makers and researchers, we present a cheap and accessible way to upgrade a regular 3D printer to 5 axes. We have also developed a GUI-based conformal slicer, integrated within a popular CAD package. Together, these deliver an accessible workflow for designing, simulating and creating conformally-printed 3D models.},

Second, we designed and implemented a novel interactive system that helps the user repeatedly train these skills in the 5 stages of drawing a nice car in an accurate perspective. Our novel interactive technique, Tick'n'Draw, inspired by the drawing habits of experts, provides friendly guidance so that the user does not get lost in the many steps of perceptual and perspective drawing. Third, through a pilot test, we found that our system is quick to learn, easy to use, and can potentially improve real-world drawing abilities with continued use.},

Experts have been trying to enhance public's awareness of Hua'er protection through digital documentation technology, but there's no efficacious means to attract interest and popularize knowledge yet. In this paper, we propose an interactive VR system engaging audiences to experience and understand the connotation of Hua'er performance. Based on an online survey with the public and in-depth interviews with Hua'er experts, we derive a set of design requirements for generating embodied storytelling and interactive experience in VR. Accordingly, we design “Hua'er and the Youth” (HY) that integrates three methods (virtual avatar, participatory performance, and game-based knowledge acquisition) and conduct a between-subjects user study to compare HY with the Comparison system. The results suggest that our methods significantly improved audience's interactive experience, knowledge level and the awareness of ICH safeguarding.},

abstract = {The ability to successfully infer private behavioral intentions using publicly-available digital records has a far-reaching impact. Unlike other private attributes such as demographic attributes, an intention oftentimes leads to a near-future behavior. Prior knowledge about such future behaviors can be seen as “actionable intelligence” and constitutes a significantly bigger risk to users’ privacy than knowledge of non-behavioral attributes. In this paper, we present a novel, multidisciplinary methodology for behavioral-intention inference. Using Bayesian-Networks, we model a behavioral intention using a set of causes that influence the intention’s formation, a set of effects that are caused by the intention, and various dependency relations within and between those sets. Unlike the methodologies used in prior attribute-inference works, which are oftentimes tailored to a single target attribute, our methods can be applied to different types of intentions from a diverse set of domains as we demonstrate by applying our model to multiple real-world intention-inference tasks.},

As a result, many individuals with disabilities struggle to access adequate sex education with negative consequences such as unplanned pregnancies, body image issues and sexual exploitation. To explore needs and practices for accessing relevant and reliable information about disability and sexuality, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 5 participants. Results show that there are several topics which participants thought should be better explored in the context of disability and sexuality, but most available sex education resources are not inclusive. Moreover, people with disabilities, especially when young or less used to self-advocate for their own needs, face difficulties engaging in meaningful conversations around sexuality. Based on the results of our research, we make recommendations for areas where HCI research could significantly contribute to make intimate interactions more accessible.},

Next, a within-subjects user testing study was performed to compare two functional prototypes that differed only in their structure: one replicated the existing website structure, whereas the other implemented the structure produced by card sort data analysis. Results showed that participants using the redesigned structure had significantly better usability metrics (first click success rate, task time, SEQ score and SUS score) compared to when interacting with the existing structure. These findings provide support for the validity of the open card sorting method for the design of website information structures.},

Specifically, PlusMe is designed to stimulate the children’s curiosity and encourage behaviour on the basis of social interaction. The pilot test involved five high-functioning children, mean age 41 months, range 36-50 months. The participants were engaged in play activities together with the PlusMe toy and two researchers who aimed to encourage the children’s social behaviour such as imitation and eye contact; the activities were repeated for four sessions (one per week). Although it is an ongoing study on a larger sample, the first data analysis is promising, preliminary observations seem to demonstrate that PlusMe can be used to improve some social behaviour such as eye contact, imitation, the interaction between two people.},

abstract = {With the development of social media, various rumors can be easily spread on the Internet and such rumors can have serious negative effects on society. Thus, it has become a critical task for social media platforms to deal with suspected rumors. However, due to the lack of effective tools, it is often difficult for platform administrators to analyze and validate rumors from a large volume of information on a social media platform efficiently. We have worked closely with social media platform administrators for four months to summarize their requirements of identifying and analyzing rumors, and further proposed an interactive visual analytics system, RumorLens, to help them deal with the rumor efficiently and gain an in-depth understanding of the patterns of rumor spreading. RumorLens integrates natural language processing (NLP) and other data processing techniques with visualization techniques to facilitate interactive analysis and validation of suspected rumors. We propose well-coordinated visualizations to provide users with three levels of details of suspected rumors: an overview displays both spatial distribution and temporal evolution of suspected rumors; a projection view leverages a metaphor-based glyph to represent each suspected rumor and further enable users to gain a quick understanding of their overall characteristics and similarity with each other; a propagation view visualizes the dynamic spreading details of a suspected rumor with a novel circular visualization design, and facilitates interactive analysis and validation of rumors in a compact manner. By using a real-world dataset collected from Sina Weibo, one case study with a domain expert is conducted to evaluate RumorLens. The results demonstrated the usefulness and effectiveness of our approach.},

We present a user study (N=20) that investigates how the use of real-world cues and different VR environments affect users’ feelings of safety, social acceptability, awareness, presence, escapism and immersion, which are key barriers to VR adoption. Our findings show that knowing where other people are on the bus could significantly reduce concerns associated with VR use in transit, resulting in increased feelings of safety, social acceptability and awareness, but with the concession that the user's immersion may be reduced. The VR environment also affected the level of immersion and the feelings of escapism, with a 360-video environment returning higher scores than a 2D one.},

Consequently, we synthesized four scenarios (motor learning, virtual reality, media player control, and pedestrian safety) based on various dimensions identified by the literature review. We assessed their user acceptance in an online survey (N=113) using the technology acceptance model (TAM). Our findings suggest that users may reject EMS systems if they perceive a high level of risk and lack of control over the environment. This was evident even in scenarios that could provide high benefits to users, such as accelerating the learning curve in motoric tasks. In contrast, EMS seems to be widely accepted for games and entertainment, represented by the virtual reality scenario in our study. HCI researchers should employ EMS to create more engaging VR experiences, keep users in control, and provide them the option of learning skills with or without EMS. Our results will help build better EMS systems accepted by users.},
