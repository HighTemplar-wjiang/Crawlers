Participants wear an EEG headset and use their neural activity to alter visuals that are projection-mapped, in real-time, onto an explorable maze in an exhibition space. Their neural data also influences interactive audio. Audiences wear an EEG headset and help shape the installation audio-visuals, or they can explore the exhibition maze and be immersed in audio-visuals that are being shaped by another person's neural data. This case study investigates ways of personalising Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) displays so that people can feel a closer connection to their neural data. It also provides insights into how BCIs can support novel interpersonal engagement.},

abstract = {How would your organization's employees respond to a deployment of virtual reality based training? Would they be excited, inspired, or perhaps intimidated by new technology? We tested the accessibility of virtual reality (VR) as a modality for training PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) employees, and we observed negative and positive sentiments associated with various approaches to VR engagement. This case study presents our efforts to improve VR headset onboarding and game play experience by analyzing user experience from the time they show up for the VR learning experience to the time they leave. We describe learner capabilities and skills required to interact with the headset and voice-recognition technology in a simulation based learning experience, the methods we used to identify user sentiments and infer causes, as well as our efforts to address user needs by adjusting our VR learner experience design. In selecting our test user population, we attempted to represent the diversity of PwC learner demographics, including gender, ethnicity, employee role / function, practice group within PwC, and other characteristics that could have had a material impact on VR equipment use, such as prior experience with VR, use of eyeglasses, and presence of various accents when speaking. Our heterogenous group of testers pushed us to acknowledge user sensitivities, which we had previously underestimated. We changed our VR onboarding protocol in order to mitigate reticence to learning in VR. We believe that as the technology becomes more prevalent in the enterprise and more employees experience the value VR brings to the training experience, the overall sentiment toward VR will continue to improve. We hope our study motivates continued research to improve accessibility of VR technology, enterprise implementation of VR, user-interface design, and voice recognition technologies used in gameplay.},

The digital switch has come with many benefits such as lowering barriers, mobile work environments and mass production for distribution of work. Along with these benefits we also see challenges for art and design work and its future perception in society. As technology takes a more significant role in supporting art and design what will this mean for the individual artist or designer? The focus of this workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners to explore what the future of digital art and design will hold. The exploration will centre around synthesizing key challenges and questions, along with ideas for future interaction technologies that consider mobile and tangible aspects of digital art.},

With this in mind, the purpose of our workshop is as follows. First, to provide a platform for researchers and practitioners to engage with these issues that often remain hidden when discussions solely focus on technology. Second, to develop a draft research agenda for challenges that will serve as a primer for future studies examining the topic.},

Biometric authentication methods promise to fulfill both aspects to a high degree, yet they come with severe drawbacks, such as the lack of changeability of the utilized trait, in case it is leaked or stolen. To compensate for these disadvantages, we introduce a novel class of biometric authentication systems in this work, named "Functional Biometrics". This approach regards the human body as a function that transforms a stimulus which is applied to the body by the authentication system. Both, the stimulus and the measured body reflection form a pair that can subsequently be used for authentication, yet the underlying function remains secret. Following this approach, we intend to disprove some of the drawbacks of traditional biometrics.},

In this paper, we examine whether group size would influence the effects of goal setting and goal sharing on reducing academic procrastination. Through a three-week field study followed by interviews, 21 participants were randomly assigned to three 2-people groups and three 5-people groups. They used a suite of mobile applications to set up their study goals, track their study and distraction time, and share their goals with other group members for 2 weeks. Results suggest that the 5-people groups had achieved better outcomes than the 2-people groups considering less fluctuation and more deduction in average distraction rate (distraction time divided by study time). We conclude by proposing several design implications concerning the design of mobile applications to reduce academic procrastination, and identify several future research directions on this topic.},

Furthermore, a proper interface of a shared gaze awareness cue is designed to enhance communication between the occupant and the designer(s). The system also has a face window feature that allows designer(s) to share their facial expressions and upper body gesture with the occupant in order to exchange and express information in a nonverbal context. Combined together, the OmniGlobeVR allows collaborators between the VR and non-VR platforms to cooperate while allowing designer(s) to easily access physical assets while working synchronously with the occupant in the VR space.},

Studying users' reactions to inferences made about them, especially what surprises them, allows us to better understand this gap. We interviewed users of Google and Facebook to learn their current beliefs and expectations about how these platforms use their data to make inferences, and identified four common sources of surprise for participants: irrelevant inferences, outdated inferences, inferences with no connection to online activity, and inferences related to friends or family. We discuss the implications for designing inference-generating systems.},

abstract = {Scatterplots are one of the most common data visualisation methods. Designing scatterplots for large data sets is challenging, as overlapping markers are likely to cause loss of information. Poorly chosen marker opacity, shape, or size may lead to e.g. overplotting or diminished visibility of outliers. The challenge is amplified by having to wait for rendering every time the design is changed. To reduce designer effort, optimisation-based approaches to scatterplot design have been proposed, most comprehensive being an algorithm by Micallef et al. (2017) that applies image-based perceptual quality measures to automatic evaluation of scatterplots. However, their approach suffers also from poor rendering performance, discouraging usage in interactive applications. This paper presents an algorithm applying abstract rendering for efficiently updating scatterplot markers regardless of data set size. We show how our approach enables fast, interactive design and adjustment of overlap in scatterplots, demonstrated with a proof-of-concept visualisation tool.},

abstract = {Whilst studying Human-Computer Interaction, students and work-place learners rarely encounter sketching, yet such practice has been shown to improve cognitive processes and increase retention of information. Additionally, it is a valuable method of ideation and communication for both subjective and group-based projects. We propose further integration of sketching practice within HCI and computer science curricula, both to preserve this valuable skill for use in research and industry, and to widen the perspectives of those working with subjects often seen as grounded in code or logic. SketCHI #3 will bring together those interested in enhancing student's and colleagues experience in a hands-on meeting of minds and sketching, with the aim to share best practice and knowledge for those interested in expanding our views on education in the field, and to co-create a Sketching in HCI education plan with a body of knowledge.},

Capturing the perspectives of community-based health care workers (N=14) using wearable technology for servicing pregnant women provided insight into considerations for technology for this specific population. Methods of inquiry included design and development of a prototype wearable and mobile system as well as self-report via a survey detailing their experience with the system and how it can possibly benefit their duties of monitoring their pregnant patients. The process outcomes of this work, however, provide broader insight into the challenges of conducting this kind of interdisciplinary work that remain despite decades of effort and financial investment to support interdisciplinary research, particularly in health informatics and interactive technologies for health.},

Assisting users in negotiating permissions for services and managing known personal data trails is currently a significant design challenge. However, as this landscape is rapidly evolving year by year, what is urgently needed is for designers to speculate, ideate and design for emergent and near-future data trails. This one-day workshop will bring together a wide range of researchers, practitioners and designers working in areas such as smart cities, smart homes, responsible research &amp; innovation, surveillance, privacy, IoT, smart energy and beyond, in order to ideate and design around emergent personal data trails. The intended outcome of the workshop is to co-create a suite of signs, signals and signifiers with the purpose of acquainting and empowering users to navigate and manage these types of data.},

abstract = {Electroencephalogram (EEG) based emotion recognition has received significant research attention since it allows the direct reflection of the inner state of the brain activity. However, it is difficult to improve the performance of recognizing cross-subject emotion due to subjectivity and the noise associated with EEG data collection. In this paper, we propose a novel cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition method with combination of channel-wise features and LSTM. The channel-wise feature is defined by the symmetric matrix, the element of which is calculated by the Pearson correlation coefficient between two-pair channels to consider the spatial interaction among all channels. Then, the channel-wise features are fed to the 2-layer stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), which can extract temporal features and learns an emotional model that can complementarily handle subjectivity and noise. The experiments on two publicly available datasets DEAP and SEED demonstrate the effectiveness of the combined use of channel-wise features and LSTM. Experimental results achieve state-of-the-art classification rate of 98.93% and 99.10% over 2-classes valence and arousal on DEAP respectively and show the accuracy of 99.63% over 3-classes classification on SEED.},

We explored the effects of users' perception of AI systems' warmth (perceived intent) and competence (perceived ability) on their choices. In a series of studies, we manipulated AI systems' warmth and competence levels. We show that, similar to the judgments of other people, there is often primacy for warmth over competence. Specifically, when faced with a choice between a high-competence system and a high-warmth system, more participants preferred the high-warmth system. Moreover, the precedence of warmth persisted even when the high-warmth system was overtly deficient in its competence compared to an alternative high competence-low warmth system. The current research proposes that it may be vital for AI systems designers to consider and communicate the system's warmth characteristics to its potential users.},

Prior methods reduce redundancy by presenting peers’ ideas or peer-proposed prompts, but these require much human coordination. We introduce Directed Diversity, an automatic prompt selection approach that leverages language model embedding distances to maximize diversity. Ideators can be directed towards diverse prompts and away from prior ideas, thus improving their collective creativity. Since there are diverse metrics of diversity, we present a Diversity Prompting Evaluation Framework consolidating metrics from several research disciplines to analyze along the ideation chain — prompt selection, prompt creativity, prompt-ideation mediation, and ideation creativity. Using this framework, we evaluated Directed Diversity in a series of a simulation study and four user studies for the use case of crowdsourcing motivational messages to encourage physical activity. We show that automated diverse prompting can variously improve collective creativity across many nuanced metrics of diversity.},

However, it remains challenging for developers to create custom gestures for their applications. Conventional strategies to bespoke gesture recognition involve either hand-crafting or data-intensive deep-learning. Neither approach is well suited for rapid prototyping of new interactions. This paper introduces a flexible and efficient alternative approach for constructing hand gestures. We present Gesture Knitter: a design tool for creating custom gesture recognizers with minimal training data. Gesture Knitter allows the specification of gesture primitives that can then be combined to create more complex gestures using a visual declarative script. Designers can build custom recognizers by declaring them from scratch or by providing a demonstration that is automatically decoded into its primitive components. Our developer study shows that Gesture Knitter achieves high recognition accuracy despite minimal training data and delivers an expressive and creative design experience.},

Through interviews and data logging, we found that residents preferred games that were closer to their interests and skills, and that gameplay and cooperation fostered meaningful and shared interactions between residents and their visitors. The contribution of this work is twofold: (1) insights and opportunities into dyadic interactions when using an app and into promoting positive social experiences through technology design, and (2) reflections on the challenges of evaluating the benefits of technology for people living with dementia.},

In this paper, we use three of our bodily play systems to illustrate how designers can engage with limited control over the body by varying the player's degree of indirect control (for instance, via other bodily activity and external triggers). We also propose four strategies for employing limited control over the body: Exploration, Reflection, Learning and Embracement. We hope our own work and the strategies developed from it will assist designers to employ limited control over the body, ultimately helping people benefit from engaging their bodies through play.},

We analysed social interactions during a keynote, small group breakouts, and informal networking/hallway conversations. Our mixed-methods approach combined environment logging, observations, and semi-structured interviews. The results demonstrate how small and large spaces influenced group formation, shared attention, and personal space, where smaller rooms facilitated more cohesive groups while larger rooms made small group formation challenging but personal space more flexible. Beyond our findings, we show how the combination of data and insights can fuel collaborative spaces’ design and deliver more effective virtual workshops.},

PCOS causes different symptoms for different people, with no singular or universal cure. Being a stigmatized and enigmatic condition, it is challenging to discover, diagnose, and manage PCOS. This work aims to inform the design of inclusive health technologies through an understanding of people’s lived experiences and challenges with PCOS. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 10 women diagnosed with PCOS and analyzed a PCOS-specific subreddit forum. We report people’s support-seeking, sense-making, and self-experimentation practices, and find uncertainty and stigma to be key in shaping their unique experiences of the condition. We further identify potential avenues for designing technology to support their diverse needs, such as personalized and contextual tracking, accelerated self-discovery, and co-management, contributing to a growing body of HCI literature on stigmatized topics in women’s health and well-being.},

By using rows and columns of electrodes, specialized touch controllers are able to capture a 2D image of capacitance at the surface of a screen. For over a decade, capacitive “pixels” have been around 4 millimeters in size – a surprisingly low resolution that precludes a wide range of interesting applications. In this paper, we show how super-resolution techniques, long used in fields such as biology and astronomy, can be applied to capacitive touchscreen data. By integrating data from many frames, our software-only process is able to resolve geometric details finer than the original sensor resolution. This opens the door to passive tangibles with higher-density fiducials and also recognition of every-day metal objects, such as keys and coins. We built several applications to illustrate the potential of our approach and report the findings of a multipart evaluation.},

Building on these, we show how the design space takes into account the goals of introducing technology, that design decisions can be either directly designed, or left open for appropriation by end-users; and the social organization of the practice. We characterize prior work based on the design space elements, which yields trends and opportunities for design. Our contributions can help designers think about key design decisions, exploit trends and explore new areas in the domain of wearables for sports and fitness practices.},

abstract = {Eye gaze and head movement are attractive for hands-free 3D interaction in head-mounted displays, but existing interfaces afford only limited control. Radi-Eye is a novel pop-up radial interface designed to maximise expressiveness with input from only the eyes and head. Radi-Eye provides widgets for discrete and continuous input and scales to support larger feature sets. Widgets can be selected with Look &amp; Cross, using gaze for pre-selection followed by head-crossing as trigger and for manipulation. The technique leverages natural eye-head coordination where eye and head move at an offset unless explicitly brought into alignment, enabling interaction without risk of unintended input. We explore Radi-Eye in three augmented and virtual reality applications, and evaluate the effect of radial interface scale and orientation on performance with Look &amp; Cross. The results show that Radi-Eye provides users with fast and accurate input while opening up a new design space for hands-free fluid interaction.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose the designs for low cost and 3D-printable add-on components to adapt existing breadboards, circuit components and electronics tools for blind or low vision (BLV) users. Through an initial user study, we identified several barriers to entry for beginners with BLV in electronics and circuit prototyping. These barriers guided the design and development of our add-on components. We focused on developing adaptations that provide additional information about the specific component pins and breadboard holes, modify tools to make them easier to use for users with BLV, and expand non-visual feedback (e.g., audio, tactile) for tasks that require vision. Through a second user study, we demonstrated that our adaptations can effectively overcome the accessibility barriers in breadboard circuit prototyping for users with BLV.},

abstract = {Reflection is an often addressed design goal in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research. An increasing number of artefacts for reflection have been developed in recent years. However, evaluating if and how an interactive technology helps a user reflect is still complex. This makes it difficult to compare artefacts (or prototypes) for reflection, impeding future design efforts. To address this issue, we developed the Technology-Supported Reflection Inventory (TSRI), which is a scale that evaluates how effectively a system supports reflection. We first created a list of possible scale items based on past work in defining reflection. The items were then reviewed by experts. Next, we performed exploratory factor analysis to reduce the scale to its final length of nine items. Subsequently, we confirmed test-retest validity of our instrument, as well as its construct validity. The TSRI enables researchers and practitioners to compare prototypes designed to support reflection.},

This interview study explored how people with food hypersensitivities avoid reactions while eating out, to inspire future digital technology design. Our findings show the social and emotional impact of food hypersensitivities and how people practically cope by investigating restaurants’ safety precautions, correcting orders, or even educating restaurants’ staff. We discuss our findings against the experiences of other people living with chronic conditions and offer design opportunities for digital technologies to enhance dining out experiences of people with food hypersensitivities.},

abstract = {Recently, consumer-facing health technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based symptom checkers (AISCs) have sprung up in everyday healthcare practice. AISCs solicit symptom information from users and provide medical suggestions and possible diagnoses, a responsibility that people usually entrust with real-person authorities such as physicians and expert patients. Thus, the advent of AISCs begs a question of whether and how they transform the notion of medical authority in people's everyday healthcare practice. To answer this question, we conducted an interview study with thirty AISC users. We found that users assess the medical authority of AISCs using various factors including AISCs’ automated decisions and interaction design patterns, associations with established medical authorities like hospitals, and comparisons with other health technologies. We reveal how AISCs are used in healthcare delivery, discuss how AI transforms conventional understandings of medical authority, and derive implications for designing AI-enabled health technology.},

Comprehension is often stymied when the information needed to understand a passage resides somewhere else—in another section, or in another paper. In this work, we envision how interfaces can bring definitions of technical terms and symbols to readers when and where they need them most. We introduce ScholarPhi, an augmented reading interface with four novel features: (1) tooltips that surface position-sensitive definitions from elsewhere in a paper, (2) a filter over the paper that “declutters” it to reveal how the term or symbol is used across the paper, (3) automatic equation diagrams that expose multiple definitions in parallel, and (4) an automatically generated glossary of important terms and symbols. A usability study showed that the tool helps researchers of all experience levels read papers. Furthermore, researchers were eager to have ScholarPhi’s definitions available to support their everyday reading.},

abstract = {With growing interest regarding cooperation support using Augmented Reality (AR), social presence has become a popular measure of its quality. While this concept is established throughout cooperation research, its role in AR is still unclear: Some work uses social presence as an indicator for support quality, while others found no impact at all. To clarify this role, we conducted a literature review of recent publications that empirically investigated social presence in cooperative AR. After a thorough selection procedure, we analyzed 19&nbsp;publications according to factors influencing social presence and the impact of social presence on cooperation support. We found that certain interventions support social presence better than others, that social presence has an influence on user's preferences and that the relation between social presence and cooperation quality may depend on the symmetry of the cooperation task. This contributes to existing research by clarifying the role of social presence for cooperative AR and deriving corresponding design recommendations.},

To generate haptic feedback, the use of permanent magnets as the mechanism potentially contributes to simpleness and robustness; however, it is difficult to manually design how magnets should be embedded in the objects. Our approach enables the inverse design of magnetic force feedback; that is, we computationally solve an inverse problem to obtain an optimal arrangement of permanent magnets that renders the user-specified haptic sensation. To solve the inverse problem in a practical manner, we also present techniques on magnetic simulation and optimization. We demonstrate applications to explore the design possibility of augmenting digital fabrication for everyday use.},

We report on the case of immunization in Pakistan, where, through interviews with 30 mid-level vaccination managers in Punjab district, we find that data falsification by vaccinators is common, though not necessarily rampant. Because of an intricate protocol for record-keeping, supervisors can detect data falsification, and we find they have devised an array of methods, broadly classifiable into four types: triangulation, supplementary data collection, anomaly detection, and interrogation. We also find that the strategies that supervisors use to detect falsification seem linked to their style of management, with authoritarian supervisors preferring supplementary data collection and spot checks, while supportive supervisors use triangulation. Our findings lead to recommendations for designing technologies intended to monitor and manage front-line data.},

By sparse authentication and continuous tracking of the user’s status, Auth+Track eliminates the “gap” authentication between fragmented sessions and enables “Authentication Free when User is Around”. To instantiate the Auth+Track model, we present PanoTrack, a prototype that integrates body and near field hand information for user tracking. We install a fisheye camera on the top of the phone to achieve a panoramic vision that can capture both user’s body and on-screen hands. Based on the captured video stream, we develop an algorithm to extract 1) features for user tracking, including body keypoints and their temporal and spatial association, near field hand status, and 2) features for user identity assignment. The results of our user studies validate the feasibility of PanoTrack and demonstrate that Auth+Track not only improves the authentication efficiency but also enhances user experiences with better usability.},

Using our original 360-degree Telepresence system and smartphones running Zoom, we enabled the deceased’s elder siblings to remotely attend the funeral and did our utmost to make them feel present in the funeral hall. Despite the webcasting via Zoom contributing more to their remote attendances than our system, we discovered thoughtful findings which could be useful for designing remote funeral attendances. From the findings, we also discuss how HCI designers can contribute to this highly sensitive issue, weaving together knowledge from various domains including techno-spiritual practices, thanato-sensitive designs; and other religious and cultural aspects related to death rituals.},

Still, research has remained inconclusive on how presence is affected by human factors such as emotion and agency. Here we adopt a novel design to investigate their effects by testing virtual environments inducing either happiness or fear, with or without user agency. Results from 121 participants showed that the dominant emotion induced by a virtual environment is positively correlated with presence. In addition, agency had a significant positive effect on presence and, furthermore, moderated the effect of emotion on presence. We show for the first time that the effects of emotion and agency on presence are not straightforward but they can be modelled by separating design factors from subjective measures. We discuss how these findings can explain seemingly conflicting results of related work and their implications for VR design.},
