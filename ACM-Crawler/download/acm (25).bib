abstract = {With rapid advances in streaming technology and the rise of esports, spectating other people playing video games has become a mass phenomenon. Today, both live video game streaming and esports are a booming business attracting million of viewers. This offers an opportunity for Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research to explore how to support spectator experiences. This workshop aims to foster discussion on how technology and HCI can help to transform the act of spectating games and particularly esports from a passive (watching) to a more active - and engaging - experience. Through this workshop we aim to explore opportunities for research, promote interdisciplinary exchange, increase awareness, and establish a community on the subject matter.},

abstract = {Head-mounted displays (HMDs) that provide a virtual reality (VR) experience using a simple configuration have been become popular. However, HMDs still have a well-known problem in that they hide the user's face when worn making it difficult for their avatars in VR space to communicate with each other because the users cannot relay their facial expressions and gaze information to their avatars. In this paper, we propose a new HMD constructed using polarizing plates that can capture the user's face and expressions while wearing it. The proposed method enables the user's face to be captured by an internal camera while blocking the scenery from the user's view using orthogonal polarizing plates. The proposed method can be implemented at low cost and can directly capture a full-color image of the user's face unlike conventional methods using infrared cameras. We implemented a prototype and confirmed that the proposed HMD captures the user's face while showing VR images. This paper discusses the unique characteristics and possible applications of the proposed method.},

The key idea is to mark different instances of a 3D model by varying slicing parameters that do not change the model geometry but can be detected as machine-readable differences in the print. As a result, G-ID does not add anything to the object but exploits the patterns appearing as a byproduct of slicing, an essential step of the 3D printing pipeline.We introduce the G-ID slicing &amp; labeling interface that varies the settings for each instance, and the G-ID mobile app, which uses image processing techniques to retrieve the parameters and their associated labels from a photo of the 3D printed object.},

abstract = {A Facebook Messenger chatbot, Sunny, was designed and deployed to promote positive social connections and enhance psychological wellbeing. A 10-day study was conducted with three pre-existing social groups of four members each in control (n=12) and experimental groups (n=12). Both groups completed initial assessments and daily reports, and the experimental groups interacted with Sunny. Exit interviews indicated three key themes: 1) Sunny prompted self-reflection, boosting participants' senses of self-worth and the depth of their relationships, 2) using Sunny encouraged participants to send heartfelt messages they would not have shared otherwise, 3) participants enjoyed accessing positive messages "on-demand". Experimental groups showed an average increase in psychological wellbeing of 1.73 (std = 6.08), compared to 0.5 (std = 5.94) in control. Our results suggest that an AI-based chatbot like Sunny could provide preventative care, promoting strong social connections and psychological wellbeing.},

However, there is still a lack of quantitative research for evaluating the influence of the flow state on learning outcomes. One of the issues related to flow experience identification is that used techniques are often invasive or not suitable for massive applications. The current paper suggests a way to deal with this challenge. We describe a methodology based on multimodal learning analytics, aimed to provide automatic students' flow experience identification in the gamified assignments and measuring its influence on the learning outcomes. The application of the developed methodology showed that there are correlations between learning outcomes and flow state, but they depend on the initial level of the user. This finding suggests adding dynamic difficulty adjustment and other flow experience dimension to the gamified assignment.},

abstract = {The only known therapy for stroke, a major leading cause of death and disability, has to be administered within 3 hours of the onset of symptoms for it to be effective. Accurately diagnosing a stroke as soon as possible after it occurs is difficult as it requires a subjective evaluation by a clinician in a hospital. With the narrow time window required for diagnosis, stroke evaluation would benefit from being aided by computational approaches that identify and quantify stroke symptoms in an efficient way. Here, we propose the design of a novel interface that provides clinicians with visualizations of the results of a machine learning-based technological aid for stroke diagnosis. To effectively support clinicians in determining stroke type, the proposed approach allows them to compare their own manual stroke evaluation with the results of the diagnostic system. By developing and evaluating our prototypes with neurologists, we explore how to best integrate technological aids into busy hospital workflows without burdening clinicians or biasing their decision making processes. We found that properly balancing the predictions of humans with that of technology is key to promoting the adoption of the latter in hospitals.},

To distinguish a learner's guessing behavior from solution behavior, we present an explorative study of using motion features, which represent a learner's finger movements on a tablet screen. Our data was collected from the Missing Number game of KitKit School, a tablet-based math game designed for children from pre-K to grade 2 in elementary school. A total of 5,040 problem solving logs, which were collected from 168 students, were analyzed. A two-sample t-test showed a significant difference between guessing and solution behavior for four groups of motion features that indicate distance, curvedness, complexity, and pause (p&lt;0.001). Additionally, our empirical results showed the possibility of using motion features in automatic detection of guessing behavior. Our best model yielded an accuracy of 0.778 and AUC value of 0.851 by using the random forest classifier.},

Recently, there has been a growing interest in including clinicians as builders of Do-It-Yourself (DIY) AT. To identify the needs of clinicians-as-makers, we investigated the challenges that clinicians faced as they volunteered in an AT building project where they were the primary designers and builders of assistive mobility devices for children. Through observation and co-building of modified ride-on toy cars with clinicians, we found that the rapid pace of development and transient relationship between user and builder did not allow for a complete assessment of the child's mobility. Furthermore, clinicians struggled to actualize concepts borne out of their clinical intent due to a lack of engineering skill. This study highlights the need for tools that support clinicians-as-makers in the AT maker process and a new conceptualization of the role of DIY-AT maker programs within the AT provider ecosystem.},

Standing in line at shops, stations, and other crowded places is one of such tasks. Therefore, we developed a system to detect and notify the distance to a person in front continuously by using a smartphone with a RGB camera and an infrared depth sensor. The system alerts three levels of distance via vibration patterns to allow users to start/stop moving forward to the right position at the right timing. To evaluate the effectiveness of the system, we performed a study with six blind people. We observed that the system enables blind participants to stand in line successfully, while also gaining more confidence.},

abstract = {Automatic figure captioning is widely useful for improving the readability and accessibility of figures. Despite recent advances in figure question answering and parsing figure elements that enable machines to accurately read information from figures, the machine learning community still lacks sufficient understanding of this problem, on what contents are important to include in a caption and how to make it sound natural. In this work, we crawled, annotated, and analyzed a corpus of real-world human-written figure captions. Our study results show that real-world captions usually consist of a finite set of caption units and that automatic figure captioning should be formulated as a multi-stage task. The first stage is to generate caption units with high accuracy and the second is to stitch together the units with diverse stitching patterns, to form a natural caption.},

abstract = {Blind people face various local navigation challenges in their daily lives such as identifying empty seats in crowded stations, navigating toward a seat, and stopping and sitting at the correct spot. Although voice navigation is a commonly used solution, it requires users to carefully follow frequent navigational sounds over short distances. Therefore, we presented an assistive robot, BlindPilot, which guides blind users to landmark objects using an intuitive handle. BlindPilot employs an RGB-D camera to detect the positions of target objects and uses LiDAR to build a 2D map of the surrounding area. On the basis of the sensing results, BlindPilot then generates a path to the object and guides the user safely. To evaluate our system, we also implemented a sound-based navigation system as a baseline system, and asked six blind participants to approach an empty chair using the two systems. We observed that BlindPilot enabled users to approach a chair faster with a greater feeling of security and less effort compared to the baseline system.},

Interestingly current research largely omits visually impaired older adults. As the outcome of our iterative design process, we introduced the design of the tactile map that employs haptically salient key objects and large touch-sensitive segments along with the route-guidance function. Route-guidance function enriches the tactile map with the desired route information to support the route knowledge acquisition. Qualitative evaluation (mean age was 81.4 years) indicates the ability of our concept to help our audience building spatial knowledge of the indoor environment.},

Currently, few task-oriented chatbots had employed emotion strategies together with problem solving process. Meanwhile, customers can have different preference across channels (e.g., social media and webpages). This paper presented the design for a series of emotional strategies (ES) combined with task-solving, and tested its effectiveness across channels. In the multi-channel service chatbot, Moli, we compared ES with brief apology (BA) and no emotion responses (NER) in a Wizard of Oz study. The results indicated the effectiveness of the emotion strategies borrowed from psychotherapy technologies. Meanwhile, we found customers preferred brief and direct strategies on webpage, whereas rich emotional strategies in all stages were more favorable on social media. With detailed strategy design, the "cold comfort" was found helpful for building human-machine relationships, pacifying emotions, and improving satisfaction and system usability.},

However, we often observe that many speakers simply read the script without making eye contact, thereby lowering audience engagement. Practice with proper tools could benefit a speaker considerably. In this work, we iteratively designed ScriptFree, an adaptive speech practice environment where off-the-shelf automatic speech recognition (ASR) is leveraged to measure a speaker's preparation level, and accordingly, the script is adaptively compressed to reduce the speaker's visual reliance toward script mastery. The user study results confirmed that ScriptFree helped the participants to success- fully improve their speech over multiple practice iterations. The results have significant design implications for building adaptive speech practice systems.},

We conducted a user study where participants experienced four unique perspectives, that of a two-year-old child, an eight-year-old child, an adult and a person in a wheelchair by manipulating their virtual inter-pupillary distance and eye height. We found that varying SSP had significant impacts on the perceived level of risk, heights of the identified risk, and the number of risks discovered. The results yielded empirical evidence to support that experiencing different SSP, can potentially help identify issues during an architectural design process for various groups of users.},

User experience (UX) focuses on improving user interactions, but little work has investigated how companies factor user experience into the security and privacy design of smart home devices as a means of addressing these concerns. To explore this in more detail, we designed and conducted six in-depth interviews with employees of a large smart home company in the United Kingdom. We analyzed the data using Grounded Theory, and found little evidence that UX is a consideration for the security design of these devices. Based on the results of our study, we proposed user-centered design guidelines and recommendations to improve data protection in smart homes.},

In this late-breaking work, we aim at clarifying this issue by investigating how digital nudges can reduce the addictive features of social media and other addictive sites. More precisely, we present the design of NUDGE, a novel browser extension that aims to make social media less addictive by delivering digital nudges founded on behavioral science. We conducted a preliminary evaluation of NUDGE with 67 actual users and 14 university students. Our results show that NUDGE (1) helped users to become reflective of their social media usage, (2) possibly decreased their time spent, and (3) made the experience more pleasant.},

We hypothesize that the adoption of this heuristic might affect user behaviour and present a diet plan for users who wish to take responsibility for their own e-waste by eating it. Finally we propose an alternative direction for HCI researchers to design and advocate for those affected by the material properties of e-waste.},

In HCI, this understanding has been incorporated in concepts like embodied interaction, bodily play, and natural user-interfaces.

Considering this, we are provided with an opportunity to extend human capabilities through augmenting motor memory. Augmentation of motor memory is now possible with the advent of new and emerging technologies including neuromodulation, electric stimulation, brain-computer interfaces, and adaptive intelligent systems. This workshop aims to explore the possibility of augmenting motor memory using these and other technologies. In doing so, we stand to benefit not only from new technologies and interactions, but also a means to further study cognition.},

However, despite an emerging focus on immersive analytics research, there is currently a lack of coherent and broadly applicable visualisation and interaction design in order to make immersive analytics systems productive and usable in real world scenarios. In this workshop, we propose to identify a road-map towards productive user interfaces for immersive analytics. In particular we aim to understand how we can effectively support specific visualisation and analytics tasks in VR/AR, and identify the interactions needed to support these. Our goal is to catalyse the research community and lead toward a reference paper to inform future research.},

abstract = {While standard VR controllers lack means to convey realistic, kinesthetic impressions of size, resistance or inertia, this demonstration presents Drag:on, an ungrounded shape-changing interaction device that provides dynamic passive haptic feedback based on drag, i.e. air resistance, and weight shift. Drag:on leverages the airflow at the controller during interaction. The device adjusts its surface area to change the drag and rotational inertia felt by the user. When rotated or swung, Drag:on, conveys an impression of resistance, which we previously used in a VR user study to increase the haptic realism of virtual objects and interactions compared to standard controllers. Drag:on's feedback is suitable for rendering virtual mechanical resistances, virtual gas streams, and virtual objects differing in scale, material and fill state. In our demonstration, participants learn about this novel feedback concept, the implementation of our prototype and can experience the resistance feedback during a hands-on session.},

Yet the pervasiveness of these warnings is limited by their reliance on content creators and hosts. Rather than placing the sole responsibility of content moderation on content creators and hosts, our system shows a strong proof-of-concept for automatically generating content warnings on the user's side by utilizing keyword identification, sentiment analysis, and online intervention user interface principles. We designed our system as a Chrome extension and evaluated it by testing its accuracy on a dataset of websites with and without sensitive content, and performing a user-interaction lab study. With promising future areas of research such as the ability to personalize thresholds and customize content warnings for specific user needs, this research is a step towards a psychologically safer internet for everyone.},

If you do not drink water at a fast enough rate, the bottle will overflow and spill. This reminds the user that they haven't drunk enough, aggressively nudging them to drink in order to prevent further spillage. This persuasive technology attempts to motivate conscious decision making by drawing attention to the user's drinking habits. Furthermore, we evaluated the emotions and opinions of potential users towards Disruptabottle, finding that participants generally received the device positively; with 59% reporting that they would use the device and 92% believing it to be an effective way of encouraging healthy drinking habits.},

For people with autism, the integration of these two streams can be disrupted by the tendency to privilege details (local processing) instead of seeing the big picture (global processing). Consequently, people with autism may struggle with typical visual attention, evidenced by their verbal description of local features when asked to describe overall scenes. This paper aims to explore how one adult with autism see and understand the global filter of natural scenes.},

We present PinchType: A new method of virtual text entry that combines users' existing knowledge of the QWERTY keyboard layout with simple thumb and finger interactions. Users pinch with the thumb and fingertip to select from the same group of letters the finger would press on a QWERTY keyboard; a language model disambiguates. In a preliminary study with 14 participants, we investigated PinchType's speed and accuracy on initial use, as well as its physical comfort relative to a mid-air keyboard. After entering 40 phrases, most people reported that PinchType was more comfortable than the mid-air keyboard. Most participants reached a mean speed of 12.54 WPM, or 20.07 WPM without the time spent correcting errors. This compares favorably to other thumb-to-finger virtual text entry methods.},

However, due to the progression of their dementia, adaptions to standard interviewing processes for gathering the narratives were needed. Through the use of multi-sensory stimulates (visual and somatic), over time, we were able to understand our participants' narratives as well as their personhood. Furthermore, the adaptions led to questioning the importance of narrative accuracy and the ultimate purpose of building the albums. The next phase is to evaluate the long-term effects of the creation process and the albums themselves.},

abstract = {We engineered a wearable microphone jammer that is capable of disabling any microphones in the user's surroundings, including hidden microphones. Our device is based on a recent exploit that leverages the fact that when exposed to ultrasonic noise, commodity microphones will leak the noise into the audible range. This allowed us to build a novel wearable microphone jammer that is worn as a bracelet on the user's wrist and jams ubiquitously. We found that our device outperforms state-of-the-art jammers. (1) Existing jammers built from multiple transducers exhibit blind spots, i.e., locations in which transducers destructively interfere and where a microphone cannot be jammed; instead, our wearable jammer leverages natural hand gestures that occur while speaking, gesturing or moving around to blur out blind spots. (2) Existing jammers are directional, requiring users to point the jammer to a microphone; instead, our wearable jams in multiple directions. This is beneficial in that it allows our jammer to even protect against microphones out of sight, such as those hidden behind everyday objects.},
