abstract = {In this mixed-methods study, we attempt to capture users’ conception of AI through the two-dimensional mind perception framework (perceived agency vs. experience) in cognitive psychology [13] and a series of drawing tasks. Our data illustrate how participants perceive AI entities with physical embodiment, depicting AI through devices, imaginary human figures, or full techno-ecosystems. Furthermore, we apply users’ mind maps of AI entities to highlight risks in human-AI interaction (HAII) and propose design solutions accordingly. We posit HAII research and development should be cognizant that users possess existing AI images and should exploit them as starting points for design improvement.},

abstract = {Contemporary digital services often adopt mechanisms, e.g., recommendations and infinite scrolling, that exploit users’ psychological vulnerabilities to maximize time spent and daily visits. While these attention-capture dark patterns might contribute to technology overuse and problematic behaviors, they are relatively underexplored in the literature. In this paper, we first provide a definition of what are attention-capture dark patterns based on a review of recent works on digital wellbeing and dark patterns. Then, we describe a set 5 of attention-capture dark patterns extracted from a 1-week-long auto-ethnography during which we self-monitored our mobile and web interactions with Facebook and YouTube. Finally, we report on an initial study (N = 7) that explores whether and how a widespread mechanism, i.e., social investment, influence usage and users’ perception of the Facebook website. We discuss the implications that our work may have on the design of technologies that better align with users’ digital wellbeing.},

abstract = {Radar is primarily used for applications like tracking and large-scale ranging, and its use for object identification has been rarely explored. This paper introduces RaITIn, a radar-based identification (ID) method for tangible interactions. Unlike conventional radar solutions, RaITIn can track and identify objects on a tabletop scale. We use frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar sensors to classify different objects embedded with low-cost radar reflectors of varying sizes on a tabletop setup. We also introduce Stackable IDs, where different objects can be stacked and combined to produce unique IDs. The result allows RaITIn to accurately identify visually identical objects embedded with different low-cost reflector configurations. When combined with a radar’s ability for tracking, it creates novel tabletop interaction modalities. We discuss possible applications and areas for future work.},

abstract = {The high cost of dispatching professionals to physically audit locations limits the coverage of accessibility maps. Vision-based techniques and crowdsourcing using streetscape imagery are beneficial as they do not entail physical visits by people to actual locations. However, they exhibit limitations such as outdated photos and occlusions. In-the-field crowdsourcing enables physical collection of accessibility information at a low cost. The effectiveness of this technique is contingent on people with free time and high motivation to visit actual locations. In this paper, we introduce a crowdsourcing platform for constructing accessibility maps that support people with diverse free times and motivations. A combination of field auditing and field sensing, coupled with including and excluding gamification is explored. Game types are determined based on the characteristics of field auditing and field sensing. The experimental results confirm that gamification improves the motivation levels and performance of participants in certain aspects of crowdsourced field auditing and crowdsourced field sensing. Furthermore, the results indicate that item collection games have a greater impact on the motivation for taking unusual roads to collect accessibility information than continuous walking games.},

abstract = {Due to the pandemic, social media has become an essential route to satisfy socializing needs. Expanding from dominant services like Facebook and Instagram, a new wave caused a stir—Clubhouse as a voice-centered social media platform. Despite its worldwide popularity after its launch in 2020, general properties of Clubhouse have not been actively discussed. Accordingly, this study explores Clubhouse's opportunities and challenges as a voice-centered social media through its user experiences. We conducted interviews with regular Clubhouse users (N=26) to gain insight into their motivation, social networking, and conversations. Findings highlight that voice is effective for establishing social relationships via interactivity and intimacy, mutual respect, and convenience from ephemerality. Conversely, users reported patterns of the privacy paradox and the oligopoly of communication. Design guidelines for future voice-centric social media are proposed. Our initial study of Clubhouse will encourage more dialogues on voice-centered social media and its potential as a major platform.},

abstract = {Virtual Reality (VR) has potential vulnerabilities in privacy risks from collecting a wide range of data with higher density. Various designs to provide information on Privacy Policy (PP) have improved the awareness and motivation towards privacy risks. However, most of them have focused on desktop environments, not utilizing the full potential of VR’s immersive interactivity. Therefore, we proposed a role-playing mechanism to provide an immersive experience of interacting with PP’s key entities. First, our formative study found insights for PP where VR users had limited awareness of what data to be collected and how to control them. Following this, we implemented a VR privacy tutorial based on our role-playing mechanism and PP from off-the-shelf VR devices. Our privacy tutorial increased a similar amount of privacy awareness with significantly higher satisfaction (p=0.007) than conventional PP. Our tutorial also showed marginally higher usability (p=0.11).},

The design of active urban environments can be an effective tool to encourage more active behaviors and water features can attract people, improving their experience of the urban space. To explore the potential of these concepts, we designed Fontana; an interactive public installation that aims to stimulate physical activity and social connectedness in the urban outdoor space, using the multidimensional attractiveness of water. We focus on the use of embedded interactive technology to promote physical activity, using water as a linking element between users. Adopting a research-through-design approach, we explored how such installations can nudge people into an active behavior while additionally strengthening social connectedness, using inclusive design principles. We report on insights gathered through this case study and findings of a preliminary user test, discussing the implications of this work for design researchers and practitioners.},

abstract = {While affective non-verbal communication between pedestrians and drivers has been shown to improve on-road safety and driving experiences, it remains a challenge to design driver assistance systems that can automatically capture these affective cues. In this early work, we identify users’ emotional self-report responses towards commonly occurring pedestrian actions while crossing a road. We conducted a crowd-sourced web-based survey (N=91), where respondents with prior driving experience viewed videos of 25 pedestrian interaction scenarios selected from the JAAD (Joint Attention for Autonomous Driving) dataset, and thereafter provided valence and arousal self-reports. We found participants’ emotion self-reports (especially valence) are strongly influenced by actions including hand waving, nodding, impolite hand gestures, and inattentive pedestrian(s) crossing while engaged with a phone. Our findings provide a first step towards designing in-vehicle empathic interfaces that can assist in driver emotion regulation during on-road interactions, where the identified pedestrian actions serve as future driver emotion induction stimuli.},

Understanding this process could to lead to improvements in face to face and remote collaboration. In this paper we report on an experiment exploring the relationship between eye gaze and inter-brain synchrony in Virtual Reality (VR). The experiment recruited pairs who were asked to perform finger-tracking exercises in VR with three different gaze conditions: averted, direct, and natural, while their brain activity was recorded. We found that gaze direction has a significant effect on inter-brain synchrony during collaboration for this task in VR. This shows that representing natural gaze could influence inter-brain synchrony in VR, which may have implications for avatar design for social VR. We discuss implications of our research and possible directions for future work.},

abstract = {Over the past decade, initiatives to design for subjective well-being have gained increased attention and momentum in design research. These initiatives often draw from positive psychology to explore ways of making Positive Psychology Interventions (PPIs) more effective through technology. This paper explores how a mix of tangible and digital technology can realize activity-focused, diverse Emotion Regulation (ER) for its users. We propose that ER strategies can serve as a principle for designing technology that encourages users to savor, modify, reassess, or commemorate their experiences. By centering the design around music listening experiences, the paper explores how users can be supported to lower motivation hurdles that get in the way of frequent engagement with a PPI by developing three exploratory prototypes and reflecting on the development processes. Variapsody, a music listening device, integrates three features, each deploying a different set of ER strategies that make the experience more enjoyable and meaningful. Variapsody's regulatory diversity offers users the choice of how to approach music listening and expands their repertoire of ER strategies. The first feature, Reaction Tile, inscribes users’ reactions to music onto a tangible, domino-sized tile to encourage them to savor the music. The second is Monofilter, which purposefully muffles the salience of background music while working on a cognitively demanding task. Vibelist is the third feature that helps users capture and revisit the context of music listening experiences in a digital collage. The paper discusses the lessons learned and future research opportunities.},

We present the first measurement study of Apple privacy nutrition labels to understand how apps on the U.S. App Store create and update privacy labels. We collected weekly snapshots of the privacy label and other metadata for all the 1.4 million apps on the U.S. App Store from April 2 to November 5, 2021. Our analysis showed that 51.6% of apps still do not have a privacy label as of November 5, 2021. Although 35.3% of old apps have created a privacy label, only 2.7% of old apps created a privacy label without app updates (i.e., voluntary adoption). Our findings suggest that inactive apps have little incentive to create privacy labels.},

In this paper, we explore discrete visual guides that assist users’ stroke accuracy and drawing experience inside the virtual environment. We also present an eye-tracking study that compares continuous, discrete, and no guide in a basic drawing task. Our experiment asks participants to draw a circle and a line using three different guide types, three different sizes and two different orientations. Results indicate that discrete guides are more user-friendly than continuous guides, as the majority of participants preferred their use, while we found no difference in speed/accuracy compared to continuous guides. Potentially, this can be attributed to distinct eye-gaze strategies, as discrete guides led users to shift their eyes more frequently between guide points and the drawing cursor. Our insights are useful for practitioners and researchers in 3D sketching, as they are a first step to inform future design applications of how visual guides inside the virtual environment affect visual behaviour and how eye-gaze can become a tool to assist sketching.},

This element provides transparency as to why feedback was shown at any given moment, and can increase cooperation and empowerment for both the teacher and the children. We present the human centered design process and early results from a user study with 12 children. Our findings show high engagement with the system, and user awareness before texting.},

Specifically, opening-encounters between strangers form a complex social context and often involve awkwardness and tension. We explored whether augmenting everyday objects with autonomous capabilities can facilitate an opening-encounter between strangers. A pair of robotic bar-stools were designed to rotate participants sitting on them. We evaluated the opening-encounter experience in three conditions: bar-stools rotating participants towards one another; bar-stools rotating participants away from one another; and bar-stools with no rotation. Our initial findings indicate that rotating participants towards each other led to positive encounters, encouraged social interaction, and increased interpersonal communication. The other two conditions were less likely to initiate social interactions. This preliminary study highlights the potential of facilitating positive opening-encounters using autonomous furniture that are perceived as a natural part of the interaction, without altering its human-human nature.},

We survey approaches that aim to provide such guidance in a prescriptive way. We further propose a preliminary approach, called Method Cards, which aims to increase the transparency and reproducibility of ML systems by providing prescriptive documentation of commonly-used ML methods and techniques. We showcase our proposal with an example in small object detection, and demonstrate how Method Cards can communicate key considerations for model developers. We further highlight avenues for improving the user experience of ML engineers based on Method Cards.},

abstract = {Learning menstruation in early adolescence could reduce teenagers’ misunderstanding of it and help them treat menstruation in a proper way. This paper explored a tangible game for teenagers of different genders learning menstruation through collaborative playing. The game included five levels where users play together and learn the cause, products, symptoms of menstruation as well as try to judge some scenarios and listen to audios about menstruation. In our user study, we invited three groups of teenagers ages 11 to 16. Each group contained at least one male and one female, and we let them play the game freely. Teenagers were successfully able to play the game collaboratively, learn menstruation-related knowledge. The results revealed motivation differences related to gender, and after the game, teenagers demonstrated the observable change of the attitude towards menstruation.},

This space can be used as virtual placeholders for user interfaces where users can access them by moving their watch. In this paper, we present a novel face-centered spatial user interface for smartwatches that leverages the mid-air space for augmenting virtual user interfaces. With a pilot study, we first examine the suitable mid-air space that users can access during active use while wearing smartwatches. Next we conduct an online survey investigating users’ attitudes towards using the space to access mid-air user interfaces. More specifically, we focus on the social acceptance of face-centered spatial user interfaces in different locations and in front of different audiences. Results indicate that participants welcomed the idea of face-centered spatial user interfaces, however, the acceptance varied based on where and in front of whom they are using the space.},

The Attentional Visual Field Task (AVF) is an established, computerized method for assessing the distribution of visual attention across a wide visual field. High-fidelity virtual reality (VR) presents an opportunity for more ecological methods for assessing and training visual attention; however, this novel approach has not been examined. We developed a new VR-based AVF task, AVF-VE, using a Head-Mounted Display (HMD) VR device with an integrated eye-tracker, and conducted a study to validate this newly developed visual attention task. We further examined how visual attention is distributed in a virtual visual field. The findings suggest that the VR-based visual attention task is a valid and useful tool that can be used for future attention research and training. Unique characteristics of the spatial distribution of visual attention in the virtual environment observed in the current evaluation study are discussed.},

abstract = {The elderly population worldwide got immensely affected by the increased isolation and risk for complications due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Notably, elderly women get more affected by social isolation and distress irrespective of health factors. We aim to understand how urban elderly women in Southeast Asia – typically highly dependent on the other family members due to cultural practices – took care of their mental health with uncertainty and distress using technology during the social distance period. Through 19 semi-structured interviews with participants from six Southeast Asian countries and analyzing the data using thematic analysis, we surfaced that our participants started learning different technology with great enthusiasm and used them for their mental well-being during the pandemic period. This paper portrays how our participants enhanced interpersonal bonding, cultivated self-care and creative outlets, and facilitated positivism around their social circle using different technology platforms to mitigate their stress and uncertainty during the pandemic. Our participants’ technology usage for better mental well-being during the COVID-19 period provides HCI researchers with valuable design guidelines. Here, we contribute by expanding the HCI community’s understanding of technology design within the intersection of the elderly population and mental health for the Southeast Asian cultural context.},

How do users react to social media outage? Do they become anxious? Or, do they enjoy these brief episodes of social media detox? To answer these questions, we conducted a topic modeling analysis of 223,815 tweets that used the hashtag #facebookdown during the major Facebook outage on 10/4/2021. We uncovered 10 major themes of users’ reactions towards social media outage. Results showed that most users complained, mocked and showed desperation about the outage situation, and during the outage period, increased their quest for other social-media alternatives. Also, surprisingly, many users celebrated the detox from Facebook rather than wishing it to come back as soon as possible. Results offer design implications for practitioners who would like to better respond to future outages.},

In this paper, we explore the impacts of LBA on small businesses in the LBG Pok\'{e}mon GO, a lacuna in the literature. We gather participant experience through a collection of 35 semi-structured interviews with businesses leveraging Niantic’s sponsored location LBA. These testimonies indicate (1) participant businesses found LBG advertising to be satisfactory, (2) LBG advertising improves brand recognizability for local commerce, and (3) local community is an important factor for success in LBG advertising. These findings indicate future patterns for integrating local businesses into LBG like Pok\'{e}mon GO, suggesting potential for LBG advertising to assist local businesses.},

Someone with UEI has reduced use of their shoulders, upper arms, forearms, hands, and/or fingers. We conducted six (6) semi-structured interviews with participants with UEI in the US. We found that people with UEI increased computing device use during COVID-19 not only for remote interactions but also in person. Additionally, social distancing for COVID-19 safety created the need for new assistive technology (AT), authentication requirements, and communication platforms, which introduced their own accessibility barriers. We also found that personal protective equipment (PPE) created new barriers during computing device use, which often caused people with UEI to choose COVID-19 safety over the usability of their computing devices. Based on these findings, we describe future opportunities to make computing devices more accessible for people with UEI to manage the shifts in computing device use introduced by COVID-19.},

Understanding physical and behavioural aspects of robot design is important to promote acceptance in human-robot interaction. In this study, we focus on robot initiative-taking as a behavioural aspect and investigate how it influences human perception and emotion during human-robot interaction. We built on previous work using questionnaires to evaluate user impressions in the presence or absence of robot activeness (initiative-taking). We also used Galvanic skin response (GSR) as a physiological measure to gauge participants’ emotion during interaction. Questionnaire analysis confirmed that generally active robot behaviour improved human impression. Moreover, the order of interaction seems to matter for participants to take more notice of robot initiative-taking. GSR analysis supported the questionnaire results, showing that on average participants were more emotionally aroused during an active interaction and that order of interaction somewhat mattered.},

A mixed methods research design, including both accessibility and usability concerns, allowed us to capture the user interactions, observe them, and access their expressed perception of usability. Findings show the universal nature of mainstream solutions does not support the diversity of PLV.

In this study, we analyze social media users’ behaviors by means of a user journey. We create VisualBubble, a design probe that encourages reflection-oriented user experiences during news consumption on social media. We test our design probe with 10 users, to determine its effectiveness in increasing users’ critical reflection on their news consumption behaviors. The initial findings show that VisualBubble can contribute to more critical attitudes towards the news that users are exposed to and, therefore, has the potential to mitigate social media misinformation.},

abstract = {Southeast Asia that consists of eleven countries, has been proud of its way of life and rich culture and is generally happy to maintain its long comforting tradition. However, the region cannot deny that its diverse population and strategic location have become a center of attention for global players to invest in the region. With the emergence of Industry 4.0, digital transformation has become mandatory for any organizations or nations in Southeast Asia to consider. Through SEACHI (Southeast Asian CHI) Symposium, we aim to grow awareness in HCI and UX to improve the design and development of technology for a living and bring together the Southeast Asian academic researchers and industry practitioners. As HCI is maturing in Asia, we identified the remarkable growth and needs of HCI in the Southeast Asian community. In this symposium, we have several questions that we would like to answer: To what extent the HCI and UX that has been taught and practiced in Southeast Asia met the needs to support the digital transformation initiatives in the region; whether there has been any significant and proper contextualization of the HCI and UX fields; whether HCI and UX are still perceived as a Western mindset instead of a localized approach to make a difference in any projects; whether HCI and UX have become a standard norm in the digital product and design process and how HCI and UX players in Southeast Asia have worked together to create a unique ecosystem. Under the big conference theme “Equity, Justice and Access Commitments,” the symposium aims to bring about equal and fair access for anyone to exchange information and transfer knowledge in this multidisciplinary environment and multi-socioeconomic aspects of research and practice HCI and UX in Southeast Asia.},

abstract = {Modern approaches to second language (L2) pedagogy emphasise communicative competence as part of the language teaching goals. However, it has been observed that some learners are more willing to engage in L2 communication than others, and that this disposition may be affected by several variables that are not bounded to their linguistic competence. In the case of migrants, who are required to learn and use a second language to integrate into their new environment, there is a critical need for opportunities and resources to support their Willingness to Communicate (WTC) beyond the classroom. Intelligent personal assistants (IPA) offer a dynamic oral conversational opportunity in language learning that seems to have potential for improving language learners’ Willingness to Communicate. As part of this doctoral study, a conversational experience will be designed to bring together conversational and instructional principles that take into consideration the learners’ needs, their environment, and instructional activities to produce output in the English language. The research is of benefit to educators, and the HCI and UX community that is focused on the design or implementation of conversational experiences with IPAs in language learning.},

Conditions associated with climate change, such as sea level rise and increasing extreme weather events, can destabilize already vulnerable network and digital infrastructures. While existing infrastructures are in dire need of maintenance, additional infrastructures are simultaneously being built to address imbalances in network access and distribution. My dissertation project attends to these intersecting precarities as a way to reconsider how digital infrastructures can be reworked to address overlapping questions of environmental and digital inequities. My research is situated within marginalized coastal communities in south Louisiana, where legacies of petrochemical extraction has led to deep socioeconomic and ecological disparities, while increased intensity of storms and floods have begun to impede and damage an already sparse network infrastructure. In my project, I use archival, ethnographic, and design research methods to examine longer histories of environmental degradation, investigate current practices of maintaining and developing network infrastructures, and develop approaches for researchers in HCI and related computing fields to re-envision just and equitable network infrastructures.},

abstract = {In an ever increasingly complex technological landscape, interaction methods need to support users in their own discovery. This is exacerbated by a general aversion to instruction manuals and a trend towards invisible controls. Consequently, a lack of support for awareness or recognition of interaction possibilities leads to inefficient usage or complete disregard of the system. However, despite standard work imploring that users should be able to “figure out what actions are possible and where and how to perform them”, this problem is rarely considered in the introduction of new interaction methods. My doctoral research is focused on improving the discovery of interaction possibilities. To do so I am combining a theoretical approach, focused on identifying, defining and framing relevant considerations with a practical approach to validate those theoretical considerations and identify and formulate actionable improvement methods for researchers and designers. In the process I hope to highlight the importance of discoverability to the research community and advocate for its increased consideration.},

abstract = {Increasing availability of personal data opened new possibilities for technologies that support individuals’ reflection, increase their self-awareness, and inform their future choices. Personal informatics, chiefly concerned with investigating individuals’ engagement with personal data, has become an area of active research within Human-Computer Interaction. However, more recent research has argued that personal informatics solutions often place high demands on individuals and require knowledge, skills, and time for engaging with personal data. New advances in Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can help to reduce the cognitive burden of personal informatics and identify meaningful trends using analytical engines. Furthermore, introducing ML and AI can enable systems that provide more direct support for action, for example through predictions and recommendations. However, there are many open questions as to the design of personal informatics technologies that incorporate ML and AI. In this workshop, we will bring together an interdisciplinary group of researchers in personal informatics, ML, and AI to outline the design space for intelligent personal informatics solutions and develop an agenda for future research in this area.},

abstract = {Misinformation and disinformation are proliferating in societies compromising our ability to make informed decisions. Currently a myriad of tools, technologies, and interventions are designed to aid users in making informed decisions when they encounter content of dubious credibility. However, with the advancement of technology, new forms of fake media are emerging such as deepfakes and cheapfakes containing synthetic images, videos, and audio. Combating these new forms of fake media requires tools and interventions understanding the new context. In this case, designers and developers of these tools need to examine user experience and perspectives on new contexts and understand multidisciplinary view points before designing any tools. This workshop calls for multidisciplinary participation to interrogate the current landscape of misinformation tools and to work towards understanding nuances of user experience of these new fake media and perceptions of tools that support users to distinguish credible from inaccurate content. This workshop intends to solicit a human-centric design framework which can act as a UX design guideline when designing and developing tools for combating mis/disinformation.},

This paper presents a case study of a one-week deployment of a shared, anonymous heart rate variability (HRV) data visualization system at six workplaces with 24 office workers, who were closely collaborated in four-person groups. We collected stress-related physiology data (i.e., heart-rate variability) from wearable sensors and anonymously visualized them on a shared display. Although the physiological data collection where noisy due to the practical constraints in the field settings, we found the participants still increasingly agreed with the systems and used the visualization as a reference for their subjective stress assessment. We also present and discuss how groups of office workers individually and socially reflect on their one-week experiences and then summarize takeaways for designing shared physiological data visualization systems for group stress management in the long term.},

abstract = {Perceiving images and drawing are fundamental parts of human life, and thus access to them should be a universal right. However, there is a large breach for people with visual impairments to access diverse graphics, let alone drawing. There are several techniques of tactile graphics, such as swell paper, Braille embossing, and thermoform that help to alleviate this gap. However, in developing countries, the high cost and lack of access make them impractical. In this work, we describe our experience improving access to tactile graphics and drawing in Colombia. We created low-cost, effective and efficient, tactile graphics and drawing techniques that improve on current solutions. These techniques were created from the best practices of two projects adapting pieces from the Colombian art heritage&nbsp;[52, 53] for blind and visually impaired people. They were then applied to a third project: running a virtual tactile drawing club with blind and visually impaired participants in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic. The lessons learned from these experiences are presented in this paper with the hope they can help the community democratize access to tactile graphics.},

Traditionally in-product feedback has focused on metrics such as Net Promoter Score (NPS) [21] and Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) [5] which look to measure customer loyalty or overall product satisfaction. By introducing complementary user experience (UX) metrics that are focused on user outcomes, UX teams have greater insight into measuring the successes or challenges of their users in the context of use. This case study describes and discusses the process employed and the lessons learned while designing and implementing a user-centered in-product feedback system. We specifically call out challenges and opportunities around aligning with business outcomes, navigating current frameworks, unlocking self-serve data to stakeholders, informing strategy, and feeding additional research. In conclusion, we present these learnings as a framework, dubbed BLUE, to help other UX teams create in-product feedback mechanisms.},

abstract = {Multimodal Interfaces (MMIs) supporting the synergistic use of natural modalities like speech and gesture have been conceived as promising for spatial or 3D interactions, e.g., in Virtual, Augmented, and Mixed Reality (XR for short). Yet, the currently prevailing user interfaces are unimodal. Commercially available software platforms like the Unity or Unreal game engines simplify the complexity of developing XR applications through appropriate tool support. They provide ready-to-use device integration, e.g., for 3D controllers or motion tracking, and according interaction techniques such as menus, (3D) point-and-click, or even simple symbolic gestures to rapidly develop unimodal interfaces. A comparable tool support is yet missing for multimodal solutions in this and similar areas. We believe that this hinders user-centered research based on rapid prototyping of MMIs, the identification and formulation of practical design guidelines, the development of killer applications highlighting the power of MMIs, and ultimately a widespread adoption of MMIs. This article investigates potential reasons for the ongoing uncommonness of MMIs. Our case study illustrates and analyzes lessons learned during the development and application of a toolchain that supports rapid development of natural and synergistic MMIs for XR use-cases. We analyze the toolchain in terms of developer usability, development time, and MMI customization. This analysis is based on the knowledge gained in years of research and academic education. Specifically, it reflects on the development of appropriate MMI tools and their application in various demo use-cases, in user-centered research, and in the lab work of a mandatory MMI course of an HCI master’s program. The derived insights highlight successful choices made as well as potential areas for improvement.},

We propose digital security guidelines for products and services which may be used by survivors cohabiting with abusers or using devices which may be under surveillance. We conclude with reflections on whether technology design leads to empowerment: although we cannot overstate the importance of digital security design which is sensitive to the unique vulnerabilities of marginalized people, true empowerment requires a greater commitment to funding accessible housing, mental health support, and advocacy.},

One notable example is playful requests: for example, people ask their CAs personal questions (“What’s your favorite color?”) or joke with them, sometimes at their expense (“Find Nemo”). Failing to recognize playfulness causes user dissatisfaction and abandonment, destroying the precious rapport with the CA. Today, playful CA behavior is achieved through manually curated replies to hard-coded questions. We take a step towards understanding and scaling playfulness by characterizing playful opportunities. To map the problem’s landscape, we draw inspiration from humor theories and analyze real user data. We present a taxonomy of playful requests and explore its prevalence in real Alexa traffic. We hope to inspire new avenues towards more human-like CAs.},

abstract = {Learning about Artificial Intelligence (AI) from a young age can help students become competent citizens able to move through our increasingly digital world with confidence and responsibility. This contribution presents a preliminary investigation in Bulgaria, Greece, Italy, and Romania to understand middle school teachers’ perspective on how to best teach digital competencies for AI. It uses the Will, Skill, Tool model as a theoretical lens, and it aims to inform the design of educational content and online platforms to enable teachers to integrate AI education into their classroom. Through a human-centred design process – including focus groups and a survey – needs and requirements were identified for a supportive online educational platform that aids teachers in AI education. The research results showed a positive attitude towards AI education and high motivation to introduce AI-related content at school, which translates to a positive Will factor. Regarding the Skill factor, teachers seem to have a basic level of digital skills but low AI-related skills. No significant problems emerged regarding the availability of resources, but further research investigating whether the Tool factor is accounted for would be desirable. Based on the results, six design implications for a web-based educational platform on AI have been formulated: (i) provide the required basics; (ii) make it relevant; (iii) make it interactive and collaborative; (iv) keep everyone in the loop; (v) make it accessible; (vi) motivate the user. These implications are further discussed to extend computational thinking frameworks to incorporate AI-related concepts and perspectives.},
