abstract = {In today’s society, where “one size fits all” does not work anymore, people’s requirements for material living became more personalized. Despite the fact that there exist customized services for a variety of commodities, these services are generally expensive and such customization for physical artifacts is not accessible by average users. In this work, we follow the promise of Programmable Filament [21], a novel technique to enable end-users with low-cost Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) 3D printers to equip multi-material printing capabilities at low investment. We discovered that this technique can be applied to mix mechanical properties of two different materials (e.g., tensility) that may affect user’s comfort in 3D printed objects (e.g., personal optimal softness in sports gear) to meet individual needs. We briefly introduce the process to 3D print programmable filaments using consumer-grade 3D printers in various composition ratios and fabricate 3D printed objects using an FDM printer blending multi-materials in the hot end, present a tensile testing experiment on sample objects made of such filaments to show its feasibility in producing new properties, and demonstrate two real-world applications that can be benefited from Programmable Filament utilization. We conclude with the remaining limitations and discussions about two potential structural improvements to improve printability of this filament for deployment.},

We explore how such technologies are incorporated into their daily lives using machine learning models trained on the engagement patterns of over 4,700 BLV people. For mobile navigation apps, we identify user engagement features like the duration of first-time use and engagement with spatial audio callouts that are greatly relevant to predicting user retention. This work contributes a more holistic understanding of important features associated with user retention and strong app usage, as well as insight into the exploration of ambient surroundings as a compelling use case for assistive navigation apps. Finally, we provide design implications to improve the accessibility and usability of audio-based navigation technology.},

abstract = {In recent years, virtual reality (VR) technology has shown promise as a means of delivering rehabilitative care to restore arm function in stroke patients. At the same time, limitations of traditional clinical scales for measuring arm function recovery have led to the more widespread use of kinematic metrics. These metrics quantify useful properties of patients’ movements using motion tracking data captured while the patient performs different types of assessment tasks. Given modern consumer VR systems already collect the data needed to calculate many common kinematic metrics, these systems could eventually be used to both deliver stroke rehabilitation programs and administer kinematic assessments to monitor patients’ recovery. However, it is not yet clear how the properties of VR-based assessment tasks may systematically impact the values of kinematic metrics used to assess arm function post-stroke. To begin addressing this question, we examined the influence of two task properties (movement direction and hand dominance) on a set of 10 kinematic metrics during a discrete reaching task performed by healthy participants using an Oculus Quest 2 VR headset. Our findings indicate that all 10 metrics were significantly impacted by these task properties, confirming that kinematic metrics captured in this context are sensitive to task properties. Our results also provide an initial account of how the metrics were influenced by each task property and highlight needs for future work to further understand the influence of assessment task properties on VR-based kinematic assessments.},

abstract = {Micro-mobility is becoming a more popular means of transportation. However, this increased popularity brings its challenges. In particular, the accident rates for E-Scooter riders increase, which endangers the riders and other road users. In this paper, we explore the idea of augmenting E-Scooters with unimodal warnings to prevent collisions with other road users, which include Augmented Reality (AR) notifications, vibrotactile feedback on the handlebar, and auditory signals in the AR glasses. We conducted an outdoor experiment (N = 13) using an Augmented Reality simulation and compared these types of warnings in terms of reaction time, accident rate, and feeling of safety. Our results indicate that AR and auditory warnings lead to shorter reaction times, have a better perception, and create a better feeling of safety than vibrotactile warnings. Moreover, auditory signals have a higher acceptance by the riders compared to the other two types of warnings.},

However, not much is known about how to best incorporate the essentials of their surroundings for balancing real-world awareness and immersion. To address this gap, we explored 2D and 3D visual cues of the rear-seat space to notify passengers about different real-world tasks (lower armrest, take cup, close window, and hold handle) during a first-person game in VR. Results from our pilot study (n = 19) show that users perceive a lower workload in the task hold handle than all other tasks. They also feel more immersed in VR after completing this task, compared to take cup and close window. Based on our findings, we propose real-world task types, synchronous visual cues, and various input and transition approaches as promising future research directions.},

Using modern dancing as a skill to learn, we compared the user experience when learning from a human training video and an avatar training video, considering both self-avatars (n=8) and gender-matched generic avatars (n=8). Our results indicate that learning from avatars can improve the user experience over learning from a human in a video, providing attentional and motivational benefits. Furthermore, self-avatars make the training more relatable and immersive than generic avatars. We discuss the implications from this preliminary work, highlighting methodological considerations for feedforward learning from avatars and promising future work.},

abstract = {Engaging racially and ethnically diverse participants in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research is critical for creating safe, inclusive, and equitable technology. However, it remains unclear why and how HCI researchers collect study participants’ race and ethnicity. Through a systematic literature analysis of 2016–2021 CHI proceedings and a survey with 15 authors who published in these proceedings, we found that reporting race and ethnicity of participants is uncommon and that HCI researchers are far from consensus on the collection and analysis of this data. Because a majority (&gt;90%) of the articles that report participants’ race and ethnicity are conducted in the United States, we focused our discussion on race and ethnicity accordingly. In future work, we plan to investigate considerations and best practices for collecting and analyzing race and ethnicity data in a global context.},

abstract = {Novel voice enhancements for larynx amputees utilize a variety of wearable interfaces and/or artificial intelligence. However, the problem formulation remains posed as “voice restoration”, which stems from common, but limiting, assumptions about communication as a reliable signal transfer, in which “signal” equals to voice. Yet beyond this signal transfer, the vital part of communication is mutual influence. During conversations people coordinate their movement dynamics, i.e. adjust speech timing, intonation and gestures. By taking this perspective, informed by the newest trends in the cognitive sciences (ecological, enacted, extended cognition) as well as recent studies on human-machine integration, we seek to shed new light on the processes of analysis and evaluation of specific systems for laryngectomees. We propose the integrated framework which enables us to interpret bionic communicative interfaces as parts of distributed cognitive systems that allow for different level of control over interactions. This paper analyses 5 bionic systems, consisting of a laryngectomee supported with i) voice copy, ii) voice conversion, iii) silent speech iv) bionic voice or v) lean-AI interfaces. We demonstrate how using the broader perspective leads to noticing important aspects of communication and informs a more human-centered design and evaluation.CCS CONCEPTS • Human-centered computing → Human computer interaction (HCI) → HCI theory, concepts and models • Human-centered computing → Interaction design → Interaction design theory, concepts and paradigms},

However, there are few human studies on the usability of these tools and how they fit the programming workflow. In this work, we conducted a within-subjects user study with 24 participants to understand how programmers use and perceive Copilot, a LLM-based code generation tool. We found that, while Copilot did not necessarily improve the task completion time or success rate, most participants preferred to use Copilot in daily programming tasks, since Copilot often provided a useful starting point and saved the effort of searching online. However, participants did face difficulties in understanding, editing, and debugging code snippets generated by Copilot, which significantly hindered their task-solving effectiveness. Finally, we highlighted several promising directions for improving the design of Copilot based on our observations and participants’ feedback.},

abstract = {In group decision-making, we can frequently observe that an individual adapts their behavior or belief to fit in with the group’s majority opinion. This phenomenon has been widely observed to exist especially against an objectively correct answer—in face-to-face and online interaction alike. To a lesser extent, studies have investigated the conformity effect in settings based on personal opinions and feelings; thus, in settings where an objectively right or wrong answer does not exist. In such settings, the direction of conformity tends to play a role in whether an individual will conform. While cultural differences in conformity behavior have been observed repeatedly in settings with an objectively correct answer, the role of culture has not been explored yet for settings with subjective topics. Hence, the focus of this study is on how conformity develops across cultures for such cases. We developed an online experiment in which participants needed to reach a positive group consensus on adding a song to a music playlist. After seeing the group members’ ratings, the participants had the opportunity to revise their own. Our findings suggest that the willingness to flip to a positive outcome was far less than to a negative outcome. Overall, conformity behavior was far less pronounced for participants from the United Kingdom compared to participants from India.},

As a result of perception responses, hand gestures show behavioral responses from given stimuli. Mouse usages in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) show hand gestures that individuals perceive information processing. This paper presents an investigation of the correlation between unconscious mouse actions and human cognitive workload. We extracted mouse behaviors from a Robot Operating System (ROS) file-based dataset that user responses are reproducible. We analyzed redundant mouse movements to complete a dual n-back game by solely pressing the left and right buttons. Starting from a hypothesis that unconscious mouse behaviors predict different levels of cognitive loads, we statistically analyzed mouse movements. We also validated mouse behaviors with other modalities in the dataset, including self-questionnaire and eye blinking results. As a result, we found that mouse behaviors that occur unconsciously and human cognitive workload correlate.},

The lack of deliberation in online petitions has influenced other users, deteriorating the platform to a degree that good petitions are seldom generated. Therefore, this study designs interventions that empower users to create deliberative petitions. We conducted user research to observe users’ writing behavior in online petitions and identified causes of non-deliberative petitions. Based on our findings, we propose ThinkWrite, a new interactive app promoting user deliberation. The app includes six main features: a gamified learning process, a writing recommendation system, a guiding interface for self-construction, tailored AI for self-revision, short-cuts for easy archiving of evidence, and a citizen-collaborative page. Finally, the efficacy of the app is demonstrated through user surveys and in-depth interviews.},

How can researchers who have little or no knowledge of systems and infrastructures ensure that their data collection source is reliable and maximally available for accessing and storing data? To answer this question, we surveyed 11 HCI researchers. Using the findings from the survey, we developed Styx++—an easy-to-integrate open-source solution that bundles together existing tools and concepts, providing HCI researchers with a reliable distributed system for their database needs. Styx++ is a hybrid solution involving both the Paxos and Chain Replication Protocol, providing strong consistency and high availability to minimize the risks of single-point failures in a traditional database system setup. Our evaluation of Styx++ against benchmark solutions shows promising results of an increase in reliability without substantial performance degradation.},

Harmful impacts include but are not limited to disparities in quality-of-service, unequal distribution of resources, erasure, stereotyping and misrepresentation of groups and individuals, they might limit people’s agency or affect their well-being. Given that language tasks are often complex, open-ended, and incorporated across a diversity of applications; effectively foreseeing and mitigating such harms has remained an elusive goal. Towards this goal, Natural Language Processing (NLP) literature has only recently started to engage with human-centered perspectives and methods—that are often central to HCI research. In this panel, we bring together researchers with expertise in both NLP and HCI, as well as in issues that pertain to the fairness, transparency, justice, and ethics of computational systems. Our main goals are to explore 1) how to leverage HCI perspectives and methodologies to help foresee potential harms of language technologies and inform their mitigation, 2) synergies between the HCI and the responsible NLP research that can help build common ground, and 3) complement existing efforts to facilitate conversations between the HCI and NLP communities.},

We introduce an educational game Classy Trash Monster (CTM), designed to better educate ML and data dependency to non-major students who learn ML for the first time. The player can easily learn to train a classification model and solve tasks by engaging in simple game activities designed according to an ML pipeline. Simple controls, positive rewards, and clear audiovisual feedback makes game easy to play even for novice players. The playtest result showed that players were able to learn basic ML concepts and how data can impact model results, and that the game made ML feel less difficult and more relevant. However, proper debriefing session seems crucial to prevent misinterpretations that may occur in the learning process.},

abstract = {Consumer neurotechnology is arriving en masse, even while algorithms for user state estimation are being actively defined and developed. Indeed, many consumable wearables are now available that try to estimate cognitive changes from wrist data or body movement. But does this data help people? It’s a critical time to ask how users could be informed by wearable neurotechnology, in a way that would be relevant to their needs and serve their personal well-being. The aim of this SIG is to bring together the key HCI communities needed to address this: personal informatics, digital health and wellbeing, neuroergonomics, and neuroethics.},

abstract = {We present a new approach to visualizing data that is well-suited for personal and casual applications. The idea is to map the data to another dataset that is already familiar to the user, and then rely on their existing knowledge to illustrate relationships in the data. We construct the map by preserving pairwise distances or by maintaining relative values of specific data attributes. This metaphorical mapping is very flexible and allows us to adapt the visualization to its application and target audience. We present several examples where we map data to different domains and representations. This includes mapping data to cat images, encoding research interests with neural style transfer and representing movies as stars in the night sky. Overall, we find that although metaphors are not as accurate as the traditional techniques, they can help design engaging and personalized visualizations.},

The role of emerging technologies in these politics of care is understudied, particularly in the Global South. My research looks at why and how emerging technologies are being introduced into care work in health in India and Kenya, uncovering the implications this has for how care work is done, care workers’ lives, and organizations deploying the technology. Drawing on cases of both harm and opportunity effected by technology, my work offers an empirical understanding of the role of technology in the politics of care work, and the implications this can have for the future of care work amidst a global care crisis.},

My doctoral research contributes to our knowledge of accessibility in computer-supported content creation by studying the context of audio production by people with vision impairments. Through interviews, observations, and content analysis, I develop a comprehensive understanding of how accessibility unfolds during various stages of audio content production for blind audio producers – from learning the tools and practices to developing and exhibiting professional expertise while also pushing back against ableist productivity standards and stereotypes. Critically reflecting upon these insights, I am developing a system to scaffold accessible learning of audio production software in a way that recognizes and leverages the expertise and practices developed by blind audio production trainers. The final phase of my dissertation will evaluate this system with both blind trainers and learners to understand how interactive technologies can promote accessible learning in computer-supported content creation.},

Through my future work, I hope to confirm the validity of these findings and examine the potential for StoryCarnival to support inclusive play in mixed-abilities groups through a large-scale deployment study and field studies.},

This course will explain how to design automation and how to assess its pros and cons in terms of user-related properties such as usability, user experience, acceptance or trust. Examples are taken from industries that have been embedding automation in their systems for a long time (such as aviation, automotive, satellite ground segments …) and interactive hands-on exercises will explain how to "do it right".},

We employ the method of sketching, which traditionally favors visual representations, and consider what it means to ‘sketch’ in other modalities like sound, taste, and touch. Through a series of rapid, playful activities ideating data representations across sensory modalities, we will explore how the affordances of sketching—like intentional ambiguity—might help designers creatively map data to experience. We will also discuss challenges for sensory sketching in remote, collaborative environments and brainstorm suggestions for digital tools. The outcome of this workshop will be a series of exercises and examples that serve as a toolkit for designers, researchers, and data practitioners to incorporate sketching across the senses into their work.},

While the number of justice-orientated works may have increased, new social forces question what is meant by the term justice in social justice initiatives; asking who is included in how justice is defined, what its goals are and how might we measure it. We offer this workshop as an opportunity to: (a) build conceptual and visual ‘mosaics’ of social justice works in HCI to map out the existing landscape; (b) build a supportive community of HCI researchers, practitioners, activists and designers who work with matters of in/justice to share vocabulary, approaches and expertise with likewise individuals; (c) facilitate critical conversations around meaningful justice-orientated action and practice, and how they might relate to wider justice frameworks.},

abstract = {This study considers how well an autoethnographic diary study helps as a method to explore why families might struggle in the application of strong and cohesive cyber security measures within the smart home. Combining two human-computer interaction (HCI) research methods — the relatively unstructured process of autoethnography and the more structured diary study — allowed the first author to reflect on the differences between researchers or experts, and everyday users. Having a physical set of structured diary prompts allowed for a period of “thinking as writing”, enabling reflection upon how having expert knowledge may or may not translate into useful knowledge when dealing with everyday life. This is particularly beneficial in the context of home cyber security use, where first-person narratives have not made up part of the research corpus to date, despite a consistent recognition that users struggle to apply strong cyber security methods in personal contexts. The framing of the autoethnographic diary study contributes a very simple, but extremely powerful, tool for anyone with more knowledge than the average user of any technology, enabling the expert to reflect upon how they themselves have fared when using, understanding and discussing the technology in daily life.},
