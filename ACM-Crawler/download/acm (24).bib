abstract = {Many instant messaging applications offer group chat feature where members can share messages and make voice or video calls with a group of social contacts. We conducted a study to understand how families use group chat and what challenges they face. We found family members develop certain habits in using their family group chat, and their behavior changes when they are separated by distance or during a specific situation such as a conflict. Family members might have challenges to construct meaning from a pile of messages, find a specific message from the past and catch up with the new messages posted in the group. They need more control over when they wish to deliver a message and better ways to share their experiences.},

The practices, challenges, and needs of this group of practitioners are less represented in the HCI literature. We address this gap through an interview study with 19 practitioners from Transports Qu\'{e}bec, a government agency responsible for transportation infrastructures in Qu\'{e}bec, Canada. We found that this group of decision-makers can most benefit from research about data analysis tools and platforms that (1) provide information to support data quality awareness, (2) are interoperable with other tools in the complex workflow of the practitioners, and (3) support intuitive and customizable visual analytics. These implications can also be informative to the design of tools supporting other decision-making tasks and domains.},

Resonant properties change depending on the shape, material, and boundary conditions of the objects, so that our method identifies objects on the basis of differences in resonant properties caused by different inner structure patterns using a machine-learning algorithm. We measured resonant properties as frequency properties using active acoustic sensing. Our method is applicable to 3D-printed objects with a low filling rate while reducing the workload of modeling the inner structure to be used as a tag. To investigate the feasibility of our method, we conducted two experimental evaluations. The results of one showed that our method can identify eight objects with an average classification accuracy of 99.3%.},

abstract = {A musician performing on a digital musical instrument is modeled as a feed-forward communications channel. A variety of statements are made on the mutual information of the signals flowing through the model. For example, data processing can only reduce or retain mutual information, not increase it.It is suggested that instrument designers should consider creating high-fidelity musical instruments that generally avoid discarding information. Noise and many-to-one mappings have a tendency to decrease the mutual information, potentially reducing the fidelity of a digital musical instrument. Also, musicians need to rehearse their performances in order to avoid making noisier gestures.Overall, it is hoped that this paper and other related papers by the authors can show how to quantify information processing in user interfaces for continuous control.},

abstract = {Service robots have yet to occupy niches in domestic environments beyond vacuuming and lawn mowing. This can only happen by providing an alternative experience rather than mimicking and competing with humans, pets and already available appliances. We argue that the robot's hybrid nature on a spectrum between 'thing' and 'being' is a suitable framework to create such a unique experience. More specifically, we argue that hybridity creates ambiguity which affords a wider range of practices to occur, from tool use to social interaction. We evaluate this idea in an online study with 61 participants who rated three robots with rather biomorphic (Pepper), hybrid (Sympartner) or device-like (Relay) appearance. Results show that the hybrid design affords a broader spectrum of use compared to designs inscribing to treat the robot as either possession or social companion. The study offers initial insights on ambiguity-through-hybridity as design strategy to help robots become domestic products.},

abstract = {Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is an emerging topic in Machine Learning (ML) that aims to give humans visibility into how AI systems make decisions. XAI is increasingly important in bringing transparency to fields such as medicine and criminal justice where AI informs high consequence decisions. While many XAI techniques have been proposed, few have been evaluated beyond anecdotal evidence. Our research offers a novel approach to assess how humans interpret AI explanations; we explore this by integrating XAI with Games with a Purpose (GWAP). XAI requires human evaluation at scale, and GWAP can be used for XAI tasks which are presented through rounds of play. This paper outlines the benefits of GWAP for XAI, and demonstrates application through our creation of a multi-player GWAP that focuses on explaining deep learning models trained for image recognition. Through our game, we seek to understand how humans select and interpret explanations used in image recognition systems, and bring empirical evidence on the validity of GWAP designs for XAI.},

In this paper, we present our initial analysis of team communications in a trauma resuscitation setting, where we deployed a digital checklist to support trauma team leaders in guiding patient care. By analyzing speech transcripts, checklist interaction logs, and videos of 15 resuscitations, we identified several tensions that arose from the use of a checklist in a team-based process with multi-step tasks. The tensions included incorrect markings of in-progress tasks as completed, failure to mark completed tasks due to missed communications, failure to record planned tasks, and difficulties in recording dynamic values. From these findings, we discuss design implications for checklist design for dynamic, team-based activities.},

A big part of the challenge is that no suitable mechanism exists to replace traditional intercept surveys in a way that ensures fairness and inclusion. The lack of labelled data has also impacted the training of AI algorithms. That is the lack of labels relevant to the target domains has made it hard to estimate the accuracy of the AI algorithms when they are applied to real world situations. In this paper, we propose a framework for collecting in-the-wild images and demographic labels from ordinary people (e.g., park visitors) that ensures that privacy is integrated at every stage of the data collection process from storage to processing and sharing.},

The Squeeze and Twist devices are wristbands that elicit squeezing and twisting sensations on the skin of the wrist. All of these devices are powered by shape memory alloy actuators, enabling them to be quiet, lightweight and discreet wearable interfaces, unlike their vibrotactile or servo-motor driven counterparts. We investigate the potential for these devices to be used in mediated social touch interactions by conducting preliminary psychometric tests measuring affective response. The Pinch device and Squeeze wristband were found to simulate positive affective touch sensations, particularly in comparison to vibrotactile stimuli.},

To this end IOAIL produced a system of standardised icons for attaching to products and systems to indicate both the presence of AI and to increase the legibility of that AI's attributes. Whilst the process of certification is voluntary it is becoming a mark of trust, enhancing the usability and acceptability of AI-infused products through improved legibility.

abstract = {Deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) individuals face several barriers to communication in the workplace, particularly in small-group meetings with their hearing peers. The impromptu nature of these meetings makes scheduling sign-language interpreting or professional captioning services difficult. Recent advances in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technology could help remove some of these barriers that prevent DHH people from becoming involved in group meetings. However, ASR is still imperfect, and it contains errors in its output text in many real-world conversation settings. My research proposes to investigate whether there are benefits in using ASR technology to aid understanding and communication among DHH and hearing individuals. My dissertation research will evaluate the effectiveness of using ASR in small group meetings (through empirical studies with DHH and hearing participants), as well as develop guidelines for system design to encourage hearing participants to communicate and speak more clearly.},

abstract = {Threats to online safety continue to be an extensive problem for social media users. In particular, women and the LGBTQ+ community are often disproportionately affected by severe forms of threats that could transfer to risks to their physical safety. However, safety tools and platform policies often assume users are more homogeneous which may not acknowledge the varying needs of vulnerable populations affected by social oppression. This problem is exacerbated in small closely-knit communities like the Caribbean where it may be difficult to recover from or avoid abusers. Although legislation for online safety exists, they are enforced in few countries throughout the region, and there are few cases of victims being heard in court. My dissertation work attempts to address this problem by developing a holistic understanding of how to design safety tools that acknowledge cultural differences, legislative constraints, and social oppression for vulnerable groups.},

Therefore, it is very important for them to maintain their physical prowess by encouraging the performance of physical activity. Previous research has focused primarily on physical activity as a single task without consideration of numerous additional coinciding events that almost always co-occur. The most common concomitant, secondary task (i.e., dual-task) is related to the cognitive requirements associated with daily activity pursuits. Thus, any procedure designed to promote greater physical activity should include complex tasks. In addition, the older population is diverse, and therefore, physical activity should be personalized according to individual capabilities and skills. We intend to combine navigation as a secondary task to walking, as a task "instructor", guiding the users through their personalized routes and also provide an added value of doing physical activity outside the home.},

We present FoodFab, a system that allows users to control their food intake through modifying a food's internal structure via two 3D printing parameters: infill pattern and infill density. In two experiments with a total of 30 participants, we studied the effect of these parameters on users' chewing time that is known to affect people's feeling of satiety. Our results show that we can indeed modify the chewing time by varying infill pattern and density, and thus control perceived satiety. Based on the results, we propose two computational models and integrate them into a user interface that simplifies the creation of personalized food structures.},

One way to motivate people eating healthy is using gamification, i.e. using game elements in a non-game context. Often, a static set of gamification elements is used. However, research suggests that the motivational impact of gamification elements differs substantially across users, demanding personalized approaches. In this paper, we contribute to this by investigating the perception of frequently used gamification elements in the healthy eating domain and correlations to Hexad user types in an online study (N=237). To do so, we created storyboards illustrating these gamification elements and show their comprehensibility in a lab study (N=8). Our results validate and extend previous research in the healthy eating domain, underline the need for personalization and could be used to inform the design of gamified systems for healthy eating.},

While proposals have been put forth for hardening patterns, such as increasing the number of or changing the location of contact points, none of these proposals has been implemented in the decade-plus since the interface's launch. We propose a new approach; instead of increasing the individual complexity, users select two sequential Android patterns, so called Double Patterns, that are visually super imposed on one another. This allows more complexity without dramatically changing the interface. We report on our preliminary findings of a large user study (n=634) of Double Patterns, finding strong evidence that the scheme is highly usable and increases the complexity of user choice.},

To provide detachable constraints on the tube for bending, we developed a novel technique with a hook-and-loop fastener attached on the tube. We also designed software to convert 3D targeted object shape to the bending pattern of the tube. Furthermore, we implemented a prototype of a machine for the automation of the attaching process of the fastener on the tube.

However, viewing this information through a smartphone's screen is not ideal, as it can cause users to become inattentive to their surroundings. AR head-mounted displays (HMD) have the potential to overcome this issue by integrating navigational information into the user's field of view (FOV). While work has explored the design of turn-by-turn egocentric AR navigation interfaces, little work has explored the design of exocentric interfaces, which provide the user with an overview of their desired route. In response to this, we examined the impact of three different exocentric AR map displays on pedestrian navigation performance and user experience. Our work highlights pedestrian safety concerns and provides design implications for future AR HMD pedestrian navigation interfaces.},

abstract = {Social Virtual Reality (VR) invites multiple users to "interact" in a shared immersive environment, which creates new opportunities for remote communication, and can potentially be a new tool for remote medical consultations. Using knee osteoarthritis consultation as a use case, this paper presents a social VR clinic that allows patients to consult a nurse represented as a virtual avatar with head, upper body and hands visible. We started with an ethnographic study at a hospital with three medical professionals and observed three patient consultation sessions to map the patient treatment journey (PTJ) and distill design requirements for social VR consultation. Based on the results of the study, we designed and implemented a social VR clinic to meet the identified requirements. Our work expands on the potential of social VR to help reshape patient treatment by reducing the workload of medical staff and the travel time of patients. In the future, we plan to conduct user studies to compare face-to-face (F2F) with social VR consultations.},

abstract = {Time and its lack of play a central role in our everyday lives. Despite increasing productivity, many people experience "time stress" exhaustion and longing for time affluence, and at the same time, a fear of not being busy enough. All this leads to a neglect of natural time, especially the patterns and rhythms created by physiological processes, subsumed under the heading of chronobiology. The present paper presents and evaluates a calendar application, which uses chronobiological knowledge to support people's planning activities. Participants found our calendar to be interesting and engaging. It especially made them think more about their bodies and appropriate times for particular activities. All in all, it supported participants in negotiating external demands and personal health and wellbeing. This shows that technology does not necessarily has to be neutral or even further current (mal-)practices. Our calendar cares about changing perspectives and thus about enhancing users' wellbeing.},

However, they lack a compelling representation of the remote user in the local space. We present VROOM (Virtual Robot Overlay for Online Meetings), a two-way system for exploring how to improve the social experience of robotic telepresence. For the local user, an augmented-reality (AR) interface shows a life-size avatar of the remote user overlaid on a telepresence robot. For the remote user, a head-mounted virtual-reality (VR) interface presents an immersive 360° view of the local space with mobile autonomy. The VR system tracks the remote user's head pose and hand movements, which are applied to an avatar. This provides the remote user with an identifiable self-embodiment and allows the local user to see the remote user's head direction and arm gestures.},

abstract = {Rigorous blood glucose management is vital for individuals with diabetes to prevent states of too low blood glucose (hypoglycemia). While there are continuous glucose monitors available, they are expensive and not available for many patients. Related work suggests a correlation between the blood glucose level and physiological measures, such as heart rate variability. We therefore propose a machine learning model to detect hypoglycemia on basis of data from smartwatch sensors gathered in a proof-of-concept study. In further work, we want to integrate our model in wearables and warn individuals with diabetes of possible hypoglycemia. However, presenting just the detection output alone might be confusing to a patient especially if it is a false positive result. We thus use SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values for feature attribution and a method for subsequently explaining the model decision in a comprehensible way on smartwatches.},

abstract = {In recent years, in-mold electronics (IME) technique was introduced as a combination of printing electrically functional materials and vacuum plastic forming. IME has gained significant attention across various industries since it enables various electrical functionalities on a wide range of 3D geometries. Although IME shows great application potentials, hardships still exist during design for the manufacturing stage. For example, printed 2D structures experience mechanical bending and stretching during vacuum forming. This results in challenges for designers to ensure precise circuit-to-3D mold registration or to prevent over deformation of circuit and attached components. To this end, we propose a software toolkit that provides real time 2D-to-3D mapping, guided structural and electrical circuit design with interactive user interface. We present a novel software-guided IME process that leads to fully functional 3D electronic structures with printed conductive traces and assembled surface-mount components.},

abstract = {Spatial clustering can reduce visual clutter on maps and facilitate pattern recognition. However, interactive map exploration needs the spatial clustering to be a dynamic generation and representation process. Users may change derivative representations of clusters during the exploration process. To address this issue, we present ClusterLens, a new interaction technique that brings a focus+context approach into multi-resolution spatial clustering process. A lens is laid on a base map to avoid occlusion with the original and actual point locations. The lens can aggregate the data points at various spatial resolutions as map zoom level changes. We propose three primitives of resolution for spatial clustering: heatmap, circle, and grid, to generate and represent clusters in a separate mapping system. The lens and the base map are linked at all times. We also incorporate coordinated views into the ClusterLens system to facilitate context switching and comparison. We discuss the applicability of our technique and present a use case where ClusterLens can be useful to explore data distributions and reveal spatial patterns.},

abstract = {What for and how will we design children's technologies in the transhumanism age, and what stance will we take as designers? This paper aims to answer this question with 13 fictional abstracts from sixteen authors of different countries, institutions and disciplines. Transhumanist thinking envisions enhancing human body and mind by blending human biology with technological augmentations. Fundamentally, it seeks to improve the human species, yet the impacts of such movement are unknown and the implications on children's lives and technologies were not explored deeply. In an age, where technologies such as under-skin chips or brain-machine interfaces can clearly be defined as transhumanist, our aim is to reveal probable pitfalls and benefits of those technologies on children's lives by using the power of design fiction. Thus, main contribution of this paper is to create diverse presentation of provocative research ideas that will foster the discussion on the transhumanist technologies impacting the lives of children in the future.},

We next designed and fabricated a circular string by appending restriction enzymes and backbone genes. We developed specific bio-protocols to insert the fabricated molecule inside Komagataeibacter rhaeticus bacteria. The transformed bacteria were presented in an exhibition as a sculpture - Semina Aeternitatis, containing billions of copies of the original stories that people could see, touch, smell and taste. Our work is a first step towards a future where the interaction with our past will go beyond words, and take a more tangible format.},

abstract = {While the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) field widely recognises the need for interdisciplinarity, academic traditions from older fields still limit the scope of cross-disciplinary discourse. As HCI scholars come from a variety of backgrounds, developing new HCI-specific research agendas requires a deep immersion in a cross-disciplinary discussion and a thorough understanding of those with a different academic upbringing. This may be difficult in the eventful life of an HCI academic. In this paper, we propose a twelve-step programme that helps foster a better cross-disciplinary discourse. Having successfully survived a multitude of intense arguments between a computer scientist and a psychologist, we offer an easy way to have fruitful and civilised cross-disciplinary discussions. Our programme is designed to help HCI academics broaden their mind and interface with other disciplines while preserving their sanity.},

To develop BRAVEMIND-MST we engaged in an iterative participatory design process with psychologists, engineers, and artists. This first-person account of our collaborative development process focuses on three key areas (1) VR Environment, (2) User-Avatar State, and (3) Events, while detailing the challenges we encountered and lessons learned. This process culminated in eight design guidelines as a first-step in defining a VRET domain transfer methodology.},
