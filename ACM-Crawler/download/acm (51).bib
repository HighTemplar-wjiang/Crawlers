abstract = {This study investigated whether weight illusions in virtual reality (VR) without haptic feedback occur as in the real world. In the experiment, we set up three scenarios to cause three different weight illusions in VR: the size–weight illusion (smaller objects look lighter but feel heavier than larger ones), brightness–weight illusion (brighter objects look lighter but feel heavier than darker ones), and material–weight illusion (lighter-looking materials, such as wood, look lighter but feel heavier than heavier-looking materials, such as metal). The experimental results indicated that the weight perceptions of the brightness–weight and material–weight illusions in VR were opposite to those in the real world. However, the weight perception of the size–weight illusion in VR was the same as in the real world. This study demonstrates how weight illusions occur in VR without haptic feedback, and classifies weight perceptions and the robustness of the illusions.},

abstract = {This paper explores the possibility of using self-tracking technologies to promote sustainable food habits. To explore socio-cultural aspects in food practices and to understand the potential role of self-tracking tools in participants’ everyday lives, we designed and deployed a probe kit with seven participants. We found that (1) participants had differing, and at times conflicting, conceptions of what made their diet sustainable; (2) they viewed self-tracking tools as an unobtrusive means to help them achieve a goal–but didn’t report that those goals were ever met; and (3) they expressed strong associations between particular eating behaviors and rituals and/or holidays. Reflecting on the results and the concept of design (in)action, we suggest an alternative way of designing self-tracking tools for self-reflection (i.e., the art of noticing) that might help people draw attention to the impact of their food practices on the environment. We conclude by recommending a shift in focus from traditional and “always-on” self-tracking solutions to everyday practices, holidays, or rituals in which a technological tool could bring more attention to a particular facet of food sustainability.},

Members of the same subgroup prefer to communicate in their native language for efficiency, which increases the coordination cost between subgroups. The current study extends previous HCI literature that explores the effects of machine translation (MT) on crosslingual teamwork. We investigated whether automated keyword tagging would assist people's comprehension of imperfect MT outputs and, therefore, enhance the quality of communication between subgroups. We conducted an online experiment where twenty teams performed a collaborative task. Each team consisted of two native English speakers and two native Mandarin speakers. We provided MT support that enabled participants to read all subgroups’ discussions in English before team meetings, but in two forms: with vs. without automated keyword tagging. We found MT with automated keyword tagging affected people's interaction with the translated materials, but it did not enhance translation comprehensibility in the context of teamwork.},

If it is possible to control the perception of a hand-held object through stimulation to the body, it can be applied to virtual-reality interfaces and controllers, which can be used in a wide range of situations. In the experiment, proprioceptive stimulation was based on the kinesthetic illusion induced by vibratory stimulation of muscle spindles and skin stretch near the joint. Participants were given a context in which they grasped an object and actively moved. They were asked to evaluate the perception of the object and the arm as the phase between movement and stimulation, and the conditions of stimuli were changed. Consequently, it was found that the perception of not only the arm but also the hand-held object could be changed, although there were large individual differences.},

In this late breaking work, we describe our design that incorporates many of the key strategies of the Scratch visual code editor meant to promote engagement and lower hurdles to programming. Novel key elements of the design include: the strategic use of magnets and locally interlocking block edges to ensure only blocks with valid syntax can be connected, the use of telescoping tubing to specify parameter/operand location and allow their expansion for nested expressions and a block-sized-channel grid work surface that provides structure to aid BVI students in navigating and manipulating their programs.},

abstract = {Rapid diagnostic tests are point-of-care medical tests that are used by clinicians and community healthcare workers to get quicker results at a better cost compared to traditional diagnostic tests. Distributing rapid diagnostic tests to people outside of the healthcare industry would significantly improve access to diagnostic testing; however, there are concerns that novices may administer rapid diagnostic tests incorrectly and thus be left with invalid results. In response to this concern, we propose RDTCheck&nbsp;— a mobile application that guides users through the instructions of Quidel’s QuickVue Influenza A+B test and ensures adherence to the procedure using computer vision. RDTCheck provides users with real-time feedback so that they may either correct their mistakes or re-administer their test. In this work, we conducted findings from a pilot study that demonstrates how well RDTCheck is able to detect common mistakes and successes during the various steps of the QuickVue test. For the 7 participants we recruited, RDTCheck had an average success rate of 91.1% at giving the correct feedback during the RDT administration procedure.},

Digital game design and playful interactions to counter oppression can be leveraged to create digital games that function as counterspaces for BIWOC STEM students to playfully cultivate their belonging and persistence. Our exploratory game design research aims to co-design counterspaces games with BIWOC STEM students, and here we present our initial focus group designs centered on exploring existing BIWOC counterspace practices, preliminary data and insights, and promising directions for developing game design strategies to support BIWOC belonging and persistence in STEM.},

We examine whether incorporating the direction of sound in the audio can support the remote attendees to recognize more clearly who is speaking in the meeting room and eventually improve the experience of attending a hybrid meeting. We present the results of a user study, in which 42 participants followed six different discussions recorded in a meeting room, in six conditions: three audio formats are examined, once in a situation where the co-located conferees wore a face-mask and once without a mask. The results demonstrate that the binaural audio can support remote participation, especially in terms of general comprehension and confidence of comprehension, with higher effect for the face-mask conditions.},

Yet, we do not know the strategies mentors use to advise professionals navigating emerging fields. Knowing these strategies would allow us to create technologies for more effective career mentoring. This paper presents an expert model of career mentoring for novice social entrepreneurs. To build the model, we conducted a retrospective cognitive task analysis with 9 mentors who have at least 5 years of experience advising novice social entrepreneurs. We found that mentors help novice social entrepreneurs regulate career-related stress and make decisions about next career steps. Our findings suggest that further exploration of career mentoring strategies might allow designers to develop technologies based on the expert model, such as intelligent agents, to support and scale mentorship in emerging fields.},

Findings and insights from this exploratory human-centered design approach suggest that it is imperative to conduct further research in HCI fields on (1) tools and technology features that support prospective memory, (2) measurements that assess the effect of using these kinds of tools, and (3) longitudinal perspectives for assessing self-determination outcomes in everyday interactions.},

We followed a Research through Design approach to explore the influence of the seasons on people's PA fluctuations. We were inspired by professional athletes’ seasonal training plan approach, and conceptualized Seasons, a PA self-management tool. We used the tool to gather PA maintenance and fluctuation coping strategies from 10 participants. Our results show that experiencing PA fluctuations is commonplace, especially due to weather conditions, as well as unexpected circumstances. Individuals deploy different strategies to overcome these fluctuations. Our findings lead to recommendations for HCI researchers to consider when designing future PA maintenance tools.},

Typical control systems used, however, rely on a digital on/off control allowing only inflation/deflation at a set rate. This limits the degrees of freedom available when designing haptic experiences. We present an alternative system to allow the use of analog control of the pneumatic waveform profiles to design and experiment with haptic devices, and to determine the optimum wave profile for the desired experience. Using a combination of off-the-shelf components and a user interface, our system allows for rapid experimentation with various pressure levels, and the ability to control waveform profiles in a common format such as attack-sustain-release. In this paper, we demonstrate that by altering the attack and release profiles we can create a more pleasant pulsing sensation on the wrist, and a more continuous sensation for communicating movement around the wrist.},

In an 8-day qualitative diary study, participants reported when they posted on social media, and responded to questions about the type of content they shared, their motivation, and the content’s ideal duration. We discuss our findings about short-term and long-term ephemerality as part of the social media experience, and the potential impact on the evolving identities of teenagers and young adults.},

abstract = {Patients with mild intellectual disabilities (ID) face significant communication barriers when attending primary care consultations. Yet there is a lack of two-way communication aids available to support them in conveying medical symptoms to General Practitioners (GPs). Based on a multi-stakeholder co-design process including GPs, domain experts, people with mild ID and carers, our previous work developed prototype technology to support people with mild ID in GP consultations. This paper discusses the findings of a usability study performed on the resulting prototype. Five experts in ID/usability, four caregivers, and five GPs participated in cognitive and post-task walkthroughs. They found that the application has the potential to increase communication, reduce time constraints, and overcome diagnostic overshadowing. Nevertheless, the participants also identified accessibility barriers relating to: medical imagery; the abstract nature of certain conditions; the use of adaptive questionnaires; and the overloading of information. Potential solutions to overcome these barriers were also discussed.},

abstract = {Home design services employ virtual real estate staging to visually convey proposals to prospective customers, instilling confidence in property owners on how spaces will look once they are furnished. However, creating room-scale visualizations requires days of expert labor to composite products on images provided by the customer. Advances in 3D capture now let users scan their spaces with a smartphone in a matter of minutes, enabling scale-accurate mixed reality experiences that can be leveraged to lower the skill bar and time required to produce visualizations of furniture in the user’s context. We present Home Studio, a web-based tool that lets designers stage any Matterport scan and generate photorealistic renders of products in the user’s context. Our tool enables a drag and drop experience that reconstructs the perspective view of the Matterport scene in a remote service, employing a rendering engine to produce a photorealistic composite.},

This lack of safety precaution occurs in spite of the numerous safety sensors and warning indicators embedded within modern vehicles. This presents a clear need for more effective methods of encouraging consistent seatbelt use. To that end, this work leverages wearable technology and activity recognition techniques to detect when individuals have buckled their seatbelt. To develop such a system, we collected smartwatch data from 26 different users. From this data, we identified trends which inspired the development of novel features. Using these features, we trained models to identify the motion of fastening a seatbelt in real-time. This model serves as the basis for future work in which systems can provide personalized and effective interventions to ensure seatbelt use.},

Whilst popular, many in HCI have critiqued its depictions of ‘the user’ as reductive, shallow, and static. Yet, there are not many alternatives. In this late-breaking work, we present our efforts to imagine and create an alternative to this 2D persona - one that consists of a carefully curated, staged collection of artifacts. We call this an Experiential Persona because it allows designers to interact with and explore the artifacts, individually and as a collection, to imagine and experience the world of ‘the user’. This more embodied, interactive and open-ended persona can potentially support richer sense making; encouraging a more open, emergent, and unfinalized view of people we design for. This study contributes to extending design tools, and exploring novel use of tangible artifacts to support design, as well as a way to represent design knowledge.},

We describe a pedagogical agent that functions in the role of a virtual genetic counselor that discusses hereditary breast cancer risk and motivates women to obtain breast cancer screening. We report the design and evaluation of two prototypes of the virtual counselor. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, and the effectiveness in improving breast cancer genetics knowledge, by adapting the virtual counselor's pedagogical strategies to an individual's comprehension based on dynamic assessments and preferences.},

LightPaintAR allows users to draft, edit, and adjust virtual light traces in AR, and move light sources along the AR traces to generate accurate light traces on photos. With LightPaintAR, users can light paint complex patterns with multiple strokes and colors. We evaluate the effectiveness and the usability of our system with a user study and showcase multiple light paintings created by the users. Further, we discuss future improvements of LightPaintAR.},

We conduct an online survey and collect responses from 232 participants from three different geographic regions (United States, Europe, and India); the participants consist of both adopters and non-adopters of IoT devices. Through data analysis, we determine that there are both similarities and differences in perceptions and concerns between adopters and non-adopters. For example, even though IoT and non-IoT users share similar security and privacy concerns, IoT users are more comfortable using IoT devices in private settings compared to non-IoT users. Furthermore, when comparing users’ attitude and concerns across different geographic regions, we found similarities between participants from the US and Europe, yet participants from India showcased contrasting behavior. For instance, we found that participants from India were more trusting in their government to properly protect consumer data and were more comfortable using IoT devices in a variety of public settings, compared to participants from the US and Europe. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations to reduce users’ concerns in adopting IoT devices, and thereby enhance user trust towards adopting IoT devices.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present electrohydraulic actuators for origami inspired shape-changing interfaces, which are capable of producing sharp hinge-like bends. These compliant actuators generate an immediate hydraulic force upon electrostatic activation without an external fluid supply source, are silent and fast in operation, and can be fabricated with commodity materials. We experimentally investigate the characteristics of these actuators and present application scenarios for actuating existing objects as well as origami folds. In addition, we present a software tool for the design and fabrication of shape-changing interfaces using these electrohydraulic actuators. We also discuss how this work opens avenues for other possible applications in Human Computer Interaction (HCI).},

abstract = {Augmented Reality (AR) has the potential to revolutionize our workspaces, since it considerably extends the limits of current displays while keeping users aware of their collaborators and surroundings. Collective activities like brainstorming and sensemaking often use space for arranging documents and information and thus will likely benefit from AR-enhanced offices. Until now, there has been very little research on how the physical surroundings might affect virtual content placement for collaborative sensemaking. We therefore conducted an initial study with eight participants in which we compared two different room settings for collaborative image categorization regarding content placement, spatiality, and layout. We found that participants tend to utilize the room’s vertical surfaces as well as the room’s furniture, particularly through edges and gaps, for placement and organization. We also identified three different spatial layout patterns (panoramic-strip, semi-cylindrical layout, furniture-based distribution) and observed the usage of temporary storage spaces specifically for collaboration.},

abstract = {Live performance provides a good example of enthusiastic interaction between people gathered together in a large group and one or more performers. In this research, we focused on elucidating the mechanism of such enthusiastic group interaction (collective effervescence) and how technology can contribute to its enhancement. We propose a support system for co-experience and physical co-actions among participants to enhance enthusiastic interaction between performers and audiences during live performances. This system focuses on a physical synchronization between the performer and the audience as the key that generates enthusiastic interaction during a live performance. Also, it supports enhanced bidirectional communication of the performer's actions and the audience's cheering behaviors. An experiment in an actual live performance environment in which collective effervescence was already occurring demonstrated that the bidirectional communication and visualization of physical movements in the proposed system contributed to the further unification of the group.},

The results highlighted the need for a support system to inform on location and proximity of surrounding vehicles. A set of tactile cues for TactiHelm conveying proximity and directions of the collisions were designed and evaluated. The results show that participants could correctly identify proximity up to 91% and directions up to 85% when tactile cues were delivered on the head, making TactiHelm a suitable device for notifications when cycling.},

Telepresence robots enable rich communication and agency through their physical presence and controllability, but their screen-oriented designs and button-centric controls abstract users away from their own physicality. In this demonstration, we present a telepresence system for remotely controlling a social robot using a smartphone’s motion sensors. Users can select between a first-person perspective from the robot’s internal camera or a third-person perspective showing the robot’s whole body. Users can also record their movements for later playback. This system has applications as an embodied remote communication platform and for crowdsourcing demonstrations of user-crafted robot movements.},

abstract = {Consumer electronics are increasingly using traditional materials to allow technology to better blend into everyday environments. Specifically, transmissive materials enable emissive displays to disappear when turned off, and appear when turned on. However, covering displays with textile meshes, veneer, one-way mirrors, or translucent plastics greatly limit the display brightness of typical graphical displays. In this work, we leverage a parallel rendering technique to enable ultrabright graphics that can pass through transmissive materials. While previous work has shown interactive hidden displays, our approach unlocks expressive interfaces with practical end-to-end software and low-cost hardware implementation on mass-produced passive OLED displays. We developed a set of interactive prototypes with touch-sensing that can blend into traditional aesthetics due to the ability to provide user interfaces through wood, textile, plastic and mirrored surfaces.},

A camera in the virtual environment operates as a video feed to the teleconferencing software. An interface resembling a tablet mirrors the teleconferencing window inside the virtual environment, thus enabling the participant in the VR environment to see the webcam participants in real-time.

abstract = {While designing an HCI experiment, planning the sample size with a priori power analysis is often skipped due to the lack of reference effect sizes. On the one hand, it can lead to a false-negative result, missing the effect that is present in the population. On the other hand, it poses a risk of spending more resources if the number of participants is too high. In this work, I present the reference for small, medium, and large effect sizes for typing experiments based on a meta-analysis of well-cited papers from CHI conference. This effect size ruler can be used to conduct a priori power analysis or assess the magnitude of the found effect.

The user can indicate his/her preferred or disliked position and sensor numbers and the proposed optimization evaluates which position or positions combination can generate best accuracy under user’s preference. With the experiment, the proposed scheme can be employed to discover the optimal position to help the HAR system in a simple and customized way.},

abstract = {Thermal comfort is an important factor in building control, affecting occupant health, satisfaction, and productivity. Building management systems in commercial spaces commonly operate on predefined temperature setpoints and control strategies. Many systems target aggregated cohort comfort and neglect to consider the individual occupant’s thermal preferences, leading to high dissatisfaction rates. While recent studies focus on personalized comfort models, such systems mainly operate on occupant preference prediction and do not investigate the reasons for discomfort. This paper presents TREATI’s human-in-the-loop decision-making process. TREATI is a framework that targets thermal comfort conflict resolution in shared spaces using rationale management techniques while considering both individual and cohort comfort. TREATI uses several levels of abstraction separating device management, event processing, context, and rationale management. This separation allows users to adapt the framework to existing building management systems to provide fair decision-making.},
