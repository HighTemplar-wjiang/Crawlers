abstract = {The competitiveness of the video game market has increased the need for understanding players. We generate player personas from survey data of 15,402 players' 195,158 stated game preferences from 130,495 game titles using the methodology of automatic persona generation. Our purpose is to demonstrate the potential of data-driven personas for segmenting players by their game preferences. The resulting prototype personas provide potential value for game marketing purposes, e.g., targeting gamers with social media advertising, although they can also be used for understanding demographic variation among various game preference patterns.},

abstract = {Prior work has explored improving the efficacy of exergames through participatory design with children. Children are not necessarily able to make informed decisions about their fitness, so their perspectives form only half the picture. Adults who are invested in the problem of children's fitness (e.g., PE teachers) are a valuable missing perspective. As a first step to understanding what we can learn from these stakeholders to aid the design of exergames, we conducted one in-depth interview with a PE teacher and several focus groups with children. Our findings showed that, although both children and the PE teacher like similar game elements, children viewed the elements through the lens of fun while the PE teacher viewed the elements through the lens of effectiveness. Our preliminary findings establish the importance of including such stakeholders in the formative design of exergames.},

HCI has equal potential to find solutions for environmental challenges and script, by design, the behavioral changes needed for sustainable net futures. We explore this dichotomy through the lens of data transmission, examining the energy consumption and environmental impact of web communications. This work begins with a critical revisiting of legacy web design that mines the past for actionable ideas towards sustainable net futures. We query how we can reduce our own net energy consumption, and plot a path to design our low-power website. In addition we speculate on a redesign of the background systems, outlining the practical steps we have taken towards solar, wind, gravity and micro-hydro low-power web hosting solutions.},

abstract = {Eye movement recording has been extensively used in HCI and offers the possibility to understand how information is perceived and processed by users. Hardware developments provide the ubiquitous accessibility of eye recording, allowing eye movements to enter common usage as a control modality. Recent A.I. developments provide powerful computational means to make predictions about the user. However, the connection between eye movements and cognitive state has been largely under-exploited in HCI. Despite the rich literature in psychology, a deeper understanding of its usability in practice is still required. This EMICS SIG will provide an opportunity to discuss possible application scenarios and HCI interfaces to infer users' mental state from eye movements. It will bring together researchers across disciplines with the goal of expanding shared knowledge, discussing innovative research directions and methods, fostering future collaborations around the use of eye movements as an interface to cognitive state, and providing a solid foundation for an EMICS workshop at CHI 2021.},

Second, this workshop is intended to further build the CUI community with these challenges in mind, whilst also growing CUI research presence at CHI. In particular, the workshop will survey and map topics such as: interaction design for text and voice-based CUI; the interplay between engineering efforts such as in Natural language Processing (NLP) and the design of CUI; practical CUI applications (e.g. human-robot interaction, public spaces, hands-free and wearables); and social, contextual, and cultural aspects of CUI design (e.g. ethics, privacy, trust, information exploration, persuasion, well-being, or decision-making, marginalized users). By drawing from the diverse interdisciplinary expertise that defines CHI, we are proposing this workshop as a platform on which to build a community that is better equipped to tackle an emerging field that is rapidly-evolving, yet is under-studied --- especially as the commercial advances seem to outpace the scholarly research in this space.},

This has included but is not limited to, work on designing within patriarchal contexts, designing around issues of gender and sexual orientation and designing around literacy. In tandem, local HCI initiatives such as ArabHCI [3] have emerged to address the misrepresentation of these populations in HCI research, highlighting the fact that Western originated design methods would require delicate adaptations to suit non-Western cultural contexts. With the same approach towards inclusivity and co-existence the aim of this workshop is to bring together HCI researchers and practitioners who engage in studies and interventions within Muslim majority communities around the world. The goal is to understand the Muslim identity and perceptions around it, the unique constraints and limitations within Muslim communities and to identify core issues and concerns within these populations. We will explore the following themes: refugees and islamophobia; Muslim feminism and Digital financial services.},

Although there has been a turn to focus on the topic of death by some in HCI we need to go far further to embrace the contexts relating to it more meaningfully and broadly. Through this design focused workshop, we will bring experts and interested parties together to creatively explore opportunities and challenges for HCI at the end of life and beyond. Discussions and design activities will be supported by conceptual resources for design, lived experience accounts, design methods and ethical resources. The workshop will provide a time and place to bring together experts but will also provide an open and accepting environment for those for whom HCI at end of life and beyond is a new area of concern.},

Recently many new Virtual Reality systems with integrated eye-tracking have become available. At the same time, many research labs are using Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) to non-invasively measure brain activity and serve as a brain-computer interface. This course presents timely, relevant information on how Virtual Reality can leverage eye-tracking and brain activity data to optimize the user experience and to alleviate usability issues surrounding many challenges in immersive VEs. The integration of these sensors allows us to determine additional insights into human behavior, including where the viewer is focusing their attention, and monitor cognitive load. Advancing these approaches could make the Virtual Reality experience more comfortable, safe and effective for the user, and open a new world to facilitate new experimentation for Human Computer Interaction (and Brain Computer Interaction) researchers.},

There has been an increasing research effort into creating Machine Learning models able to learn such concepts, in order to distinguish between compatible and incompatible clothes and to select an item that would complete an outfit. However, most of the work done in literature tackles this problem from a pure Machine Learning point of view, disregarding real-case scenarios and the human interaction with systems able to generate outfits. This work tries to move the problem of generating outfits to the Recommender Systems domain by presenting as its main contribution a novel algorithm for a fashion-specific Recommender System that generates fashionable outfits, able to scale its inference time to be useful in real use case scenarios, and applies such algorithm on public and industrial datasets. In addition to this, this work shows preliminary results on how this algorithm can be employed in a real scenario and reports as preliminary results the evaluations provided by three professional stylists on the outfits generated by such algorithms.},

abstract = {We propose a visualization design space for representing unquantified uncertainty in percent composition drug checking test results using pie and cake charts during the opioid crisis. The design space generates alternatives for use in a visual drug report design study that may improve decision-making concerning illicit drug use. Currently, communication of drug checking test results does not capture the uncertainty in drug checking tests, leading to poor and potentially harmful decisions. The design alternatives generated by the design space aim to empower people who use drugs with drug sample information and facilitate harm reduction efforts. Our visualizations may apply to other drug checking services and to scenarios where uncertainty visualization researchers wish to notify end users of the presence of unquantified uncertainty in safety-critical decision-making contexts like those found during the opioid crisis.},

In this study, we argue that response times in ratings can be used to gauge the degree or strength of user ratings. We asked users to rate a set of movies while collecting individual response times, confidence levels, and reasons for user ratings. We investigate (1) the possibility of utilizing response time as a way to further distinguish likes and dislikes, and (2) the various factors that affect rating time. We find that response time can be used to distinguish between sure and unsure answers, as well as the mental process users take before rating an item. We believe that our study will be informative to better find user preferences and relations between explicit ratings and implicit data.},

abstract = {Visualizers are usually added into music players to augment the listening experiences of hearing users. However, for the case of most members of the Deaf and Hard of Hearing (DHH) community, they have partial deafness which may give them a "limited" listening experience as compared to their counterparts. In this paper, we present ViTune, a visualizer tool that enhances the musical experiences of the DHH through the use of an on-screen visualizer generating effects alongside music. We observed how members of the DHH community typically experienced music through an initial user study. We then iterated on developing a visualizer prototype where we did multiple usability tests involving at least 15 participants from the DHH community. We observed how they experienced music with the help of our prototype and noticed that certain music features and elements augmented these experiences. Visualization attributes, their matching qualitative descriptions and equivalent subjective attributes were identified with the help of music experts. Also, affects hypothesized to be induced and dissuaded were identified in improving these listening experiences.},

abstract = {This work proposes a combination of embedded computation and marker tracking to provide more robust augmentations for composed objects in Tangible Augmented Reality. By integrating conductive elements into the tangibles' sides, communication between embedded microprocessors is enabled, such that a connected composition can be computed without relying on any marker tracking information. Consequently, the virtual counterparts of the tangibles can be aligned, and this virtual composition can be attached to a single marker as a whole, increasing the tracking robustness towards occlusions and perspective distortions. A technical evaluation shows that this approach provides more robust augmentations if a tangible block in a composition is occluded by at least 50% or perspectively distorted by at least 40 to 50 degrees, depending on the block's size. Additionally, a test with users relying on the use case of a couch configuration tool shows promising results regarding usability and user experience.},

The study employed a 2 (message timing: before vs. after decision) x 3 (message framing: no information vs. negative framing vs. positive framing) between-subjects experiment where participants were told to solve the specific problem with AI in different conditions. The results showed that participants perceived the suggestion of AI more reasonable and accepted it more when the performance is not stated than any information is provided and they perceived the suggestion of AI more reasonable when the message is presented before the decision is made. The theoretical and practical implications are discussed.},

People often regret using their resources unfavorably (i.e., buyers' remorse or impulse buying) or take the pleasure of having something for granted before long (i.e., hedonic adaptation). Given its effects on optimizing positive experiences, positive emotion regulation can be useful for mitigating these issues. The present paper introduces PurPal, a self-administered behavioral intervention technology that enables users to up-regulate their positive emotions in the context of consumption. PurPal provides adaptive questions associated with users' purchase intentions, which stimulate reflection on possible future positive experiences with purchased items. A user study is planned to validate the efficacy of PurPal in a lab setting. The longer-term goal of the current research is to develop behavioral intervention technologies that support users' emotion regulation processes, enhancing their subjective well-being.},

In this paper, we review our work on exploring perceptions of fairness in AI through co-design sessions with children of color in non-affluent neighborhoods of Baltimore City. The design sessions aimed at designing an artificially intelligent librarian for their local branch.

While SSO is designed to make the login process more seamless and convenient, recent social media data breaches may give pause to users by raising security concerns about their online transactions. In particular, users logging into sensitive services, such as dating apps, may feel hesitant to adopt SSO due to perceived potential data leakage to their social networks. We tested this proposition through a user study (N = 364) and found that individual differences in online security perceptions predict the use of SSO for certain sensitive services (e.g., affair apps), but not others (e.g., matchmaking apps). Informed by theory, potential mediators of this relationship (perceived security, ease of sharing, and usability) were also explored, thus shedding light on psychologically salient drivers of SSO adoption.},

abstract = {Experienced programmers are capable of learning new programming languages independently using various available resources, but we lack a comprehensive understanding of which resources they find most valuable in doing so. In this paper, we study how experienced programmers learn Rust, a systems programming language with extensive documentation and example code, an active online community, and descriptive compiler errors. We develop a task that requires learning Rust syntax and comprehending the Rust-specific approach to mutability and ownership. Our results show that users spend 43% of online time viewing example code and that programmers appreciate in-line compiler errors, choosing to refresh, on average, every 30.6 seconds after first discovering this feature. The average time between these refreshes predicted total task time, but individual resource choices did not. Based on our findings we offer design implications for language and IDE developers.},

abstract = {Collaborative coding offers many benefits to students, but there has been little research on evaluating the applications that students use to collaborate on code. In this preliminary work, we ask "are students' needs being met by existing applications for collaborative coding"? A survey was distributed to students and faculty of computer science to determine if students had experience collaborating on programming projects and identify what applications, if any, they used to facilitate their collaborations. Survey respondents were also asked about the strengths and weaknesses of the applications they used. From the 126 student responses and 23 faculty responses representing 31 unique institutions, over 50 applications were mentioned. We manually clustered the applications based on their affordances and used participant responses to identify opportunities for improvement. We found that many students are retrofitting non-coding applications for their programming projects as a workaround to facing the large learning curves that many collaborative coding tools require. Our findings suggest a need for more novice-friendly collaborative tools.},

abstract = {Virtual reality (VR) climbing systems registering physical climbing walls with immersive virtual environments (IVEs) have been a focus of past research. Such systems can provide physical user experiences similar to climbing in (extreme) outdoor environments. While in the real world, climbers can always see their hands and feet, virtual representations of limbs need to be spatially tracked and accurately rendered in VR, which increases system complexity. In this work, we investigated the importance of integrating virtual representations of the climber's hands and/or feet in VR climbing systems. We present a basic solution to track, calibrate and represent the climber's hands and feet, and report the results of a user study, comparing the importance of virtual limb representations in terms of perceived hand and feet movement accuracy, and enjoyability of the VR climbing experience. Our study suggests that the inclusion of feet is more important than having a hand visualization.},

We addressed this challenge through an iterative design process consisting of three phases with different levels of stakeholder involvement, spanning from understanding the context to developing the concept and consolidating the design. We identified a set of design considerations that focused on enriching data collection, improving the accessibility of information, and blending the decision support into the workflow. To demonstrate these insights, we developed the concept of an AI-based OH consultation, called ConsultAI. ConsultAI is a conversational assistant that can provide real-time decision support to OH physicians during clinical interviews. Based on this case study, we discussed stakeholder engagement in the design of IDSTs for OH physicians.},

abstract = {In office environments, workers spend the majority of their workday sitting in a static position behind a desk or around a meeting table. Prolonged sitting time and sedentary behavior have severe negative health effects. Through this explorative study, we studied how different postures can be stimulated during meetings. We designed PositionPeak: three pieces of furniture aimed at composing a 'dynamic meeting room', subtly encouraging participants to avoid static postures. We video-recorded 5 meetings (N=16) and coded the number of position changes per participant. Participants also filled out a pre- and post-questionnaire about their experience. Our findings show that PositionPeak triggers people to adopt a variety of postures. Participants on average experienced a more efficient meeting but reported physical discomfort with some objects. We discuss the influence of PositionPeak on the meetings' social dynamics, the acceptance of new conventions and design recommendations for new meeting facilities.},

During a nine-month period, the author conducted 40 interviews and 2 focus groups. An analysis of data gathered led to two significant initial findings: (1) current discourse on Explainable AI is hindered by a lack of consistent terminology; and (2) there are multiple distinct use cases for Explainable AI, including: debugging models, understanding bias, and building trust. These uses cases assume different user personas, will likely require different explanation strategies, and are not evenly addressed by current XAI tools. This stakeholder research supports a broad characterization of the problem of Explainable AI and can provide important context to inform the design of future capabilities.},

Also, delays in seeking appropriate medical attention and intake of untested local herbs could lead to severe depressive symptoms, suicidal risks, and adversely affect the mental health of clients. Based on our findings, and in collaboration with the stakeholders, we designed "Gwam-Okwu" [Talk to Me]; a culturally-appropriate interactive app that is hyper-localized, safe and secured, and tailored to support communication and collaboration between health workers and clients/relations, personalized self-monitoring, and guided self-learning for the clients.},

In contrast, so-called "implementation intentions" explicitly relate goal-directed behavior to particular situations (e.g., when, where, and how). Studies show that this has a positive effect on goal achievement. This paper explores whether technology can support the transformation of "good" intentions into concrete implementation intentions and their triggering as well as routinization. Specifically, we report three single case studies with a functional prototype. This prototype supported creating implementation intentions, putting them into a calendar, and being reminded through an object representative for the planned activity. Through the prototype, all three participants engaged more in the activities chosen to fulfill the intention. All in all, the notion of supporting individual implementation intentions through technology seems a viable strategy to support behavior change.},

Thus, users have to interact with each device or app which is time-consuming and settings might be overlooked. In this paper, we provide a stepping stone into a multi-device interface for adjusting privacy settings. We present three levels of information detail: 1) sensor name 2), sensor name and information about captured data and 3) detailed information on each collected data type including consequences. Through a pre-study with 15 participants, we found that users prefer the access to detailed information because this offers the best decision support. They also wish for a clear status communication, a possibility for rule-based settings, and delegation options.},

Indeed, eight in ten of our participants believed their favorite font would be their best. Instead, our findings showed that the preferred font was seldom best, and one font did not fit all. Adult readers in our study read better with varying fonts. An average 117 word per minute difference between worst and best typeface, or around 10 additional pages an hour, means font choice is of real-world significance. Our discussion focuses on the challenges of rapidly identifying an individual's optimal font, and the exciting individuation technologies such an advance allows.},

Since travel demand models have been applied in particular for motorized traffic, only little is known about the influence of variables that affect both the choice of trip destination and the route decision in pedestrian and cycling models. In order to create urban spaces that encourage cycling and walking, we propose a VR (Virtual Reality) pedestrian simulator which involves walk-in-place locomotion. Thus, identical conditions are obtained for all subjects which is not feasible in real world field research with naturally varying environmental influences. As a first step, our qualitative and quantitative user study revealed that walking in a VR treadmill felt safest and most intuitive, although walking in it took in return more energy than walking-in-place with VR trackers only.},
