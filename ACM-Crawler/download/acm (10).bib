abstract = {Informal caregivers often struggle in managing to cope with both the stress and the practical demands of the caregiving situation. It has been suggested that digital solutions might be useful to monitor caregivers’ health and well-being, by providing early intervention and support. Given the importance of self-disclosure for psychological health, here we aimed to investigate the potential of employing a social robot for eliciting self-disclosure among informal caregivers over time. We conducted a longitudinal experiment across a five-week period, measuring participants’ disclosure duration (in seconds) and length (in number of words). Our preliminary results show a positive trend where informal caregivers speak for a longer time and share more information in their disclosures to a social robot across the five-week period. These results provide useful evidence supporting the potential deployment of social robots as intervention tools to help provide support for individuals suffering from stress and experiencing challenging life situations.},

abstract = {Constructive data physicalization (i.e. the creation of visualizations by non-experts using physical elements) is a promising research area in a context of rapid democratization of data collection and visualization, driven notably by the quantified-self movement. Despite a prolific body of work developed to explore physicalization as a mean to communicate data to individuals, little is known about how people transform data into physical artefacts. Current research also falls short in studying constructive physicalizations using other sensory modalities than sight or touch. Building on the principles of data edibilization, we propose to use candies as a medium to study constructive data physicalization processes, due to their ability to leverage multiple sensory channels. We conducted a preliminary study (candy workshop) to gain insights into how people make use of various sensory modalities in the construction of data physicalizations. We hope to inspire new research using candies as accessible research material.},

abstract = {Social interactions are multisensory experiences. However, it is not well understood how technology-mediated smell can support social interactions, especially in collaborative tasks. To explore its effect on collaboration, we asked eleven pairs of users to work together on a writing task while wearing an interactive jewellery designed to emit scent in a controlled fashion. In a within-subjects experiment, participants were asked to collaboratively write a story about a standardized visual stimulus while exposed to with scent and without scent conditions. We analyzed video recordings and written stories using a combination of methods from HCI, psychology, sociology, and human communication research. We observed differences in both participants’ communication and creation of insightful stories in the with scent condition. Furthermore, scent helped participants recover from communication breakdown even though they were unaware of it. We discuss the possible implications of our findings and the potential of technology-mediated scent for collaborative activities.},

abstract = {Vocabulary acquisition is a fundamental part of learning a new language. In order to acquire new vocabulary, words with meanings that are unknown to the learner must be added to the language learning process. When searching for material in the target language, it is useful to know how much of a document is made up of currently unknown words. One simple way to estimate the unknown words in a document is to use the frequency of occurrence, which indicates the difficulty of the word. However, this approach can lead to missed unknown words. In this study, we aim to improve the accuracy of unknown word estimation by using reading activity data obtained from smartphone sensors and taking into account the individual learner’s English reading behavior. We apply a novel user interface which allows us to improve estimation through reading behavior, without the use of eye-trackers.},

Today, Human-Computer integration developed into an emerging paradigm, rapidly gaining traction and developing a theoretical basis over a number of recent symposiums and publications. However, as more contributions are made to the establishment of Human-Computer Integration, the more its concepts and principles seem to diverge, such that we now find that each theorist talks about something different when they say “integration”. Building on the 2017 panel, in this panel, we ask “What is the essence of Human-Computer Integration? And what are its implications for the future of HCI?” This panel seeks to facilitate discourse between leading thinkers from diverse backgrounds with the audience to come to a shared vision and mutual understanding of human-computer integration.},

abstract = {Criminologists and sociologists have documented the ways that technologies for community safety can perpetuate structural racism. Among these include policing technologies that encode Black criminality [4] and surveillance technologies which extends the reach of the carceral state [17]. Fortunately prior work in HCI has also investigated how the design of technologies for community safety can resist structural racism by employing strategies that stand as alternatives to traditional policing activities, including story-telling, community-building, and care practices [10, 11, 25, 27]. This body of work amplifies the practices of community organizations and employs their expertise to build safer community. I contribute to this body of research and ask how technologies can empower a layperson in the goal of building safer communities. This is an area of great potential— just as community policing technologies extend the reach of traditional policing, new technologies can be designed to extend the reach of community organizations aiming to dismantle oppressive social structures. Towards this goal, I leverage Transformative Justice (TJ), a community-based approach to addressing violence which asks us to not only examine the ways in which our current systems, structures, and norms perpetuate harm, but to also dismantle and replace those systems so that the conditions that enabled the harm are transformed. In this paper, I describe the current state of research, the principles of TJ, my goals for the PhD, and where I would benefit from further support.},

abstract = {Automated decision systems (ADS) are increasingly used for consequential decision-making. These systems often rely on sophisticated yet opaque machine learning models, which do not allow for understanding how a given decision was arrived at. This is not only problematic from a legal perspective, but non-transparent systems are also prone to yield unfair outcomes because their sanity is challenging to assess and calibrate in the first place—which is particularly worrisome for human decision-subjects. Based on this observation and building upon existing work, I aim to make the following three main contributions through my doctoral thesis: (a) understand how (potential) decision-subjects perceive algorithmic decisions (with varying degrees of transparency of the underlying ADS), as compared to similar decisions made by humans; (b) evaluate different tools for transparent decision-making with respect to their effectiveness in enabling people to appropriately assess the quality and fairness of ADS; and (c) develop human-understandable technical artifacts for fair automated decision-making. Over the course of the first half of my PhD program, I have already addressed substantial pieces of (a) and (c), whereas (b) will be the major focus of the second half.},

Drawing from literature in the fields of human-computer interaction (HCI), gender and development studies, and health informatics, I will critically examine health workers’ experiences and relationships with “intelligent” systems, and engage in the participatory design of technology that might better serve worker needs while strengthening the frontline health ecology overall.},

abstract = {Most literature has already shown that virtual reality, concretely, 360-degrees video can have influence on affective skills in multiple applications from education to medicine. This thesis aims to go one step further, real-time 360-degree video communications. Researchers commonly based their experiments on controlled environments and participants with specific characteristics which reduce the reproducibility and ecological validity of the methodologies. We propose to design a methodology based on questionnaires and the use of biosensors to jointly assess technical and socioemotional features in bidirectional immersive communications. For that, we first present some research questions and then choose the tools, stimuli, and use case to answer them. The use case selected as starting point to validate the methodology is tele-education. This thesis is an invitation to leave the comfort zone and question the usage of methodologies that have been highly proven with previous technologies, but which may as well be insufficient to address the challenges of new communications.},

I have developed two systems, Drafty and Sketchy, that provide evidence of achieving this goal at differing timescales. In Drafty, unpaid contributors voluntarily update a tabular dataset of Computer Science professor profiles at a multi-year timescale. In Sketchy, university students simultaneously sketch and co-inspire each other during voluntary UI/UX sketching activities at a sub-hour timescale. I seek to integrate lessons from both systems to develop a theoretical framework that uses a feedback cycle to provide users with practical random examples from evolving information to motivate new contributions. I will further develop this theoretical framework by extending Drafty to generate insights to automatically attract visitors and create the Virtual Readability Lab (VRL) to help users improve their reading performance through personalized readability tests and deepen our understanding of information design human performance. Both systems will give users the agency to seek randomized insights within a naturalistic setting to motivate continuous contributions to each system’s evolving information.},

abstract = {Extended Reality (AR/VR/MR) technology is becoming increasingly affordable and capable, becoming ever more interwoven with everyday life. HCI research has focused largely on innovation around XR technology, exploring new use cases and interaction techniques, understanding how this technology is used and appropriated etc. However, equally important is the investigation and consideration of risks posed by such advances, specifically in contributing to new vulnerabilities and attack vectors with regards to security, safety, and privacy that are unique to XR. For example perceptual manipulations in VR, such as redirected walking or haptic retargeting, have been developed to enhance interaction, yet subversive use of such techniques has been demonstrated to unlock new harms, such as redirecting the VR user into a collision. This workshop will convene researchers focused on HCI, XR, Safety, Security, and Privacy, with the intention of exploring safety, privacy, and security challenges of XR technology. With an HCI lens, workshop participants will engage in critical assessment of emerging XR technologies and develop an XR research agenda that integrates research on interaction technologies and techniques with safety, security and privacy research.},

abstract = {While disability studies and social justice-oriented research is growing in prominence in HCI, these approaches tend to only bring attention to oppression under a single identity axis (e.g. race-only, gender-only, disability-only, etc). Using a single-axis framework neglects to recognize people’s complex identities and how ableism overlaps with other forms of oppression including classism, racism, sexism, colonialism, among others. As a result, HCI and assistive technology research may not always attend to the complex lived experiences of disabled people. In this one-day workshop, we position disability justice as a framework that centers the needs and expertise of disabled people towards more equitable HCI and assistive technology research. We will discuss harmful biases in existing research and seek to distill strategies for researchers to better support disabled people in the design (and dismantling) of future technologies.},

abstract = {We are now entering the new space age! In 2021, for the first time in history that there is civilian crew in space, demonstrating the next frontier of human space exploration that will not be restricted to highly trained astronauts but will be open to a more general public. However, keeping a human healthy, happy and productive in space is one of the most challenging aspects of current space programs [11]. Thus, there is an emerging opportunity for researchers in HCI to design and research new types of interactive systems and computer interfaces that can support humans living and working in space and elsewhere in the solar system. Last year, SpaceCHI workshop (https://spacechi.media.mit.edu/) at CHI 2021 welcomed over 130 participants from 20 countries around the world to present new ideas and discuss future possibilities for human-computer interaction for space exploration. The SpaceCHI 1.0, for the first time, brought together crossdisciplinary researchers from HCI, aerospace engineering, robotics, biological science, design, art, architecture to envision the future of human space exploration leading the workshop participants and organizers to form a new global community focused on HCI research for space applications. With success from the previous SpaceCHI, we are exploring the exciting opportunity for researchers in HCI to contribute to the great endeavor of space exploration by participating in our workshop.},

How to teach ML and other data-driven approaches in K–12 education has become a focus of intensive research efforts, with many recent advances in technology, pedagogy, and classroom integration. What to teach learners, at what age, and how, are some of the open questions being explored. This study explored children’s interactions with a simple image classification tool, which used only two features to classify images. The results offer a proof-of-concept of how to teach 1) the principles of the ML workflow, and 2) some central ML insights, including image recognition, supervised learning, training data, model, feature, classifying, and accuracy. The results recognize how learning the principles of technology facilitates a shift in the locus of explanation from what oneself does to what the computer does. The results provide examples of how to support children’s developing data agency.},

Currently, computer science courses that cover AI fairness and bias focus on statistical analysis or, on the other hand, attempt to bring in philosophical perspectives that lack actionable takeaways for students. Based on long-standing pedagogical research demonstrating the importance of using tools and visualizations to reinforce student learning, this case study reports on the impacts of using publicly-available visualization tools used in HCI practice as a resource for students examining algorithmic fairness concepts. Through qualitative review and observations of four focus groups, we examined six open-source fairness tools that enable students to visualize, quantify and explore algorithmic biases. The findings of this study provide insights into the benefits, challenges, and opportunities of integrating fairness tools as part of machine learning education.},

abstract = {Prototyping is notoriously difficult to do with machine learning (ML), but recent advances in large language models may lower the barriers to people prototyping with ML, through the use of natural language prompts. This case study reports on the real-world experiences of industry professionals (e.g. designers, program managers, front-end developers) prototyping new ML-powered feature ideas via prompt-based prototyping. Through interviews with eleven practitioners during a three-week sprint and a workshop, we find that prompt-based prototyping reduced barriers of access by substantially broadening who can prototype with ML, sped up the prototyping process, and grounded communication between collaborators. Yet, it also introduced new challenges, such as the need to reverse-engineer prompt designs, source example data, and debug and evaluate prompt effectiveness. Taken together, this case study provides important implications that lay the groundwork toward a new future of prototyping with ML.},

Despite the importance of pain management for cancer patients, cancer pain remains undertreated. With computer technology and especially Virtual Reality offering open endless opportunities for pain management, we must consider how low-cost home-based Virtual Reality for cancer patients can be sensitively designed to provide comfortable, enriching pain management experiences. Working closely with 51 cancer patients, medical and paramedical personnel, we co-designed an intelligent personalized mobile application to first collect ecologically momentary assessment data on symptoms like pain and fatigue and Health-Related Quality of Life and subsequently enhance symptom management of cancer patients at home. Through this paper, we thoroughly explain the screening process and quantitative analysis we run to identify which environments patients would like to receive as a Virtual Reality intervention that can facilitate the design of Virtual Reality interventions for cancer patients.},

abstract = {Interactive applications using ultrasonic phased arrays of transducers (PATs) provide novel opportunities to create 3D displays. They show visual content using levitated particles such as polystyrene beads, thread or fabric, that dynamically change to render volumetric shapes in mid-air. Typically, this technology uses fixed arrays of transducers (e.g., two boards vertically or horizontally aligned) to display interactive content. That is, a fixed system of reference (SoR), defined by the levitation device, and dynamic mid-air content. This demo proposes a novel setup, featuring a dynamic-SoR for the device with the dynamic mid-air content. We do this by combining a PAT-based levitation device mounted onto a two-gimbal mechanism, resulting into a device with a dynamic coordinate system for volumetric animations. We describe our setup and demonstration, which aims to create an intriguing experience, where both the content and the device itself can freely move in 3D space, with the aim of challenging the user's expectations about the content displayed or even the principles enabling it.},

AR glasses have been used in various well-being situations for providing the person with unobtrusive and in-the-moment feedback. Meanwhile, previous studies have shown that the manipulation of soft-bodied ‘fidget’ objects helps people manage emotions and improve focus. This project explores whether combining fidgeting behaviors such as swiping, tapping, and clicking with supportive visual/auditory feedback on AR glasses can support emotion regulation in the moment. We will demonstrate three visual/auditory metaphors in the form of AR lenses (Lotus, Bubble, Fire) combined with suggested target fidget actions based on prior research, toward helping people to regulate anxiety, boredom, and anger.},

Our analysis reveals that the current teaching practices underemphasize design thinking, prototyping, and evaluation skills, while focusing on technical implementation. We recommend VR curricula should emphasize design principles and guidelines, offer training in prototyping and ideation, prioritize practical design exercises while providing industry insights, and encourage students to solve VR design problems beyond the classroom.},

abstract = {Spatially sonified audio is frequently used in virtual environments to serve as an object localization cue. However, spatializers that are available to the general public typically have their limitations and lead to sound localization errors. By combining it with non-spatial sonification, the technique of encoding information with perceptual attributes of the sound, the localization errors of spatially sonified audio could be reduced. However, the encoded information would require higher mental effort to understand, which could be a concern under high task load. In this paper, we conducted a subjective study to compare spatial sonification against combined auditory cue using spatial and non-spatial sonification for target localization. We tested both methods under low and high task load. Our results show that combined sonification could significantly reduce the errors in localizaiton, but the advantage would be influenced by higher task load. Further, we compared several different non-spatial sonification methods for encoding depth information. Our experiment shows that both pitch and pulse frequency modulation are feasible for presenting depth of the target. Our results could contribute as a first step to a general guideline of designing sonification method as target localization cue.},
