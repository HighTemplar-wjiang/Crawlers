abstract = {Hyperscanning is an emerging method for measuring two or more brains simultaneously. This method allows researchers to simultaneously record neural activity from two or more people. While this method has been extensively implemented over the last five years in the real-world to study inter-brain synchrony, there is little work that has been undertaken in the use of hyperscanning in virtual environments. Preliminary research in the area demonstrates that inter-brain synchrony in virtual environments can be achieved in a manner similar to that seen in the real world. The study described in this paper proposes to further research in the area by studying how non-verbal communication cues in social interactions in virtual environments can affect inter-brain synchrony. In particular, we concentrate on the role eye gaze plays in inter-brain synchrony. The aim of this research is to explore how eye gaze affects inter-brain synchrony between users in a collaborative virtual environment.},

abstract = {Mid-air interfaces enable rich 3D interactions and are inherently hygienic, but the technology is not yet ready for real-world public interfaces such as elevators, ATMs, and kiosks – one barrier to their adoption is the limited work on the accessibility of mid-air systems. To this end, we designed an interactive simulation of a contactless elevator simulation with mid-air touch feedback and comprehensive accessibility considerations. Despite being fully contactless, the controls are tactile and closely resemble the mental model of ordinary elevator buttons. Moreover, our demo features 1) mid-air haptics for conveying Braille information, 2) responsive button magnification to assist people with low vision, 3) intuitive gestures for opening or closing doors, and 4) audio feedback. Because many of the ideas and interactions in this demo can apply to other mid-air public interfaces, we hope to inspire more work on improving the accessibility of mid-air interfaces.},

abstract = {With the global COVID-19 pandemic that began in early 2020, it has become difficult to hold workshops that bring people together in one place. Consequently, demand for online events and virtual workshops is increasing so as to minimize the loss of learning opportunities. However, providing an experience of building things remotely is not easy because of the time and cost of preparing materials and equipment, and the difficulties of distance teaching. So, we designed a kinetic toy kit that can be sent in an envelope, be constructed with ease, and work without any batteries. The kinetic toy, constructed using magnetic sheets, cardboard, and paper, allows the users to design and create “animals” with variable motions. At the two online workshops we held for 15 participants from 3 to 11 years old, all of the children enjoyed building toys and some participants invented original mechanisms and new animals. In this paper, we describe the details of the toy kit and the online workshops that used it.},

However, it is still quite rare to find works that aim to straightly control the subjective difficulty perceived by the player. Our research question is whether or not it is possible to control the perceived difficulty just by adding enemy objects that do not raise the actual difficulty level. To investigate this issue, we designed a simple shooting game with two ‘fake enemy bullets’: Unreachable Bullets and Non-collisionable Bullets, which do not damage the player character. The experiment suggests that the non-collisionable bullet can efficiently increase the perceived difficulty level but the unreachable bullet does not. Such a study in novel techniques that can control the perceived difficulty without changing the actual difficulty could contribute to both research and practices in game design.},

Instructors shipped materials and equipment directly to students, converted makerspaces to job-shops, and substituted low-tech construction methods and hobbyist equipment for industrial tools. The experiences of students and instructors during the pandemic highlighted new learning opportunities when making outside the makerspace. Simultaneously, the shutdown raised new questions on the limits of remote learning for digital fabrication, electronics, and manual craft. This panel brings together experts in making to discuss their experiences teaching physical production in art, design, and engineering during the pandemic. Panelists will discuss their teaching strategies, describe what worked and what did not, and argue for how we can best support students learning hands-on skills going forward.},

abstract = {HCI research has for long been dedicated to better and more naturally facilitating information transfer between humans and machines. Unfortunately, humans' most natural form of communication, speech, is also one of the most difficult modalities to be understood by machines – despite, and perhaps, because it is the highest-bandwidth communication channel we possess. While significant research efforts, from engineering, to linguistic, and to cognitive sciences, have been spent on improving machines' ability to understand speech, the CHI community (and the HCI field at large) has only recently started embracing this modality as a central focus of research. This can be attributed in part to the unexpected variations in error rates when processing speech, in contrast with often-unfounded claims of success from industry, but also to the intrinsic difficulty of designing and especially evaluating speech and natural language interfaces. As such, the development of interactive speech-based systems is mostly driven by engineering efforts to improve such systems with respect to largely arbitrary performance metrics. Such developments have often been void of any user-centered design principles or consideration for usability or usefulness in the same ways as graphical user interfaces have benefited from heuristic design guidelines.The goal of this course is to inform the CHI community of the current state of speech and natural language research, to dispel some of the myths surrounding speech-based interaction, as well as to provide an opportunity for researchers and practitioners to learn more about how speech recognition and speech synthesis work, what are their limitations, and how they could be used to enhance current interaction paradigms. Through this, we hope that HCI researchers and practitioners will learn how to combine recent advances in speech processing with user-centred principles in designing more usable and useful speech-based interactive systems.},

abstract = {Web content accessibility is essential for a product to serve a wider range of users and make content accessible for all users under different conditions. However, it is rarely mentioned in ICT industry and also not being widely addressed among most of the companies in China. Advocating for accessibility in an existing complex product poses more challenges and demands more effort. As we think everyone's experience matters and it is imperative to make Alibaba Cloud console more inclusive, we propose a method that making the accessibility adoption process easier for all enterprise scaled products by taking incremental steps. Starting from getting stakeholders onboard with explicit data, our practice includes a way to design an adapted, simplified yet comprehensible version of accessibility design guidelines, which can make the implementation of accessibility more executable in Chinese enterprises, as well as how to design a set of level definition that could help to prioritize tasks based on the user composition of a product. The approach could be a helpful reference for other companies and teams in China.},

In this paper, we will describe a human-centered approach to designing and developing the platform, in particular, the process of incremental improvement in search functionality and search results presentation through usability evaluation. The process involves user research, expert review of design concept, low-fidelity wireframe usability testing, high-fidelity usability evaluation, and collaboration between the government agency and academic institutions.

abstract = {This case study involves: the design and evaluation of serious games; the use of longitudinal research and remote testing in an international setting. Current methods for cognitive assessment tend to be inconvenient, costly and infrequently performed. This is unfortunate because cognitive assessment is an important tool. In the young it can detect atypical development, and in older people it can detect cognitive decline. For both young and old, cognitive assessments can identify problems and trigger interventions for reducing harms (e.g., adverse reactions to drugs) or providing treatment. Serious games for cognitive assessment can potentially be self-administered and played on an on-going basis so as to track cognitive status over time, something that is not practical with current methods. Inspired by this opportunity the BrainTagger team has developed a suite of cognitive assessment games. Studies are being carried out to assess the validity of these games for measuring the cognitive functions that they target, but those studies don't address the issue of whether people will be willing to play the game repeatedly, without supervision, over an extended period of time. Thus we carried out a longitudinal study with BrainTagger. We report on the logistical challenges of running this study with an international team located in Canada and Japan during the COVID19 pandemic. We also report on how the perceived “fun” of games changed over time. Our games were all versions of Whack-a-mole games, with each game requiring a different cognitive function to distinguish between targets (moles to hit) and distractors (moles to avoid). While the basic Whack-a-mole game is fun to play, having to play the same games again and again over a larger time period appeared to be more challenging than anticipated and motivation and acceptance seemed to gradually decrease over the course of the study. We conclude that addition of gamification features, such as leaderboards and in-game rewards, are needed to sustain enjoyment of our BrainTagger games and likely other games as well.},

abstract = {My research is on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) from a User Centered Design (UCD) perspective and values the user’s qualitative assessment of their interaction under the concept of User Experience (UX). Traditionally, UX is retrieved in a written questionnaire as a satisfaction survey, nevertheless, with the hike in electronic devices equipped with a diversity of sensors, actuators and processing capabilities (turning everyday appliances into robots) comes an intention to migrate from qualitative to quantitative assessment of the UX; for example, visual recognition of emotional facial expressions. In this regard, what I present as a novelty in the research area is the study of interaction data generated through the robot’s interface during its intended use (everyday use), while providing an anonymous experience (no cameras, no mics) to the user. For the experimental setup, I designed and built a robotic Desk-Lamp with 5 degrees of freedom (height, brightness, projection angle, sensitivity of the interface and ambient lighting) as test bench, equipped with: an interface instrumented to sense the force delivered by the user while “pushing buttons”; 18 variable data-logging system at 20 SPS (Sample Per Second); high precision and high repeatability electronics and mechanisms; real-time sensing of the user and low-latency operation due to parallel processing. The test bench is designed to be used in multiple experiments with users, varying the robot behavior and interaction procedures to compare the interaction data generated in the interface with a written UX questionnaire.},

abstract = {Presence is the feeling of actually being located in a virtual environment, and has been subject to intensive research as long as virtual reality exists. Nowadays, it is commonly evaluated using subjective measures, which most of the time take the form of questionnaires. However, there have been doubts about whether measures of this type are able to truly capture the actual concept behind presence (if it exists, although this is highly likely). While working on my master’s thesis, I found that it is quite difficult in practice to purposefully employ more objective measures into specific experimental designs. This is why I decided to dedicate myself to contributing ways to make this easier for as many scenarios as possible. My current work involves advanced pattern recognition and general methods from digital signal processing to analyze objective, continuous sensory data like eye-tracking and electromyography.},

These issues still exist in the most current conversational interfaces in the commercial market, like the Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, and Siri. The aim of this workshop therefore is to bring both academics and industry practitioners together to bridge the gaps of knowledge in regards to the tools, practices, and methods used in the design of CUIs. This workshop will bring together both the research performed by academics in the field, and the practical experience and needs from industry practitioners, in order to have deeper discussions about the resources that require more research and development, in order to build better and more usable CUIs.},

In line with the CHI 2021 theme of Making Waves. Combining Strengths, this interactive workshop will invigorate the debates and practices in HCI of decolonization by bringing together and demonstrating how designers and researchers in diverse global contexts are working with and adapting modes, concepts, methodologies and sensibilities into decolonizing design practices.

abstract = {There is an increasing interest in food within the HCI discipline, with many interactive prototypes emerging that augment, extend and challenge the various ways people engage with food, ranging from growing plants, cooking ingredients, serving dishes and eating together. Grounding theory is also emerging that in particular draws from embodied interactions, highlighting the need to consider not only instrumental, but also experiential factors specific to human-food interactions. Considering this, we are provided with an opportunity to extend human-food interactions through knowledge gained from designing novel systems emerging through technical advances. This workshop aims to explore the possibility of bringing practitioners, researchers and theorists together to discuss the future of human-food interaction with a particular highlight on the design of experiential aspects of human-food interactions beyond the instrumental. This workshop extends prior community building efforts in this area and hence explicitly invites submissions concerning the empirically-informed knowledge of how technologies can enrich eating experiences. In doing so, people will benefit not only from new technologies around food, but also incorporate the many rich benefits that are associated with eating, especially when eating with others.},

abstract = {Video games are often about being able to do things that are not possible in real life, about experiencing great adventures and visiting new places. Yet, as prolific as gaming is, it is inaccessible to a significant number of people with neuromuscular diseases who are unable to play games with traditional input methods like game controllers or keyboard and mouse combinations. While primarily used for entertainment in the early days, gaming now provides the possibility of countering social isolation and connecting with others through multiplayer games, online gaming communities and game streaming. In our work, we explore how facial expression recognition can be harnessed to provide quadriplegic individuals a way to play games independently and without complex mouth controller devices. We demonstrate our input interface with the design of a first person shooter game.},

abstract = {While ostensibly meritocratic, our society functions on an imperceptible yet undeniable paradigm of privilege. Privilege is an unearned, unasked for advantage gained because of the way society views an aspect of an individual's identity, such as race, caste, ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic status, and language. Privilege permeates nearly every facet of human existence and yet we seem to barely recognise its role in what are seemingly impartial outcomes. Tread Together is an interactive narrative based game that uses gameplay as a tool to help people better reflect on their own privilege and examine how it affects the people around them using a combination of critical and reflective design. The narrative transports players to embark on a journey through an alternative perspective in the game with the express intent of introspective contemplation and scrutiny of privilege as a dominant paradigm in society.},

abstract = {Women with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) face serious physiological and psychosocial challenges. The management of this chronic, incurable condition requires long-term care coordination. Traditional clinical methods do not often provide adequate and personalized support for these individuals. In this project, we aim to use smart speakers to provide supportive care interventions to improve the quality of life for women with MBC. Specifically, we have developed Nurse AMIE (Addressing Metastatic Individuals Everyday) by leveraging the Amazon Alexa to remotely deliver validated interventions. We believe that voice interactions can significantly lower the barrier to interact with remote intervention technologies for this population. In a pilot study, we deployed Nurse AMIE for 14 days over 6 women with MBC. Based on the collected data, this paper discusses the feasibility, acceptability, and future directions of Nurse AMIE. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to use smart speakers to support women with MBC.},

We present a system for using Twitter that requires users to continuously turn a hand crank to power their social media screen. We evaluate the device and its effects on how users value Twitter with 3 participants over 3 weeks, with the middle week of Twitter usage directed exclusively through our system. Using our device caused a dramatic decrease in Twitter usage for all participants, which either persisted or rebounded in the post-intervention week. Our analysis of diary studies and qualitative interviews surfaced three themes indicating shifting focus on content, shifting awareness about the role of social media, and new social dynamics around content-sharing.},

abstract = {Social media platforms face rampant misinformation spread through multimedia posts shared in highly-personalized contexts [10, 11]. Foundational qualitative research is necessary to ensure platforms’ misinformation interventions are aligned with users’ needs and understanding of information in their own contexts, across platforms. In two studies, we combined in-depth interviews (n=15) with diary and co-design methods (n=23) to investigate how a mix of Americans exposed to misinformation during COVID-19 understand their information environments, including encounters with interventions such as Facebook fact-checking labels. Analysis reveals a deep division in user attitudes about platform labeling interventions, perceived by 7/15 interview participants as biased and punitive. As a result, we argue for the need to better research the unintended consequences of labeling interventions on factual beliefs and attitudes. Alongside these findings, we discuss our methods as a model for continued independent qualitative research on cross-platform user experiences of misinformation in order to inform interventions.},

We found that information is focused on complying with legal regulations, and puts the responsibility for such decisions on the developer. Also, sample code and settings often have privacy-unfriendly defaults laced with dark patterns to nudge developers’ decisions towards privacy-unfriendly options such as sharing sensitive data to increase revenue. We conclude by discussing future research around empowering developers and minimising the negative impacts of dark patterns.},

abstract = {In the last years, researchers and therapists have pinpointed a number of critical aspects in current speech-language interventions. Several studies have explored the use of technology to overcome these barriers and to support speech-therapy in children with language impairments (e.g. DLD and ASD). In this paper, we propose a conceptual framework for designing linguistic activities (for assessment and training), based on advances in psycholinguistics. Moving from this theoretical framework, we identified a development process - from the UX design to coding of activities – which is based on a novel set of Design Patterns at multiple layers of abstraction. We then put this framework into practice by implementing these patterns into two technological solutions – tablet and robots – and performing an empirical study to evaluate their benefits. Our results, although still preliminary since they assessed only a tablet experimental condition, are promising for extending the identified Design Patterns to other technological solutions.},

Yet, people often find it difficult to initiate and maintain conversation due to the lack of information about strangers. Hence, we aimed to facilitate conversation between the strangers with the use of machine learning (ML) algorithms and present BlahBlahBot, an ML-infused chatbot that moderates conversation between strangers with personalized topics. Based on social media posts, BlahBlahBot supports the conversation by suggesting topics that are likely to be of mutual interest between users. A user study with three groups (control, random topic chatbot, and BlahBlahBot; N=18) found the feasibility of BlahBlahBot in increasing both conversation quality and closeness to the partner, along with the factors that led to such increases from the user interview. Overall, our preliminary results imply that an ML-infused conversational agent can be effective for augmenting a dyadic conversation.},

We suggest that the function of few-shot examples in these cases is better described as locating an already learned task rather than meta-learning. This analysis motivates rethinking the role of prompts in controlling and evaluating powerful language models. We discuss methods of prompt programming, emphasizing the usefulness of considering prompts through the lens of natural language. We explore techniques for exploiting the capacity of narratives and cultural anchors to encode nuanced intentions and techniques for encouraging deconstruction of a problem into components before producing a verdict. Informed by this more encompassing theory of prompt programming, we also introduce the idea of a metaprompt that seeds the model to generate its own natural language prompts for a range of tasks. Finally, we discuss how these more general methods of interacting with language models can be incorporated into existing and future benchmarks and practical applications.},
