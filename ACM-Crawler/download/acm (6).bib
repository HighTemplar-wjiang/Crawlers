abstract = {Online shoppers have a lot of information at their disposal when making a purchase decision. They can look at images of the product, read reviews, make comparisons with other products, do research online, read expert reviews, and more. Voice shopping (purchasing items via a Voice assistant such as Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant) is different. Voice introduces novel challenges as the communication channel is limited in terms of the amount of information people can and are willing to absorb. Because of this, the system should choose the single most effective nugget of information to help the customer, and present the information succinctly. In this paper we report on a within-subject user study (N = 24), in which we employed three template-based methods that use information from customer reviews, product attributes and search relevance signals to generate helpful supporting information. Our results suggest that: (1) supporting information from customer reviews significantly improves participants perception of system effectiveness (helping them make good decisions); (2) supporting information based on search relevance signals improves user perception of system transparency (providing insight into how the system works). We discuss the implications of our findings for providing supporting information for customers shopping by Voice.},

abstract = {Although clinical training in implicit bias is essential for healthcare equity, major gaps remain both for effective educational strategies and for tools to help identify implicit bias. To understand the perspectives of clinicians on the design of these needed strategies and tools, we conducted 21 semi-structured interviews with primary care clinicians about their perspectives and design recommendations for tools to improve patient-centered communication and to help mitigate implicit bias. Participants generated three types of solutions to improve communication and raise awareness of implicit bias: digital nudges, guided reflection, and data-driven feedback. Given the nuance of implicit bias communication feedback, these findings illustrate innovative design directions for communication training strategies that clinicians may find acceptable. Improving communication skills through individual feedback designed by clinicians for clinicians has the potential to improve healthcare equity.},

However, there are some technical challenges for people with intellectual disability when accessing required information and interacting with conversational search systems. This paper presents the preliminary development of a simulated multi-modal conversational search system to understand its potentials and limitations for people with intellectual disability. To conduct an exploratory study, we developed a Wizard of Oz conversational multi-modal system which records user activities, including touch, text and verbal interactions. Then, we preliminary evaluated the system with eight adults with intellectual disability in one of two different information-seeking scenarios – in an individual and collaborative setting. Drawing on the findings and insights of the study, participants valued the system as it fulfilled their information retrieval needs, and it achieved an acceptable level of accessibility. These findings and future research into this topic can guide accessibility improvements to current search systems and the development of future conversational search systems.},

abstract = {Increasing adoption of Virtual Reality (VR) systems in various fields has created the need for collaborative work and communication. Today, asymmetric communication between a VR user and other non-VR users remains a challenge. The VR user cannot see the external non-VR users, and the non-VR users are restricted to the VR user’s first-person view. To address this, we propose WebTransceiVR, an asymmetric collaboration toolkit which when integrated into a VR application, allows multiple non-VR users to share the virtual space of the VR user. It allows external users to enter and be part of the VR application’s space through standard web browsers on mobile and computers. These external users can explore and interact with the other users, the VR scene as well as the VR user. WebTransceiVR also includes a cloud-based streaming solution that enables many passive spectators to view the scene through any of the active cameras. We conduct informal user testing to gain additional insights for future work.},

abstract = {Deep conceptualization and reflection of online information is essential to people’s knowledge acquisition and decision-making in high-stakes domains, such as health. Reflective thinking, however, demands extra cognitive efforts, resources and skills, and therefore could deter people from taking further steps to question information encountered online. In this paper, we proposed a digital nudging tool for supporting critical reflection of video contents based on concept mapping and peer commenting mechanisms. The proposed tool, DeepThinkingMap, aims to promote people’s understanding and reflection of video content via interface features that foster the disclosure of personal conceptualization and transparency of personal beliefs about the video. By seeing how peers conceptualize and reflect about the video content, the concepts and comments made available to people could potentially serve as a ”thinking nudge,” allowing individuals to reap in-depth thoughts about the video otherwise inaccessible to them. Through a proof-of-concept controlled evaluation, we found that seeing peer thoughts through DeepThinkingMap significantly increased content comprehension, and fostered greater efforts for reflection in comparison to the baseline of receiving no nudge. The study contributes to understanding the socio-technical-cognitive mechanisms and the design space of social nudging that may be utilized to support reflection and critical thinking toward high-stakes information.},

abstract = {Text summarization is an example of a complex algorithm with a single direct input to output user operation. As different types of users e.g. students, journalists, etc. adopt these algorithms, it is imperative that user experience with text summarization AI systems is modified to allow agency. To explore this, we designed an interactive multi-document summarization system, called Living Documents, that allows agency over the summarization process. We evaluated this system in a preliminary study with 25 students identified from Prolific. The students perform summarization tasks using the control functions in our system. Results from this study show that these functions contributed to the user’s understanding of how summarization works and this understanding slightly impacts user trust in our system positively. We discuss our experience designing for user control of a normally automated, complex process that produces immutable output and the future implications for other applications.},

How could we leverage spatial and temporal memories as mediators among occupants of a shared physical space? We developed Memory Portal, an interactive mirror that reflects the shadows and sounds of past occupants of a shared physical space in the present. We conducted a short user study to explore how the occupants of a shared space perceive the interactions with the reflected memories. One of our key finding is that the occupants formed a novel perspective about their actions and experience in the space through these memories. Our contributions include introducing a novel technical system and new approaches of data engagement in shared physical spaces through the visualization and sonification of memories of the presence of its occupants.},

abstract = {The common layer-by-layer deposition of regular, 3-axis 3D printing simplifies both the fabrication process and the 3D printer’s mechanical design. However, the resulting 3D printed objects have some unfavourable characteristics including visible layers, uneven structural strength and support material. To overcome these, researchers have employed robotic arms and multi-axis CNCs to deposit materials in conformal layers. Conformal deposition improves the quality of the 3D printed parts through support-less printing and curved layer deposition. However, such multi-axis 3D printing is inaccessible to many individuals due to high costs and technical complexities. Furthermore, the limited GUI support for conformal slicers creates an additional barrier for users. To open multi-axis 3D printing up to more makers and researchers, we present a cheap and accessible way to upgrade a regular 3D printer to 5 axes. We have also developed a GUI-based conformal slicer, integrated within a popular CAD package. Together, these deliver an accessible workflow for designing, simulating and creating conformally-printed 3D models.},

Accordingly, we design “Hua'er and the Youth” (HY) that integrates three methods (virtual avatar, participatory performance, and game-based knowledge acquisition) and conduct a between-subjects user study to compare HY with the Comparison system. The results suggest that our methods significantly improved audience's interactive experience, knowledge level and the awareness of ICH safeguarding.},

Unlike other private attributes such as demographic attributes, an intention oftentimes leads to a near-future behavior. Prior knowledge about such future behaviors can be seen as “actionable intelligence” and constitutes a significantly bigger risk to users’ privacy than knowledge of non-behavioral attributes. In this paper, we present a novel, multidisciplinary methodology for behavioral-intention inference. Using Bayesian-Networks, we model a behavioral intention using a set of causes that influence the intention’s formation, a set of effects that are caused by the intention, and various dependency relations within and between those sets. Unlike the methodologies used in prior attribute-inference works, which are oftentimes tailored to a single target attribute, our methods can be applied to different types of intentions from a diverse set of domains as we demonstrate by applying our model to multiple real-world intention-inference tasks.},

To explore needs and practices for accessing relevant and reliable information about disability and sexuality, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 5 participants. Results show that there are several topics which participants thought should be better explored in the context of disability and sexuality, but most available sex education resources are not inclusive. Moreover, people with disabilities, especially when young or less used to self-advocate for their own needs, face difficulties engaging in meaningful conversations around sexuality. Based on the results of our research, we make recommendations for areas where HCI research could significantly contribute to make intimate interactions more accessible.},

Next, a within-subjects user testing study was performed to compare two functional prototypes that differed only in their structure: one replicated the existing website structure, whereas the other implemented the structure produced by card sort data analysis. Results showed that participants using the redesigned structure had significantly better usability metrics (first click success rate, task time, SEQ score and SUS score) compared to when interacting with the existing structure. These findings provide support for the validity of the open card sorting method for the design of website information structures.},

abstract = {Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a set of neurodevelopmental conditions, often characterised by important impairments in the social area. In the context of early intervention, we present preliminary results about the social behaviour of children with ASD using PlusMe as an experimental interactive toy, which is the first prototype of Transitional Wearable Companions concept. Specifically, PlusMe is designed to stimulate the children’s curiosity and encourage behaviour on the basis of social interaction. The pilot test involved five high-functioning children, mean age 41 months, range 36-50 months. The participants were engaged in play activities together with the PlusMe toy and two researchers who aimed to encourage the children’s social behaviour such as imitation and eye contact; the activities were repeated for four sessions (one per week). Although it is an ongoing study on a larger sample, the first data analysis is promising, preliminary observations seem to demonstrate that PlusMe can be used to improve some social behaviour such as eye contact, imitation, the interaction between two people.},

abstract = {With the development of social media, various rumors can be easily spread on the Internet and such rumors can have serious negative effects on society. Thus, it has become a critical task for social media platforms to deal with suspected rumors. However, due to the lack of effective tools, it is often difficult for platform administrators to analyze and validate rumors from a large volume of information on a social media platform efficiently. We have worked closely with social media platform administrators for four months to summarize their requirements of identifying and analyzing rumors, and further proposed an interactive visual analytics system, RumorLens, to help them deal with the rumor efficiently and gain an in-depth understanding of the patterns of rumor spreading. RumorLens integrates natural language processing (NLP) and other data processing techniques with visualization techniques to facilitate interactive analysis and validation of suspected rumors. We propose well-coordinated visualizations to provide users with three levels of details of suspected rumors: an overview displays both spatial distribution and temporal evolution of suspected rumors; a projection view leverages a metaphor-based glyph to represent each suspected rumor and further enable users to gain a quick understanding of their overall characteristics and similarity with each other; a propagation view visualizes the dynamic spreading details of a suspected rumor with a novel circular visualization design, and facilitates interactive analysis and validation of rumors in a compact manner. By using a real-world dataset collected from Sina Weibo, one case study with a domain expert is conducted to evaluate RumorLens. The results demonstrated the usefulness and effectiveness of our approach.},

This work presents a script-based meta-analysis on addressed populations in accessibility research published on top Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) venues (3617 full papers). We categorize the publications regarding the involved people and their disabilities. We found that work on vision disability makes up for almost one third (28.85%) of the work published in general HCI. In light of these findings, we present possible conference- and funding-related explanatory approaches and argue that disability research could more reflect the prevalence of disabilities in the world.},

abstract = {Virtual Reality (VR) headsets have the unique capability to create private virtual content anywhere around the user, going beyond the capacities of traditional devices, but are not widely used while travelling, due to safety and comfort concerns. Showing objects from reality - "Reality Anchors" - could help reduce these concerns. We present a user study (N=20) that investigates how the use of real-world cues and different VR environments affect users’ feelings of safety, social acceptability, awareness, presence, escapism and immersion, which are key barriers to VR adoption. Our findings show that knowing where other people are on the bus could significantly reduce concerns associated with VR use in transit, resulting in increased feelings of safety, social acceptability and awareness, but with the concession that the user's immersion may be reduced. The VR environment also affected the level of immersion and the feelings of escapism, with a 360-video environment returning higher scores than a 2D one.},

abstract = {Electric muscle stimulation (EMS) offers rich opportunities for haptic interaction. However, there is no comprehensive study assessing the user acceptance of this technology. Consequently, we synthesized four scenarios (motor learning, virtual reality, media player control, and pedestrian safety) based on various dimensions identified by the literature review. We assessed their user acceptance in an online survey (N=113) using the technology acceptance model (TAM). Our findings suggest that users may reject EMS systems if they perceive a high level of risk and lack of control over the environment. This was evident even in scenarios that could provide high benefits to users, such as accelerating the learning curve in motoric tasks. In contrast, EMS seems to be widely accepted for games and entertainment, represented by the virtual reality scenario in our study. HCI researchers should employ EMS to create more engaging VR experiences, keep users in control, and provide them the option of learning skills with or without EMS. Our results will help build better EMS systems accepted by users.},

Although reproducing ML errors is essential for having a good representation, they are rarely considered. We introduce Wizard of Errors (WoE), a tool for conducting WoZ studies on ML-enabled solutions that allows simulating ML errors during user experience assessment. We explored how this system can be used to simulate the behavior of a computer vision model. We tested WoE with design students to determine the importance of considering ML errors in design, the relevance of using descriptive error types instead of confusion matrix, and the suitability of manual error control in WoZ studies. Our work identifies several challenges, which prevent realistic error representation by designers in such studies. We discuss the implications of these findings for design.},

abstract = {Various tools and approaches are available to support undergraduate students learning to program. Most of them concentrate on the code and aim to ease the visualization of data structures or guide the debugging. However, in undergraduate introductory courses, students are typically given exercises in the form of a natural language problem. Deriving a correct solution largely depends on the problem-solving strategy they adopt rather than on their proficiency in dealing with the syntax and semantics of the code. Indeed, they face various challenges (apart from the coding), such as identifying the relevant information, stating the algorithmic steps to solve it, breaking it into smaller parts, and evaluating the implemented solution. To our knowledge, almost no attention has been paid to supporting such problem-solving strategies before and during the coding. This paper reports an interview and a sketching exercise with 10 participants exploring how the novices approach the programming exercises from a problem-solving perspective and how they imagine a tool to support their cognitive process. Findings show that students intuitively perform various actions over the exercise text, and they would appreciate having support from the development environment. Accordingly, based on these findings, we provide implications for designing tools to support problem-solving strategies.},

We present StickyLand, a notebook extension for empowering users to freely organize their code in non-linear ways. With sticky cells that are always shown on the screen, users can quickly access their notes, instantly observe experiment results, and easily build interactive dashboards that support complex visual analytics. Case studies highlight how our tool can enhance notebook users’s productivity and identify opportunities for future notebook designs.

To address this gap, we ran five online co-design workshops with 44 teenagers (aged 13-18 years) in the United Kingdom to design a self-tracking guide for teens. We focused on content, presentation of information, and distribution strategy. Our findings highlight the complexity of creating resources which adeptly capture the needs of this diverse user group. To successfully build interactive educational resources appropriate for teens’ positive engagement with health-related self-tracking tools, designers and researchers must prioritize teen-centered design with a focus on: (1) teens’ core reasons for self-tracking and (2) opportunities for social support and community-building.},

Therefore, we conducted interviews with 18 African Americans with chronic conditions to discover what types of challenges they faced while searching for trustworthy information on COVID-19 and the strategies they used to overcome these challenges. We found that participants actively evaluated the credibility of different information sources, searched for first-hand information from people they could relate to, and tried to avoid or reduce media consumption to prevent information overload.},

Given the pervasiveness of cigarette smoking, high rates of relapse, and limitations of existing treatments, it is critical to explore new methods of relapse prevention. Our solution draws from acupuncture's global use in treating addiction and recent evidence that non-invasive TEAS can reduce the urge to smoke after exposure to a drug-related cue. Specifically, we have designed a device formed to four acupoints (LI4, PC8, PC6, and TH5) located on the wrist and hand, and programmed to deliver 5-15mA stimulation. Through a paired mobile application, individuals are simultaneously guided through an MBRP intervention to help them take control of their response to the trigger. Together, this system provides real-time relief from the urge to smoke so individuals can better engage with cognitive behavioral relapse prevention strategies in high risk moments.},

This aims to support the user-centered maturity of the organization by developing employees’ curiosity and empathy towards users.

abstract = {For non-sport fans, perceiving the excitement of surrounding fan groups and the arousal of collective emotions are some of the crucial factors that motivate their engaged excitement and loyalty in a sport; these factors are closely related to the process of evolution from a non-fan to a fan. The global COVID-19 pandemic changed the way of sport-watching from watching at the arena to watching from home alone. This has highlighted significant difficulties in the excitement transmission and arousal channel between non-sport fans and fans. Previous remote emotional intervening mediums had been limited to the use of virtual avatars to convey partners’ external cues (such as appearance), to enhance the sense of presence from visual-audio perspectives. In this study, we explored a novel remote emotional intervening medium that conveys sport-fans’ internal cues (bio-signals) that are widely believed to be related to internal emotional states of human, and displays those signals in a way that gives non-sport fans a deeper and more immersive experience: haptic feedback experience. Three bio-signal-based haptic feedback prototypes were developed, including heart-rate-based vibration, electromyography (EMG)-based pressure, and skin-temperature-based thermal feedbacks. An exploratory pilot study was conducted on a group of non-sport fans in a lab-control environment of remote-sport-watching to explore the effectiveness of the proposed mediums in enhancing their perception of sport-fan’s excitement (emotion perception). Besides, we also analyzed non-sport fans’ heart rate data when they were participants in the experiments to measure the performance of the proposed mediums in evoking the engaged excitement of non-sport fans (emotion arousal). Our results indicate the outstanding ability of EMG-based pressure feedback in effectively enhancing the process of emotion perception and the notable advantage of heart-rate-based vibration feedback in the arousal of non-sport fans’ engaged excitement. This study presents the potential utility of bio-signal-based haptic feedback in augmenting remote emotional perception and arousal and also provides the underlining support for the future exploration and development directions for social computing based on bio-signals and haptic technologies.},

abstract = {Abilene Christian University recently rolled out multi-factor authentication (MFA) to the entire student body. Previous work has found frequent negative reactions and dissent experienced in university settings in regard to MFA. This can lead to decreased compliance or the use of less secure passwords to compensate. We hypothesize these responses are tied to the emotional impact of using required MFA for critical tasks. We present an empirical study on user perception of adopting two-factor authentication (n=465). Our findings indicate that, due to the time sensitive nature of many tasks that required MFA, university students are likely to experience strong negative emotions towards MFA that drastically lower their perceptions of its utility and usability. However, our findings also show that these negative emotions can be at least partially mitigated when users feel more personally secure due to MFA, which can in part be controlled by rollout strategy and communication.},

abstract = {Participatory design (PD) for Artificially Intelligent (AI) systems has gained in popularity in recent years across multiple application domains, both within the private and public sectors. PD methods broadly enable stakeholders of diverse backgrounds to inform new use cases for AI and the design of AI-based technologies that directly impact people's lives. Such participation can be vital for mitigating adverse implications of AI on society that are becoming increasingly apparent and pursuing more positive impact, especially to vulnerable populations. This panel brings together researchers who have, or are, conducting participatory design of AI systems across diverse subject areas. The goal of the panel is to elucidate similarities and differences, as well as successes and challenges, in how PD methods can be applied to Artificially Intelligent systems in practical and meaningful ways. The panel serves as an opportunity for the HCI research community to collectively reflect on opportunities for PD of AI to facilitate collaboration amongst stakeholders, as well as persistent challenges to participatory AI design.},

abstract = {This work presents NERO, a game concept using the player’s active emotional input to map the emotional state of the player to representative in-game characters. Emotional input in games has been mainly used as a passive measure to adjust for game difficulty or other variables. However the player has not been given the possibility to explore and play with one’s emotions as an active feature. Given the high subjectivity of felt emotions we wanted to focus on the player’s experience of emotional input rather than the objective accuracy of the input sensor. We therefore implemented a proof-of-concept game using heart-rate as a proxy for emotion measurement and through repeated player tests the game mechanics were revised and evaluated. Valuable insight for the design of entertainment-focused emotional input games were gained, including emotional connection despite limited accuracy, influence of the environment and the importance of calibration. The players overall enjoyed the novel game experience and their feedback carries useful implications for future games including active emotional input.},

abstract = {The increasing capabilities of Artificial Intelligence enable the support of users in a continuously growing number of applications. Current systems typically dictate that interaction between user input and AI output unfolds in discrete steps, as is the case with, for example, conversational agents. Novel scenarios require AI systems to adapt and respond to continuous user input, e.g., image-guided surgery and AI-supported text entry. In and across these applications, AI systems need to support more varied and dynamic interactions in which users and AI interact continuously and in parallel. Current methods and guidelines are often inadequate and sometimes even detrimental to user needs when considering continuous usage scenarios. Realizing a continuous interaction between users and AI requires a substantial change in perspective when designing Human-AI systems. In this SIG, we support the exchange of cutting-edge research contributing to a better understanding and improved methods and tools to design continuous Human-AI interaction.},

We tested the application in a usability study (n = 25) where we observed participants using the application. Most participants affirmed that this application would help them feel more grateful. Participants also had an overall positive response to the AR experience for expressing gratitude and suggested novel and unexpected uses for the application as well as potential for misuse. We believe this study demonstrates the potential of using AR technology in new ways to positively influence the human-centered design space of gratitude.},

abstract = {Computational approaches for user interfaces have been used in adapting interfaces for different modalities, usage scenarios and device form factors, understanding screen semantics for accessibility, task-automation, information extraction, and in assisting interface design. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) have drawn considerable attention across HCI and related fields such as computer vision and natural language processing, leading to new ML-based user interface approaches. Similarly, significant progress has been made with more traditional optimization- and planning-based approaches to accommodate the need for adapting UIs for screens with different sizes, orientations and aspect ratios, and in emerging domains such as VR/AR and 3D interfaces. The proposed workshop seeks to bring together researchers interested in all kinds of computational approaches for user interfaces across different sectors as a community, including those who develop algorithms and models and those who build applications, to discuss common issues including the need for resources, opportunities for new applications, design implications for human-AI interaction in this domain, and practical challenges such as user privacy.},

Prior studies have developed a variety of stand-alone techniques to support technology non-use, but few have attempted to build interventions directly into technologies to regulate usage. My research seeks to address this issue in the context of games by exploring the relationship players intend to have with games, especially their desired balance between play and non-play, and designing built-in interventions in games to help support this relationship. I will conduct qualitative interviews to understand players’ ideal relationships with games, and quantitative experiments to investigate the impact of built-in interventions on such relationships. Through these investigations, I attempt to develop a theoretical framework to understand users’ intended relationship with technologies and provide guidance on intervention designs that contribute to digital well-being.},

HCI has contributed to these discussions, mainly with studies on user experiences and user interfaces of telepresence robots. However, only a few telerobot studies have addressed everyday use in real-world learning environments. In the post-COVID 19 world, sociotechnical uncertainties and unforeseen challenges to learning in hybrid learning environments constitute a unique frontier where robotic and immersive technologies can mediate learning experiences. The aim of this workshop is to set the stage for a new wave of HCI research that accounts for and begins to develop new insights, concepts, and methods for use of immersive and telerobotic technologies in real-world learning environments. Participants are invited to collaboratively define an HCI research agenda focused on robot-mediated learning in the wild, which will require examining end-user engagements and questioning underlying concepts regarding telerobots for learning.},

The HCI community has been increasingly interested in investigating the worker-centric issues inherent in the current model and seeking for potential improvements that could be implemented in the future. This workshop explores how a reimagined perspective on crowdsourcing platforms could provide a more equitable, fair, and rewarding experience. This includes not only the workers but also the platforms, who could benefit e.g. from better processes for worker onboarding, skills-development, and growth. We invite visionary takes in various formats on this topic to spread awareness of worker-centric research and developments to the CHI community. As a result of interactive ideation work in the workshop, we articulate a future direction roadmap for research centred around crowdsourcing platforms. Finally, as a specific interest area, the workshop seeks to study crowdwork from the context of the Global South, which has been arising as an important but critically understudied crowdsourcing market in recent years.},

In this workshop, we propose to bring together HCI scholars and practitioners, whose work is associated with various faiths, religions, and spiritual practices to start this important conversation, with a focus on three questions: (a) does secularization in computing marginalize faith-based values? and if so, how? (b) how can HCI design address the unique needs and values of faith-based communities? and (c) how can scholarship and practice in HCI benefit from the integration of faith, religion, and spirituality? We hope to form an HCI community of scholars and practitioners focused on the intersection of faith/spirituality/religion and computing.},

Adding to the challenge, the Lookout was installed outside in a city centre for widespread public use. Despite these challenges, a COVID-safe touchable device was embedded and extensively used. This Case Study reports the co-creation of the device noting COVID restriction adaptations over a nine-month deployment. Our contributions are twofold: the study acts as a case-point of the impact of the unique COVID design context, with lessons for future pandemic scenarios; and, given we had over 10,000 users at a time when people were cautious about using shared devices or services, we surface some design characteristics that can promote the use of public technology.},

abstract = {Our everyday digital tasks require access to information from a wide range of applications and systems. Although traditional search systems can help find information, they usually operate within one application (e.g., email client or web browser) and require the user’s cognitive effort and attention to formulate proper search queries. In this paper, we demonstrate EntityBot, a system that proactively provides useful and supporting entities across application boundaries without requiring explicit query formulation. Our methodology is to exploit the context from screen frames captured every 2 seconds to recommend relevant entities for the current task. Recommendations are not restricted to only documents but include various kinds of entities, such as applications, documents, contact persons, and keywords representing the tasks. Recommendations are actionable, that is, a user can perform actions on recommended entities, such as opening documents and applications. The EntityBot also includes support for interactivity, allowing the user to affect the recommendations by providing explicit feedback on the entities. The usefulness of entity recommendations and their impact on user behavior has been evaluated in a user study based on real-world tasks. Quantitative and qualitative results suggest that the system had an actual impact on the tasks and led to high user satisfaction.},
