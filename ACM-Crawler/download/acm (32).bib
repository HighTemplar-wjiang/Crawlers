abstract = {In this SIG, we aim at gathering researchers and practitioners to reflect on using XR technologies to support collaborative learning and co-creation, and to foster a joint force by connecting the Learning and Education community and the XR community at CHI. We witness a significant increase in CHI publications relating to these research areas: 292 titles about "collaborative learning" or "co-creation" since 2015 compared to 96 in 2010-2014; and 1180 titles about XR since 2015 compared to 288 in 2010-2014. This SIG will bring together researchers, educators, designers and practitioners to 1) stimulate a cross-disciplinary discussion on the opportunities of collaborative learning and co-creation in XR; 2) foresee the future directions, standards and obstacles to introduce XR to education; and 3) build a joint community connecting XR and education research at CHI.},

Social Virtual Reality (VR) invites multiple users to join a collaborative virtual environment, which creates new opportunities for remote communication. The goal of social VR is not to completely replicate reality, but to facilitate and extend the existing communication channels of the physical world. Apart from the benefits provided by social VR, privacy concerns and ethical risks are raised when the boundary between the real and the virtual world is blurred. This workshop is intended to spur discussions regarding technology, evaluation protocols, application areas, research ethics and legal regulations for social VR as an emerging immersive remote communication tool.},

First, it aims to grow critical mass in Conversational User Interfaces (CUI) research by mapping the grand challenges in designing and researching these interactions. Second, this workshop is intended to further build the CUI community with these challenges in mind, whilst also growing CUI research presence at CHI. In particular, the workshop will survey and map topics such as: interaction design for text and voice-based CUI; the interplay between engineering efforts such as in Natural language Processing (NLP) and the design of CUI; practical CUI applications (e.g. human-robot interaction, public spaces, hands-free and wearables); and social, contextual, and cultural aspects of CUI design (e.g. ethics, privacy, trust, information exploration, persuasion, well-being, or decision-making, marginalized users). By drawing from the diverse interdisciplinary expertise that defines CHI, we are proposing this workshop as a platform on which to build a community that is better equipped to tackle an emerging field that is rapidly-evolving, yet is under-studied --- especially as the commercial advances seem to outpace the scholarly research in this space.},

This has included but is not limited to, work on designing within patriarchal contexts, designing around issues of gender and sexual orientation and designing around literacy. In tandem, local HCI initiatives such as ArabHCI [3] have emerged to address the misrepresentation of these populations in HCI research, highlighting the fact that Western originated design methods would require delicate adaptations to suit non-Western cultural contexts. With the same approach towards inclusivity and co-existence the aim of this workshop is to bring together HCI researchers and practitioners who engage in studies and interventions within Muslim majority communities around the world. The goal is to understand the Muslim identity and perceptions around it, the unique constraints and limitations within Muslim communities and to identify core issues and concerns within these populations. We will explore the following themes: refugees and islamophobia; Muslim feminism and Digital financial services.},

The role that technology can play in how people live as they approach end of life as well as in bereavement is full of rich possibilities, but research here is also fraught with ethical and methodological dilemmas. Although there has been a turn to focus on the topic of death by some in HCI we need to go far further to embrace the contexts relating to it more meaningfully and broadly. Through this design focused workshop, we will bring experts and interested parties together to creatively explore opportunities and challenges for HCI at the end of life and beyond. Discussions and design activities will be supported by conceptual resources for design, lived experience accounts, design methods and ethical resources. The workshop will provide a time and place to bring together experts but will also provide an open and accepting environment for those for whom HCI at end of life and beyond is a new area of concern.},

We are seeing use cases as diverse as education and pain management, with new applications being imagined every day. Virtual Reality technology comes with new challenges, and many obstacles need to be overcome to ensure good user experience. Recently many new Virtual Reality systems with integrated eye-tracking have become available. At the same time, many research labs are using Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) to non-invasively measure brain activity and serve as a brain-computer interface. This course presents timely, relevant information on how Virtual Reality can leverage eye-tracking and brain activity data to optimize the user experience and to alleviate usability issues surrounding many challenges in immersive VEs. The integration of these sensors allows us to determine additional insights into human behavior, including where the viewer is focusing their attention, and monitor cognitive load. Advancing these approaches could make the Virtual Reality experience more comfortable, safe and effective for the user, and open a new world to facilitate new experimentation for Human Computer Interaction (and Brain Computer Interaction) researchers.},

abstract = {Recommending fashion outfits requires learning a concept of style and fashionability that is typically human. There has been an increasing research effort into creating Machine Learning models able to learn such concepts, in order to distinguish between compatible and incompatible clothes and to select an item that would complete an outfit. However, most of the work done in literature tackles this problem from a pure Machine Learning point of view, disregarding real-case scenarios and the human interaction with systems able to generate outfits. This work tries to move the problem of generating outfits to the Recommender Systems domain by presenting as its main contribution a novel algorithm for a fashion-specific Recommender System that generates fashionable outfits, able to scale its inference time to be useful in real use case scenarios, and applies such algorithm on public and industrial datasets. In addition to this, this work shows preliminary results on how this algorithm can be employed in a real scenario and reports as preliminary results the evaluations provided by three professional stylists on the outfits generated by such algorithms.},

abstract = {Visualizers are usually added into music players to augment the listening experiences of hearing users. However, for the case of most members of the Deaf and Hard of Hearing (DHH) community, they have partial deafness which may give them a "limited" listening experience as compared to their counterparts. In this paper, we present ViTune, a visualizer tool that enhances the musical experiences of the DHH through the use of an on-screen visualizer generating effects alongside music. We observed how members of the DHH community typically experienced music through an initial user study. We then iterated on developing a visualizer prototype where we did multiple usability tests involving at least 15 participants from the DHH community. We observed how they experienced music with the help of our prototype and noticed that certain music features and elements augmented these experiences. Visualization attributes, their matching qualitative descriptions and equivalent subjective attributes were identified with the help of music experts. Also, affects hypothesized to be induced and dissuaded were identified in improving these listening experiences.},

abstract = {This work proposes a combination of embedded computation and marker tracking to provide more robust augmentations for composed objects in Tangible Augmented Reality. By integrating conductive elements into the tangibles' sides, communication between embedded microprocessors is enabled, such that a connected composition can be computed without relying on any marker tracking information. Consequently, the virtual counterparts of the tangibles can be aligned, and this virtual composition can be attached to a single marker as a whole, increasing the tracking robustness towards occlusions and perspective distortions. A technical evaluation shows that this approach provides more robust augmentations if a tangible block in a composition is occluded by at least 50% or perspectively distorted by at least 40 to 50 degrees, depending on the block's size. Additionally, a test with users relying on the use case of a couch configuration tool shows promising results regarding usability and user experience.},

People often regret using their resources unfavorably (i.e., buyers' remorse or impulse buying) or take the pleasure of having something for granted before long (i.e., hedonic adaptation). Given its effects on optimizing positive experiences, positive emotion regulation can be useful for mitigating these issues. The present paper introduces PurPal, a self-administered behavioral intervention technology that enables users to up-regulate their positive emotions in the context of consumption. PurPal provides adaptive questions associated with users' purchase intentions, which stimulate reflection on possible future positive experiences with purchased items. A user study is planned to validate the efficacy of PurPal in a lab setting. The longer-term goal of the current research is to develop behavioral intervention technologies that support users' emotion regulation processes, enhancing their subjective well-being.},

abstract = {When it comes to algorithmic rights and protections for children, designers will need to face new paradigms to solve problems they are targeting. The field of Design typically deals with form and function and is executed in molecules or pixels. But algorithms have neither. More importantly, algorithms may be biased in their execution against those without privileged status such as people of color, children, and the non-affluent. In this paper, we review our work on exploring perceptions of fairness in AI through co-design sessions with children of color in non-affluent neighborhoods of Baltimore City. The design sessions aimed at designing an artificially intelligent librarian for their local branch. Our preliminary findings showcase three key themes of this group's perceptions of fairness in the context of an artificially intelligent authority figure.},

Therefore, when users shake the ElastOscillation device, the proxy shakes or moves in the corresponding movement ranges or levels. The users then perceive the force from oscillation in different levels. In addition, elastic force from the bands further reinforces the oscillation force feedback. In the demonstration, users can explore four VR applications that feel the sensation of pan-flipping, bartender-shaking, wine-swirling and fishing.},

That is, liveness boosted participants' engagement when programming an SV, and so, the sessions were highly interactive and participants were willing to spend much time using our toolkit (i.e., median ≥ 1.5 hours). Participants used our integrated toolkit to deal with data transformations, visual mappings, and view transformations without leaving the immersive environment. Finally, participants benefited from our expressive toolkit and employed multiple of the available features when programming an SV.},

Much like visual user interface design, conversation design benefits from prototyping and user testing to allow for conversation exploration and improvement. However, it can be overwhelming to quickly iterate on the conversation design as the iterative process requires not only designing a conversation but also building and testing a working chatbot equipped with the conversation. We developed ProtoChat, a prototype system that supports an iterative conversation design by allowing designers to (1) prototype conversations, (2) test the conversations with the crowd, and (3) review and analyze the crowdsourced conversation data. Results of an exploratory study with four conversation designers show that the designers successfully iterated on their conversation design by reviewing how the crowd followed the conversation, which provided insights into concrete action items for improving their conversation design.},

Existing studies detect and quantify biases based on pre-defined attributes. However, in real practices, it is difficult to gather a comprehensive list of sensitive concepts for various categories of biases. We propose a general methodology to quantify dataset biases by measuring the difference of its data distribution with a reference dataset using Maximum Mean Discrepancy. For the case of natural language data, we show that lexicon-based features quantify explicit stereotypes, while deep learning-based features further capture implicit stereotypes represented by complex semantics. Our method provides a more flexible way to detect potential biases.},

Through a user study with 24 participants, we show that our prototype leads to a significantly higher text input performance compared to soft keyboards. However, it falls behind on copy editing compared to soft keyboards.

abstract = {Intelligent connected vehicles (ICVs) are the foundation to create an intelligent transport eco-system. While the population of ICV users is gradually increasing, the motives underlying use of ICVs remain unclear. Here, we developed a scale to measure motives for ICV use. Taken the results of explorative factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis together, we suggested a four-factor model: symbolic, instrumental, affective-self, and affective-other motives. We found that ICV users with different characteristics in age, annual income and driving distance evaluated the importance of motives differently. ICV users who are richer and drive longer distances are more likely to show higher symbolic and affective-self motives. Also, users' symbolic motive grows with age. Finally, we found that symbolic and affective motives correlated highly with social norms and loyalty, while instrumental motives related to perceived control feelings toward operating the vehicle. These findings shed novel insights on how to design ICVs and make related policies.},

abstract = {The traffic system is a complex network with numerous individuals (e.g., drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians) and vehicles involved. Road systems vary in various aspects such as the number of lanes, right of way, and configuration. With the emergence of autonomous vehicles, this system will change. Research has already addressed the missing communication possibilities when no human driver is needed. However, there is no common evaluation standard for the proposed external communication concept with respect to the complexity of the traffic system. We have therefore investigated the evaluation of these in Virtual Reality, in monitor-based, and in prototypical setups with special regard to scalability. We found that simulated traffic noise is a non-factor in current evaluations and that involving multiple people and multiple lanes with numerous vehicles is scarce.},

However, professional video descriptions are costly and time-consuming. Volunteer-created video descriptions could be a promising alternative, however, they can vary in quality and can be intimidating for novice describers. We developed a Human-in-the-Loop Machine Learning (HILML) approach to video description by automating video text generation and scene segmentation while allowing humans to edit the output. Our HILML system was significantly faster and easier to use for first-time video describers compared to a human-only control condition with no machine learning assistance. The quality of the video descriptions and understanding of the topic created by the HILML system compared to the human-only condition were rated as being significantly higher by blind and visually impaired users.},

abstract = {Spreadsheets allow end users to blend calculations with arbitrary layout and formatting. However, when it comes to reusing groups of formulae along with layout and formatting, spreadsheets provide only limited support. Most users rely on copy and paste, which is easy to learn and use, but maintaining several copies can be tedious and error-prone. We present the concept of Gridlets, an abstraction over calculation and presentation applicable in common use case scenarios. Using the Cognitive Dimensions of Notations framework, we compare Gridlets to copy/paste and sheet-defined functions. We find that Gridlets are consistent with the spreadsheet paradigm, enable users to take advantage of secondary notation, and make common edit operations less viscous and less error-prone.},

abstract = {As Queer Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) becomes an established part of the larger field, both in terms of research on and with queer populations and in terms of employing queering theories and methods, the role of queer researchers has become a timely topic of discussion. However, these discussions have largely centered around member-researcher status and positionality when working with queer populations. Based on insights gathered at multiple ACM events over the past year, we identified two pressing issues: (1) we need to better support queer people doing HCI research not specific to queer populations, and (2) we need to identify how to best support member-researchers in leading Queer HCI while including collaborators beyond the queer community. This Special Interest Group (SIG) aims to directly address these challenges by convening a broad community of queer researchers and allies, working not only on explicitly-queer topics but across a broad range of HCI topics.},

HCI research typically explores positive aspects of these technologies, focusing on interaction, presence and immersive experiences. However, such technological advances and paradigm shifts often fail to consider the "dark patterns", with potential abusive scenarios, made possible by new technologies (cf. smartphone addiction, social media anxiety disorder). While these topics are getting recent attention in related fields and with the general population, this workshop is aimed at starting an active exploration of abusive, ethical, social and political scenarios of MR research inside the HCI community. With an HCI lens, workshop participants will engage in critical reviews of emerging MR technologies and applications and develop a joint research agenda to address them.},

abstract = {Current technologies designed for mental health support often have low adoption rates and may not fit people's routines. However, recent literature demonstrates that individuals managing mental illness often incorporate a variety of technologies into their self-management routines, including texting, music, wearables, online communities, games, and social media. Therefore, adopting a perspective focused on understanding the technology ecosystem of mental health management may be a better approach than focusing on singular platforms and applications. In this CHI workshop, we will examine a constellation of digital and non-digital mental health support resources. We will discuss the needs and practices of individuals managing mental illness, how these needs relate to future ecosystems of technologies and services, and the potentials and repercussions of current technologies. By convening a group of interdisciplinary researchers and practitioners, we will collectively address these topics to create resources attentive to individuals' lived experiences with mental illness, goals with respect to management and recovery, and interactions with existing forms of resources, care, and technology.},

abstract = {HCI has long considered sites of workplace collaboration. From airline cockpits to distributed groupware systems, scholars emphasize the importance of supporting a multitude of tasks and creating technologies that integrate into collaborative work settings. More recent scholarship highlights a growing need to consider the concerns of workers within and beyond established workplace settings or roles of employment, from steelworkers whose jobs have been eliminated with post-industrial shifts in the economy to contractors performing the content moderation that shapes our social media experiences. This one-day workshop seeks to bring together a growing community of HCI scholars concerned with the labor upon which the future of work we envision relies. We will discuss existing methods for studying work that we find both productive and problematic, with the aim of understanding how we might better bridge current gaps in research, policy, and practice. Such conversations will focus on the challenges associated with taking a worker-oriented approach and outline concrete methods and strategies for conducting research on labor in changing industrial, political, and environmental contexts.},

abstract = {Elastic Legs Illusion (ELI) provides the striking illusory experience of having a longer legs where the virtual legs are visually stretched from the first-person perspective. This illusion works without any experimenter's assist; a single subject wearing a HMD sits on a floor with both legs stretched straight out against a wooden-plate and pulls backward a handle connected with rubber-material tube, that is anchored at the plate. A weight scale (Wii Balance Board) is placed sandwiched between the both legs and the plate where the more strongly the subject pulls the handle the more load is transferred to both legs as well as to the weight scale. ELI correlates this increment of the weight scale with the stretch ratio of the legs in HMD space. Thus, the sense of legs being pushed back against the plate is transformed into a sense of having longer legs. The system was tested in our laboratory exhibition, showing 33 out of 44 participants agreed with having longer legs strongly.},

There is a small number of counseling chatbots for victims of sexual crime, but none targeting teenagers specifically. This research suggests design guidelines for building a counseling chatbot for teenage victims of online sexual exploitation with a focus on establishing rapport by empathizing with their stories and providing them with the proper information. We conducted in-depth interviews with peer counselors at the Teenage Women's Human Rights Center, who have been consulting teenage victims in their age group using online messengers. The four key findings from our research suggested using open-ended questions, using teenager-friendly language, helping teenagers understand that they are victims and offering age-relevant information.},
