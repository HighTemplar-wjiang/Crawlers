abstract = {We present Lotus; an actuated plant-like device designed to guide the user through breathing exercises. The development of Lotus explores whether IoT devices can aid in the practice of mindfulness and reducing stress. Lotus uses heart rate (HR) monitoring to detect high levels of stress and trigger the start of its guided exercises through the movement of its petals. An initial study proved that Lotus may help users to reduce their stress.},

abstract = {In this work, we present ALEEDSA: the first system for performing interactive machine learning with augmented reality. The system is characterized by the following three distinctive features: First, immersion is used for visualizing machine learning models in terms of their outcomes. The outcomes can then be compared against domain knowledge (e.g., via counterfactual explanations) so that users can better understand the behavior of machine learning models. Second, interactivity with augmented reality along the complete machine learning pipeline fosters rapid modeling. Third, collaboration enables a multi-user setting, wherein machine learning engineers and domain experts can jointly discuss the behavior of machine learning models. The effectiveness of our proof-of-concept is demonstrated in an experimental study involving both students and business professionals. Altogether, ALEEDSA provides a more straightforward utilization of machine learning in organizational and educational practice.},

It is important that children get exposed to these technologies as earlier as possible, especially there is a high demand for developing expertise and awareness in the underwater robot. Although examples of making toolkit for children currently exist, few focus specifically on integration with the water environment. In this paper, we explore the making toolkit, ModBot, which can be applied to the water environment. The hardware was developed using electronic, counterweight, and shape modules that can be manipulated to build underwater robots. The software application allows children to learn concepts and receive construction feedback. This paper presents the system design of ModBot, the design rationale, and a user study for the usability of ModBot. Our system is expected to spark children's interests and creativity of underwater robots, and foster their understanding of the water environment.},

abstract = {Modern electronic design automation (EDA) tooling tends to focus on either the system-level design or the low-level electrical connectivity between physical components on a printed circuit board (PCB). We believe that a usable and functional system for circuit design needs to be able to interleave both levels of abstraction seamlessly and allow designers to transition between them freely. Existing work has experimented with approaches like circuit synthesis, functional characterization, or fine grained physical modeling. Each of these approaches augment the design process as it exists today, with its fundamental split between various levels of abstraction. We notice that hierarchical block diagrams can capture both high-level system structure as well as fine grained physical connectivity, and use that symmetry to construct a model for electronic circuits that can span the entire design process. Additionally, we construct user interfaces for our model that can support users of different skill levels throughout a design task. We discuss the design of our system, detailing both fundamental abstractions and usability trade-offs, and demonstrate its current capabilities through the design of example electronics projects.},

We developed a prototype using seven everyday objects and evaluated ARphy through a qualitative user study. Our findings indicate that ARphy is intuitive, immersive, and enjoyable and has the potential for selectively managing collections using photos and objects that have personal meanings.},

Results revealed that key shape affects text entry speed, dimension affects accuracy, while both affect user experience. Overall, square-shaped 3D keys yielded the best actual and perceived performance, also was the most preferred by the users.},

How to predict the motion from image and visualize for training is a challenging topic for computer vision. In this paper, we present a real-time table tennis forecasting system using a long short-term pose prediction network. Our system can predict the landing point of a serve before the pingpong ball is even hit using the previous and present motions of a player, which is captured only using a single RGB camera. In the precision evaluation, our system shows an acceptable accuracy and the max difference is 8.9 cm. From another pilot study, we know that our system could help the amateur to return an expert's serve. As training application, this system can be either used for training beginner's prediction skill, or used for practitioners to train how to hide their serve from being predicted.},

abstract = {People with dementia often experience a lack of social engagement after moving from the home environment into long-term care. Professional caregivers aim to build social relations with residents in dementia care homes to empower and socially include them during everyday care. However, the natural imbalance between the caregiver and the cared-for positions the person with dementia in a passive role, making it difficult for them to initiate and build relations with caregivers. In this paper, we present 'Turnaround' as a design exploration into care relations and the potential role of design to support these relations. Turnaround is a musical interface to facilitate collaborative acts of music-making. Our preliminary results reveal how the role of resident and caregiver shifted towards equal partnership during the exploration and interaction with Turnaround. Furthermore, we argue that technologies should foster partnerships in care activities by facilitating shared forms of expression and reinforcement of agency.},

We then tested those questionnaire statements with 30 children after they completed puzzles in mobile apps; we assessed the statements' understandability, dimensionality, construct validity and reliability. Our adapted SUS statements were mostly understandable. A Principal Component Analysis resulted in a four-Component model; two of those components were established as reliable. However, we were only able to support construct validity for four questionnaire statements (and none of the four Components).

Users in 201 countries have created over 125,000 classification models. Here we outline the project and its key contributions of (1) a flexible, approachable interface for ML classification models without ML or coding expertise, (2) a set of technical and design decisions that can inform future interactive machine learning tools, and (3) an example of how structured learning content surrounding the tool supports people accessing ML concepts.},

From there, we discuss paths for HCI educators and students to engage with the co-creation of pluriversal learning spaces that resist universal notions of language, class content, and knowledge production.

abstract = {We outline the ideation, development, and gameplay of Safecracker, an interactive heist game. The game provides immersion through a multisensory gameplay experience. Players are engaged in thematic, audio-based mechanics while interacting with a tangible controller. Players attempt to break into a life-sized safe by determining its 3-number combination. Their primary crime-committing tool is a stethoscope, which listens for audio cues as they rotate the safe's dial. Headphones embedded within the stethoscope play distinct sounds when the dial approaches each number in the sequence. Once the player has identified all 3 numbers in the combination, the safe unlocks and opens, revealing different treasures depending on the selected difficulty level.},

abstract = {Interest in interactive bodily play and game design has increased during the last decade, often fueled by the medical industry's focus on exergames and a need for basic movement training. By dividing bodily interactions into bodily preconditions and surrounding conditions for interaction, Move Maker systematically explores basic bodily play dynamics in combination with digital interactive devices. This way, Move Maker offers a movement-based game system challenging basic movement abilities through bodily play explorations. Move Maker is designed for elderly people to play with their grandchildren (through a suite of ready to play minigames) and for designers and physiotherapists wanting to explore and develop novel bodily play constructions.},

We further varied rates of "learning" and personalization with the system to test user preferences and changes in participants' linguistic and psychological interactions with an unadapted versus adapted user model, and to determine whether those changes were attributable to acclimatization with the system or to the modeling capabilities, seeking to address 3 research questions: What are the psycholinguistic characteristics of user interactions with a dialogue system designed to act as a scheduling assistant? How does a system's ability to learn about a user and maintain a user model affect these interactions? Are changes in interaction styles uniquely attributable to user modeling ability rather than simply user familiarity or acclimation with the system? We present a linguistic analysis of the results using summary measures generated by a widely used psycholinguistic text analysis tool. Some of the measures seem to present the slightly paradoxical effect of reduced user engagement when a conversational agent explicitly discloses information about its user model to the user. These results suggest that future studies should take care to consider the degree to which the user model is directly exposed to the user. That is, being overly forthcoming about what has been learned about a user may undermine attempts to tailor conversational agents to actively engage and relate to users.},

abstract = {User Experience (UX) Design of Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications that assist knowledge-intensive tasks are usually the result of an iterative and fuzzy process. Although the combination of state-of-the-art technology with human expertise is undoubtedly valuable in the industry context, designing a user-centered tool that fits in the everyday activities of knowledge workers – supporting and augmenting their potential – is not a trivial work. User research uncovers pain points and opportunities, bringing the insights that inspire designers and Human Computer Interaction (HCI) experts. It allows a clear understanding of the context, which is the essence of a consistent interaction experience. Nevertheless, revealing the UX of the application and how AI in this context reshapes knowledge workers' everyday tasks is not straightforward and might also be an iterative process. In this paper, we present findings from a case study of the use of a storytelling method to design and validate the UX of AI assistants for the Oil &amp; Gas industry by using an animated sketch-based video.},

Research on the IAC has shown that four considerations should be taken into account in its application as a design tool. In this paper, we explore how well the IAC performs in design education. A case study reveals that design students are able to take all four considerations into account in the application of the IAC. However, the fourth consideration - to take contextual considerations into account - poses a significant challenge to them. Our discussion of this finding leads us to two obstacles for the application of the IAC in design education. Based on this discussion, we concluded that the fourth consideration may have to be replaced by the consideration to let the context of use directly inform the design process.},

abstract = {Some years ago, I began to read environmental philosophy such as deep ecology and Marxist interpretations. At the time I did not know what to do with this material, but my tree hugging instincts and experience of having seen my rural grandparents live a decent but very simple life inspired an abiding interest in the topics these philosophers were writing about. My grandparents grew a lot of their own food, kept an ancient car that my grandfather maintained, and enjoyed strong social ties with family and friends. It seems now that we must develop our own forms of simplicity and self-reliance if we are to weather the devastations the market economy is visiting on the planet. When I discovered computing colleagues worried about the same environmental issues I was, we collaborated to create the Computing within LIMITS community.LIMITS is a series of workshops focused on how to use computing tools and strategies to address global environmental problems. Inspired by the classic 1972 Limits to Growth report (itself a product of computing), the premise is that we must accept and embrace the reality that we live on a finite planet. That reality must inform and animate our work. The first LIMITS Workshop was held in 2015, with one each year since. The Sixth Annual Workshop is in June.Most computing research does not address or take into account the finiteness of Earth. In 2018, I first authored a paper with LIMITS colleagues for Communications of the ACM to discuss this matter. I was skeptical of acceptance, but perhaps it is a sign of the times that reviewers were surprisingly positive. The paper argues that problems of sustainability are socioeconomic in origin, and we can turn to the field of ecological economics to set a course. In a subsequent paper, "Design in the Age of Climate Change," I examined social movements that consider sustainability within an economic frame, such as the post-growth movement in Europe, the Transition Town movement, and food sovereignty movements worldwide. These movements draw from earlier ideas such as Gandhi's notion of abundance within simplicity.},

In this work, we explore haptic feedback on the wrist for interacting with virtual objects. We use Tasbi, a compact bracelet device capable of rendering complex multisensory squeeze and vibrotactile feedback. Leveraging Tasbi's haptic rendering, and using standard visual and audio rendering of a head mounted display, we present several interactions that tightly integrate sensory substitutive haptics with visual and audio cues. Interactions include push/pull buttons, rotary knobs, textures, rigid body weight and inertia, and several custom bimanual manipulations such as shooting an arrow from a bow. These demonstrations suggest that wrist-based haptic feedback substantially improves virtual hand-based interactions in AR/VR compared to no haptic feedback.},

abstract = {In order to improve the performance in putting, we design a weight switching device that can provide various switching angles. This paper proposes a system that can change the center of mass by switching the weight to different positions around the head of a putter. The proposed system starts switching the weight at the beginning of a downswing and ends before the putter hits a ball. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed system, we conducted a user study and examined if the face to path angle of the putter changed when the weight was switched to different positions. In the user study, the participant performed putting with different switching angles. In the analysis, we focused on the differences in the face to path angle among the switching angles. The user study showed that the proposed system is effective in changing the face to path angle when switching the weight away from the putter's shaft. Based on the experimental results, the proposed system contributes to affecting the face to path angle dynamically in real-time.},

abstract = {We address a recommendation task for next likely flight destination to customers of a major international airline company. We compare performance using historical flight data and an actual user evaluation. Using two years of historical flight data consisting of tens of millions of flights, an ensemble and a collaborative filtering approach obtained an accuracy of 47% and 20% using a test set of 100,000 customers, respectively, highlighting the challenge of the domain. We then evaluated our recommendations on 10,000 actual customers, with a 45-45-10 split among ensemble, collaborative filtering, and control group. The overall predictive power employed with real users was 23%, with the ensemble method having a predictive power of 19% and 30% for collaborative filtering. Results indicate that, in complex and shifting domains such as this one, one cannot rely solely on historical data for evaluating the impact of user recommendations. We discuss implications for recommendation systems and future research in this and related domains.},

abstract = {Technological advances in autonomous transportation systems have brought them closer to road use. However, little research is reported on children's behavior in autonomous buses (ABs) under real road conditions and on improving parents' trust in leaving their children alone in ABs. Thus, we aim to answer the research question: "How can we design ABs suitable for unaccompanied children so that the parents can trust them?" We conducted a study using a Wizard-of-Oz method to observe children's behavior and interview both parents and children to examine their needs in ABs. Using an affinity diagram, we grouped children's and parents' needs under the following categories: entertainment, communication, personal behavior, trust and desires. Using an iterative human-centered design process, we created an Otto system, a smartphone app for parents to communicate with their children and a tablet app for children to entertain during the ride.},

abstract = {Eye-hand coordination training systems are used to improve user performance during fast movements in sports training. In this work, we explored gaze tracking in a Virtual Reality (VR) sports training system with a VR headset. Twelve subjects performed a pointing study with or without passive haptic feedback. Results showed that subjects spent an average of 0.55 s to visually find and another 0.25 s before their finger selected a target. We also identified that, passive haptic feedback did not increase the performance of the user. Moreover, gaze tracker accuracy significantly deteriorated when subjects looked below their eye level. Our results also point out that practitioners/trainers should focus on reducing the time spent on searching for the next target to improve their performance through VR eye-hand coordination training systems. We believe that current VR eye-hand coordination training systems are ready to be evaluated with athletes.},

abstract = {Recently, the idea of using BCIs in Augmented Reality settings to operate systems has emerged. One problem of such head-mounted displays is the distraction caused by an unavoidable display of control elements even when focused on internal thoughts. In this project, we reduced this distraction by including information about the current attentional state. A multimodal smart-home environment was altered to adapt to the user's state of attention. The system only responded if the attentional orientation was classified as "external". The classification was based on multimodal EEG and eye tracking data. Seven users tested the attention-aware system in comparison to the unaware system. We show that the adaptation of the interface improved the usability of the system. We conclude that more systems would benefit from awareness of the user's ongoing attentional state.},

In this study, we examined pronunciation improvements, child engagement over time, and caregiver evaluation performance while using our game. We recruited ten children to play Apraxia World at home during two four-week treatment blocks, separated by a two-week break; nine of ten have completed the protocol at time of writing. In the treatment blocks, children's utterances were evaluated either by caregivers or an automated pronunciation framework. Preliminary analysis suggests that children made significant therapy gains with Apraxia World, even though caregivers evaluated pronunciation leniently. We also collected a corpus of child speech for offline examination. We will conduct additional analysis once all participants complete the protocol.},

However, for products with multiple moving parts that assume multiple poses during usage, 2D perspective sketching can be painstaking and time-consuming. In this study, we show that such multi-pose products are prevalent in the context of product design and therefore propose a 3D sketching system tailored to multi-pose products. Our system enables designers to sketch 3D curves that can be freely posed and easily viewed from different directions; it makes sketching chained moving parts and propagating changes to different poses and perspectives effortless. We show that, with interactions closely resembling traditional 2D perspective sketching and the physical manipulation of an articulated object, designers can focus solely on ideating, iterating, and communicating multi-pose product concepts during the initial stage of design.},
