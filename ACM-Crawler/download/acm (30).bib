abstract = {Video game toxicity, endemic to online play, represents a pervasive and complex problem. Antisocial behaviours in online play directly harm player wellbeing, enjoyment, and retention—but research has also revealed that some players normalize toxicity as an inextricable and acceptable element of the competitive video game experience. In this work, we explore perceptions of toxicity and how they are predicted by player traits, demonstrating that participants reporting a higher tendency towards Conduct Reconstrual, Distorting Consequences, Dehumanization, and Toxic Online Disinhibition perceive online game interactions as less toxic. Through a thematic analysis on willingness to report, we also demonstrate that players abstain from reporting toxic content because they view it as acceptable, typical of games, as banter, or as not their concern. We propose that these traits and themes represent contributing factors to the cyclical normalization of toxicity. These findings further highlight the multifaceted nature of toxicity in online video games.},

abstract = {Dance provides unique opportunities for embodied interdisciplinary learning experiences that can be personally and culturally relevant. danceON is a system that supports learners to leverage their body movement as they engage in artistic practices across data science, computing, and dance. The technology includes a Domain Specific Language (DSL) with declarative syntax and reactive behavior, a media player with pose detection and classification, and a web-based IDE. danceON provides a low-floor allowing users to bind virtual shapes to body positions in under three lines of code, while also enabling complex, dynamic animations that users can design working with conditionals and past position data. We developed danceON to support distance learning and deployed it in two consecutive cohorts of a remote, two-week summer camp for young women of color. We present our findings from an analysis of the experience and the resulting computational performances. The work identifies implications for how design can support learners’ expression across culturally relevant themes and examines challenges from the lens of usability of the computing language and technology.},

abstract = {Abstract: Force feedback devices, such as motor-based exoskeletons or wearables based on electrical muscle stimulation (EMS), have the unique potential to accelerate users’ own reaction time (RT). However, this speedup has only been explored while the device is attached to the user. In fact, very little is known regarding whether this faster reaction time still occurs after the user removes the device from their bodies–this is precisely what we investigated by means of a simple reaction time (RT) experiment, in which participants were asked to tap as soon as they saw an LED flashing. Participants experienced this in three EMS conditions: (1) fast-EMS, the electrical impulses were synced with the LED; (2) agency-EMS, the electrical impulse was delivered 40ms faster than the participant’s own RT, which prior work has shown to preserve one’s sense of agency over this movement; and, (3) late-EMS: the impulse was delivered after the participant’s own RT. Our results revealed that the participants’ RT was significantly reduced by approximately 8ms (up to 20ms) only after training with the agency-EMS condition. This finding suggests that the prioritizing agency during EMS training is key to motor-adaptation, i.e., it enables a faster motor response even after the user has removed the EMS device from their body.},

abstract = {Meditation is a mind-body practice with considerable wellbeing benefits that can take different forms. Novices usually start with focused attention meditation that supports regulation of attention towards an inward focus or internal bodily sensations and away from external stimuli or distractors. Most meditation technologies employ metaphorical mappings of meditative states to visual or soundscape representations to support awareness of mind wandering and attention regulation, although the rationale for such mappings is seldom articulated. Moreover, such external modalities also take the focus attention away from the body. We advance the concept of interoceptive interaction and employed the embodied metaphor theory to explore the design of mappings to the interoceptive sense of thermoception. We illustrate this concept with WarmMind, an on-body interface integrating heat actuators for mapping meditation states. We report on an exploratory study with 10 participants comparing our novel thermal metaphors for mapping meditation states with comparable ones, albeit in aural modality, as provided by Muse meditation app. Findings indicate a tension between the highly discoverable soundscape's metaphors which however hinder attention regulation, and the ambiguous thermal metaphors experienced as coming from the body and supported attention regulation. We discuss the qualities of embodied metaphors underpinning this tension and propose an initial framework to inform the design of metaphorical mappings for meditation technologies.},

abstract = {Understanding how and why people share negative emotions and thoughts on social media has received much scholarly attention. Scholars have identified a variety of factors that affect disclosure behavior, but as platforms offer a wider range of affordances that enable more diverse user behaviors and nuanced audience segmentation, these influencing factors are increasingly intertwined. However, little is known about the interrelatedness of platform, affordance, and audience. Drawing on survey data of 470 American adults during the COVID-19 pandemic, this study examines the interplay and relative strength of the factors influencing distress disclosure on social media. We introduce the concept of social media disclosure ecology as an analytical lens to understand online disclosure. The results suggest that perceived affordances (i.e., anonymity, persistence, visibility control) and relational closeness to audience separately and interactively predict the depth of distress disclosure, which in turn affects satisfaction with disclosure. This study contributes to the literature on online-disclosure and privacy, while providing implications for the design of social media to better support people in distress.},

abstract = {Directly manipulating the timeline, such as scrubbing for thumbnails, is the standard way of controlling how-to videos. However, when how-to videos involve physical activities, people inconveniently alternate between controlling the video and performing the tasks. Adopting a voice user interface allows people to control the video with voice while performing the tasks with hands. However, naively translating timeline manipulation into voice user interfaces (VUI) results in temporal referencing (e.g. “rewind 20 seconds”), which requires a different mental model for navigation and thereby limiting users’ ability to peek into the content. We present RubySlippers, a system that supports efficient content-based voice navigation through keyword-based queries. Our computational pipeline automatically detects referenceable elements in the video, and finds the video segmentation that minimizes the number of needed navigational commands. Our evaluation (N=12) shows that participants could perform three representative navigation tasks with fewer commands and less frustration using RubySlippers than the conventional voice-enabled video interface.},

We found that CAs empowered both the people who had MCI, and their care partners. We observed that the utility of the CA in the day-to-day lives of users largely depended on how much the care partner scaffolded promising functionality, setting it up and contextualizing it for specific needs and desires.},

abstract = {Online symptom checkers (OSC) are widely used intelligent systems in health contexts such as primary care, remote healthcare, and epidemic control. OSCs use algorithms such as machine learning to facilitate self-diagnosis and triage based on symptoms input by healthcare consumers. However, intelligent systems’ lack of transparency and comprehensibility could lead to unintended consequences such as misleading users, especially in high-stakes areas such as healthcare. In this paper, we attempt to enhance diagnostic transparency by augmenting OSCs with explanations. We first conducted an interview study (N=25) to specify user needs for explanations from users of existing OSCs. Then, we designed a COVID-19 OSC that was enhanced with three types of explanations. Our lab-controlled user study (N=20) found that explanations can significantly improve user experience in multiple aspects. We discuss how explanations are interwoven into conversation flow and present implications for future OSC designs.},

abstract = {We propose a nail-mounted foldable haptic device that provides tactile feedback to mixed reality (MR) environments by pressing against the user's fingerpad when a user touches a virtual object. What is novel in our device is that it quickly tucks away when the user interacts with real-world objects. Its design allows it to fold back on top of the user's nail when not in use, keeping the user's fingerpad free to, for instance, manipulate handheld tools and other objects while in MR. To achieve this, we engineered a wireless and self-contained haptic device, which measures 24\texttimes{}24\texttimes{}41&nbsp;mm and weighs 9.5&nbsp;g. Furthermore, our foldable end-effector also features a linear resonant actuator, allowing it to render not only touch contacts (i.e., pressure) but also textures (i.e., vibrations). We demonstrate how our device renders contacts with MR surfaces, buttons, low- and high-frequency textures. In our first user study, we found that participants perceived our device to be more realistic than a previous haptic device that also leaves the fingerpad free (i.e., fingernail vibration). In our second user study, we investigated the participants’ experience while using our device in a real-world task that involved physical objects. We found that our device allowed participants to use the same finger to manipulate handheld tools, small objects, and even feel textures and liquids, without much hindrance to their dexterity, while feeling haptic feedback when touching MR interfaces.},

Despite disparate approaches to incorporating digital tools in otherwise non-digital boardgames, there has to date been no detailed classification of the different roles that these tools play in supporting gameplay. In this paper, we present a model for understanding hybrid boardgame play as performing a set of discrete functions. Through a mixed-methods approach incorporating critical play sessions, a survey of 237 boardgame players, and interviews with 18 boardgame designers and publishers, we identified the key functions performed by the digital tools in these games. Using affinity mapping, we grouped these functions into eight core categories, which were tested and refined using a survey of 44 boardgame players and designers. This model defines and classifies the diverse functions that digital tools perform in hybrid digital boardgames, demonstrating their range and potential application for researchers and game designers.},

abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent closure of schools forced families across the globe to transition to school at home. This unprecedented context is likely to have a lasting impact on the practice of schooling and the role of online, digital platforms within school contexts. In this paper we present a contextual inquiry of an ‘emergency home school context’, detailing how nine young families in Melbourne, Australia adapted to the unexpected introduction of school to the home following the government-directed closure of schools. Through an online interview and photo-journal study, we develop an emplaced understanding of the context detailing how the relations between people and places around the home evolved over time. We present five design considerations for digital platforms to support the emergency home school context, placing focus on the fluid roles, relationships and evolving sense of place.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) education reaches only a fraction of young children, in part because CT learning tools often require expensive hardware or fluent literacy. Informed by needfinding interviews, we developed a voice-guided smartphone application leveraging storytelling as a creative activity by which to teach CT concepts to 5- to 8-year-old children. The app includes two storytelling games where users create and listen to stories as well as four CT games where users then modify those stories to learn about sequences, loops, events, and variables. We improved upon the app design through wizard-of-oz testing (N = 28) and iterative design testing (N = 22) before conducting an evaluation study (N = 22). Children were successfully able to navigate the app, effectively learn about the target computing concepts, and, after using the app, children demonstrated above-chance performance on a near transfer CT concept recognition task.},

While the evaluation of these technologies remains a crucial aspect of research in the area, researchers lack guidance in terms of how to evaluate text complexity with DHH readers. Thus, in this work we conduct methodological research to evaluate metrics identified from prior work (including reading speed, comprehension questions, and subjective judgements of understandability and readability) in terms of their effectiveness for evaluating texts modified to be at various complexity levels with DHH adults at different literacy levels. Subjective metrics and low-linguistic-complexity comprehension questions distinguished certain text complexity levels with participants with lower literacy. Among participants with higher literacy, only subjective judgements of text readability distinguished certain text complexity levels. For all metrics, participants with higher literacy scored higher or provided more positive subjective judgements overall.},

abstract = {This paper describes the development of a mobile game application for a visually impaired users using bidirectional sounds. This basic game is based loosely on the Fruit Ninja game where users need to slash the fruits to score by using the swipe gesture on the mobile phone's touch screen. The significance of this development is based on the simple interface to minimize latency due to heavy graphics computation and to utilize the the audio cues so that it will be suitable to be played by users with visual impairments. System Development Life Cycle which is SDLC have been implemented based on the main five phases. Standard System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) was implemented, including the analysis, design, development, testing and evaluation phases to ensure that the game suits the requirement of the targeted users. The project was conducted in three phases - Preliminary Test, Pilot Test and Final Test. 90% among the users of mixed ability were able to play this game and interacted through gestures such as touching and swiping screen of the mobile device. 75% of the users demonstrated that they could play game without depending on visual cues, i.e. only depending on bidirectional sounds (audio cues). It is hoped that this project can be a reference point for the development of mobile apps games for visually impaired users.},

We created a mobile/web application to enable the users to track a broad range of daily activities and feelings in unison. In our 3-week study with 15 participants, the application improved the participants’ self-awareness of their activities, feeling, and the correlation between their activities and feelings. Better self-awareness inspired personalized, self-guided, and holistic behavior change as the participants improved their self-care, daily planning and focus, and emotion regulation. Finally, the participants also developed a healthy and organized habit of self-reflection and even reflected on their holistic well-being and the meaning of having a ‘good day’. Behavior change is usually treated as an external and isolated process but our research shows that tracking a broad range of activities and feelings can inspire self-guided holistic behavior change.},

With the rapid development in AI technologies, there are many opportunities to develop tools that can assist students affected by these problems. Chatbots can serve as a platform for individuals to share their emotions, gain motivation to maintain a healthy lifestyle, and consider professional help. In this paper, we describe the design of our chatbot, named Abot, to encourage students to improve their lifestyle habits and well-being, which are important components to maintaining an optimal mental health. Validation with 25 senior high school students who used Abot for a one-week period showed a positive improvement in their physical well-being, positive change in their social well-being, and positive change in their academic well-being. Students’ evaluation of Abot on a 4-point Likert scale showed an average score of 3.35 on performance, 3.36 on humanity, and 3.68 on affect, which points to perceived user acceptability of the chatbot as a potential tool to help them manage their health and well-being.},

Navigating meaningful peer interactions, generating a sense of belonging, and achieving social presence are all major challenges for MOOC platforms. MOOC users often rely on external social platforms for such connection and peer interaction, however, off-platform networking often distracts participants from their learning. With the intention of resolving this issue, we introduce PeerCollab, a web-based platform that provides affordances to create communities and support meaningful peer interactions, building close-knit groups of learners. We present an initial evaluation through a field study (n=56) over 6 weeks and a controlled experiment (n=22). The result indicates insights on how learners build a sense of belonging and develop peer interactions leading to close-knit learning circles. We find that PeerCollab can provide more meaningful interactions and create a community to bring a culture of social learning to decentralized, and isolated MOOC learners.},

In this work, we propose FacialPen, a prototype that uses facial gestures to trigger commands for pen-based manipulation. In our prototype, a fisheye camera is mounted to the end of a stylus that provides a broad view from which to capture the human face. We facilitated an elicitation study to identify natural and user-defined gestures for interactions with facial expressions. Different gestures can be further discerned via face detection and a classification pipeline. We designed a sketching demonstration application to explore usage scenarios and evaluated the effectiveness of FacialPen through a qualitative study. The user study posits that FacialPen supports efficiency by reducing screen widgets, enabling the continuity of creation work and liberating the user’s stylus holding postures when switching sketch functions.},

abstract = {Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) often lack valuable social presences that provide learners opportunities to interact and to be feel as a real person. This subjective experience of being present with a “real” person and having access to their thoughts and emotions increase the learning experience. Although MOOCs provide forums for such interactions, they are often populated with cognitive types of presence limiting social presence. Meaningful social interactions are challenging in MOOCs due to scale and design limitations. This research presents a conceptual framework of 4 phases: Cluster, Orient, Focus and Network to scaffold better social interaction in MOOCs. The framework introduce a re-design of interactions in MOOC forums space — leverages clustered groups by creating many communities in forums spaces with a community leader facilitating the conversations leading social presence. It also provides a community structure with orientation, focus to work in the community and better networking opportunities. An initial integration of the framework to a real MOOC with 27,554 students provides preliminary results indicating effective scaffolding of social presence in MOOC communities, yet the framework poses challenges relying the social interactions centered upon community manger. However, the study opens new directions to leverage communities in MOOCs and potential to scale.},

abstract = {Nowadays, smartphones have become an inseparable part of students’ life. Many previous studies have explored smartphone usage behavior in different contexts. However, to our best knowledge, smartphone usage behavior of the high and low academic result holders is very less studied. Thus, in the context of Bangladesh, using 7 days’ actual smartphone usage data of high [N=32] and low [N=44] performers, we investigate the smartphone usage of these two groups. Our findings show that low performers are more focused on certain apps of the Launcher category whereas high performers are more focused on certain apps of the Video category. Moreover, we find that low performers’ micro usage and review session number is statistically significantly (p&lt;0.05) higher. Based on different smartphone usage data, our presented machine learning model classifies these two groups of students with 73.33% accuracy. Thus, these findings suggest that high and low performers can be identified through smartphone usage data.},

People aged 50 or older have a death rate of 30 to 220 times that of the 18 to 29 age group.Each country strives to lower the infection rate by quickly providing the public infectious disease information through emergency alert messages. However, existing emergency alerts messaging systems provide redundant precautions. Also, the National Emergency Alert (NEA) messages are sent through the base transceiver station, the area where the actual COVID-19 confirmed case occurred and the area where the message was received do not match. In this paper, we present CO-ALERT, a tool that effectively provides older adults aged 50 or older with NEA messages. We developed CO-ALERT through a design thinking process to suggest solutions that effectively address the needs of potential target users. User-friendly interfaces of CO-ALERT enable older adults to view NEA messages based on their preferences. We hope the findings of this study contribute to a deeper understanding of the experiences of older adults during COVID-19 pandemic.},

Considering rising numbers, over 1.4 million AWWs, and continuously advancing knowledge of community healthcare, conventional training pedagogy is ineffective in building and updating AWWs and their supervisors’ capacity, which calls for rethinking, using the ICT approach. Over 6 lakh AWWs in India were smartphone equipped by 2020. An android based quiz app was designed, following AWWs training modules’ content and need assessment results. The study investigates the quiz app’s effectiveness and compares it with conventional classroom instruction, with a group of AWWs, and discusses ways to make it an adequate substitute.},

Although there is little problem to conduct one-on-one remote conferences, remote group discussion still contains many challenges. One of the main issue is that the remote participants often unnotice the referential action performed by the local participants. To solve such problem, we proposed to develop a function that automatically detects the presence of referential action and displays to the remote participant. One of the issues for this function is about what kind of information of the referential action should be provided and how the information should be displayed. In this research, we conducted a lab study to compare two displaying methods: Picture-in-Picture (PiP) and auto-pilot and compare two displaying contents: object being referred and person performing the referential action. The result shows that the PiP method had higher usability and remote participant had higher opportunity to join the conversation with the PiP method. On the other hand, displaying object being referred had higher usability than displaying the person performing the referential action.},

While prior work has assessed these tools qualitatively, it is still unclear how to quantitatively evaluate reference managers. This paper starts to quantify the user effort required to use reference managers. We first collected surveys from 69 graduate students to understand their experience with reference managers, and then conducted user studies with 12 participants. In our study, each participant was asked to perform a standardized task using four popular reference managers: Mendeley, Zotero, EndNote, and RefWorks. We used RUI, a keystroke and mouse-move logger, to record the participants’ activities and approximate their physical and mental effort. We also used pre- and post-study surveys to collect users’ feedback and self-reported task load (as expressed by the NASA TLX Index.) The results showed that different reference managers require different levels of effort, and users generally prefer the tools that involve less effort. We also found that although reference managers share similar features, differences in presentation and organization matter. We conclude this work by providing a set of guidelines for both users and developers of reference managers.},

During the COVID pandemic, the situation has changed all over where both genders had to rely on and adopt technology for working and financial purposes. Our research is an ongoing research and currently we explored n=20 urban formally working women in Bangladesh to understand how COVID impacts them to adopt technology and technology-based services. These women had comparatively less exploration in digital services before the pandemic. COVID instantly increased their technology adoption significantly. However, COVID grows some negative concerns regarding excessive technology impact on their work-life, kids, and finance. Based on findings, we mention a few design recommendations regarding ways of technology usage that will help women to reduce their excessive technology-adoption concerns and help them to use the technology in better ways.},

abstract = {Advances in conversational interfaces have facilitated the widespread use of chatbots in assisting humans in their daily lives such as in retail services, healthcare, and education. With the use of Natural Language Processing techniques (NLP), chatbots can leverage on storytelling strategies to engage children in meaningful conversations to narrate and share their stories. In this paper, we compared two existing conversational storytelling agents, Orsen and EREN, by analyzing the dialog logs to examine children’s engagement when sharing their stories with these agents. Taking three dimensions - language production, flow maintenance, and affect; into consideration, results show that the ability of EREN to recognize emotions expressed in the child’s input text can encourage the children to be more open to sharing their stories. Even though the agent cannot generate affect-rich responses, its ability to recognize the emotions made children feel thankful and appreciative of the agent for listening.},

The gait data from accelerometer during walking is adopted from developed slipper devices as the personal unique data used for identification. Gait data is processed by Fast Fourier Transform to extract the frequency features and the Support vector machine (SVM) is used to identify the subject. Through assessing the different segmentation window size and various sensor positions, the results showed that an average accuracy was 95.0% using six sensors, and an average accuracy of 93.3% using three sensors placed at optimal positions.},

We conducted a survey to investigate three research questions and further inform the design of computer-related behavior change applications. RQ1: What do people want to change and why/how? RQ2: What applications do people use or have used, why do they work or not, and what additional support is desired? RQ3: What are helpful/unhelpful computer breaks and why? Our survey had 68 participants and three key findings. First, time management is a primary concern, but emotional and physical side-effects are also important. Second, site blockers, self-trackers, and timers are commonly used, but they are ineffective as they are easy-to-ignore and not personalized. Third, away-from-computer breaks, especially involving physical activity, are helpful, whereas on-screen breaks are unhelpful, especially when they are long, because they are not refreshing. We recommend personalized and closed-loop computer-usage behavior change support and especially encouraging off-the-computer computer breaks.},

abstract = {The pandemic in 2020 and the resultant global lockdown led to new dynamics in the homestead. Families faced an accelerated process of digitization of conventional processes like education and white collar jobs. Working women with children of school or kindergarten age were forced to redraw the boundaries between the personal and the professional as the entire family essentially functioned from home, which increased prevalent gender inequalities. Tasks like 'planning', care-giving, emotional care etc. go unaccounted for and remain invisible to other members of the household. We present a feminist design research project that explores how design research can contribute to greater social justice and gender equality by a fairer distribution of domestic labour. We conducted semi-structured interviews in India during the pandemic lockdown, to elicit both explicit as well as tacit information on daily workloads of working women with families. We found disparity in domestic duties between genders, with specific regard to the circumstances created by the 2020 pandemic conditions. Based on our findings and analysis, we prototyped a visualization tool that makes invisible domestic work visible. Our research contribution is a design research methodology to generate insights to enable creation of design interventions for social justice. This was achieved through use of established design research methods, that are conventionally used in face-to-face settings, which were then adapted to exceptional pandemic conditions that required social distancing where communication was remote, and usually virtual.},

abstract = {People with dementia (PwD) have been conducting educational activities to live well with dementia. Appropriate CHI design is needed to support the lives of PwD. However, current prototypical systems are mostly designed for needs on the surface and do not approach hidden needs. To develop an system that PwD wants to use on a daily basis, we conducted a co-production practice with PwD focussing on outing their home. We collaborate with a group of early-onset dementia who wanted their opinions to be reflected in ICT. A participatory design workshop was undertaken to discuss the development of outing assistants. As a result, it was found that they did not want the system to be responsible for intervening in their disabilities, but to positively encourage their activities. To conduct a case study for outing assists, we focused on a person with dementia’s activity to verify whether it contributes to her life. The system was implemented as a voice and visual interaction system, designed to encourage a positive relationship between the supporter and her. Our results indicate that the system design to support PwD should produce positive interaction and should be adapted to the individual context.},

MOOC platforms offer various advantages over traditional education. Still, it is inevitable that there still remain significant challenges that hamper the development and popularity of MOOCs. Interactions and collaborated learning remain as vital weaknesses. In this paper, we are interested in improving MOOC interactions by investigating learners’ experience with current popular MOOC platforms starting with a survey. We also conducted a task analysis on three popular MOOC platforms, Coursera, LinkedIn Learning, and Canvas, to analyze whether and how they include key interaction functions. We found that learner-instructor and teamwork interaction affect users’ experience most. Based on our findings, we propose a set of comprehensive guidelines, called IN-MOOC, to facilitate interpersonal interactions on MOOC platforms. In summary, IN-MOOC provides comprehensive and hierarchical guidelines to improve users’ experience via enhancing interpersonal interaction on MOOC platforms.},

abstract = {Personal Health Record (PHR) is a technology that usually is targeted to people with chronic illness or in the elderly and designed to supplement medical care with health monitoring outside traditional care environments in hospitals such as in person-visits through a mobile application. The widespread adoption and use of PHRs will not occur unless it provides good usability for users. Autoimmune is a condition where an immune system response attacks its host. There are 80+ types of autoimmune diseases. Some autoimmune diseases are life-threatening, and most are debilitating and require a lifetime of treatment. The variability in the development of daily symptoms and the condition of the patients with autoimmune disease increases the need for PHR. Thymun is a mobile application made for people with autoimmune disease and contains PHR as its main feature. In this study, we do a usability evaluation in the previous iteration and also gather the needs and problems that patients have with their traditional way of monitoring their health. After the founded usability problems and new found needs we then redesign the product in the 2nd iteration and then conduct usability evaluation. It was found that the feature with the smallest usability score is symptoms recording. The results of the interview after the test obtained qualitative information about the problems experienced by participants when undergoing the test and the participants’ perceptions as users of the application design when using the prototype. Finally, a post-test survey was carried out using the SUS test instrument, which obtained a usability score of 74. The 2nd iteration has a better satisfaction rate,mission usability score and more positive remarks.},

abstract = {Chatbots are developed using two approaches: rule-based and ML-based. The former has a scripted tree structure consisting of questions and answers, while the latter can understand the intent of a user’s question and generate answers from machine learning. Despite these benefits, each method has drawbacks: rule-based chatbots cannot answer slightly different questions with the same meaning in the patterns, and ML-based chatbots have difficulty performing continuous conversations while keeping the conversation context. We propose the concept of a hybrid chatbot that combines a rule-based chatbot and an ML-based chatbot to overcome the limitations of each. We conducted an exploratory study to investigate how a hybrid chatbot could support a survivor of sexual violence. A total of 349 questions asked from the stance of survivors were collected and analyzed. We found that the most frequently asked questions were about the punishment for sexual violence, the police report, and the list of support centers. Also, 30% of the questions omitted contextual information about sexual violence, and 10% of questions consisted of only keywords, not complete sentences. We suggest two design implications for the hybrid chatbot based on the survey’s findings: 1) dialog flow for helping survivors understand the abuse experience sufficiently to report the sexual violence to police, and 2) contextualization strategies for connecting dialog flow with questions from the survivors.},

Table manipulation, such as cell insertion and removal, is usually performed by selecting a menu command or using shortcut keys. However, the enormous number of shortcut keys makes them difficult to learn and remember. We sought to design a mid-air hand gesture-based interface for table manipulation in spreadsheet applications. As hand gestures and table manipulations are both spatial in nature, there should be a natural mapping between them. In this paper, we performed two user studies to derive a user-defined gesture set allowing 13 types of table manipulation. In the first study, we collected mid-air hand gestures devised by participants for manipulations implemented in existing spreadsheet software. In the second study, we asked other participants to vote for their most preferred gestures. We analyzed the characteristics of the collected gestures and votes, and created a final user-defined gesture set.},

abstract = {The first step toward accessibility improvement in the context of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is the identification of potential barriers. A recent study shows that words that are frequently copied to the clipboard by web users are relatively complex. A plausible reason is that users copy challenging words to search for a translation or more information. Accordingly, tracking word-copying operations of web users may be useful in identifying complex words. This study focuses on the users that apply word-copying. It shows significant differences in the frequency of word-copying operations among different populations of users. On the examined website, whose content is in English, users whose preferred language is not English copied single words to the clipboard significantly more frequently than users whose preferred language is English. Further analysis of the data also shows that word-copying was more frequent among users whose preferred languages have low proximity to English, such as Asian languages, compared to Western European languages. These results support the observation that word-copying indicates complexity, as it is reasonable to expect that native speakers of foreign languages (and especially of languages that are considerably different from the website’s language) are more likely to need help with complex words. Word complexity is subjective and audience-dependent. This study contributes to the understanding of which users tend to use word-copying, and accordingly, in which context word-copying data can be used as a word complexity indicator. It also introduces a new practical approach for detecting language barriers in order to improve language accessibility on global websites.},

Several reachability techniques have been developed to enable users to access such areas, but many of these techniques are designed to enable users to perform only a tap gesture, so other single-touch gestures such as long-tap, double-tap, swipe, and drag cannot be performed. To enable all single-touch gestures for unreachable areas, we designed a hover-based reachability technique that uses a cursor. In addition, we conducted a pilot study to compare user performance with our technique and that of existing techniques, One-Handed Mode (OM) and Event Forward Cursor (EC). The results showed that our technique was faster than EC, which uses the same cursor technique as ours, except for the double-tap gesture when the target was small. However, our technique was slower than OM, which is the technique that shrinks the entire screen. Lastly, we discuss possible improvements of our technique on the basis of the results.},

Unlike other administrative data, these narratives offer a more credible source of information with respect to workers’ interactions with families as well as underscore the role of systemic factors in decision-making. SIGCHI researchers have emphasized the need to understand human discretion at the street-level to be able to design human-centered algorithms for the public sector. In this study, we conducted computational text analysis of casenotes at a child-welfare agency in the midwestern United States and highlight patterns of invisible street-level discretionary work and latent power structures that have direct implications for algorithm design. Casenotes offer a unique lens for policymakers and CW leadership towards understanding the experiences of on-the-ground caseworkers. As a result of this study, we highlight how street-level discretionary work needs to be supported by sociotechnical systems developed through worker-centered design. This study offers the first computational inspection of casenotes and introduces them to the SIGCHI community as a critical data source for studying complex sociotechnical systems.},

Yet, learning movement this way poses challenges: lack of feedback and personalised instructions, and having to rely on personal imitation capacity to learn movements. We address some of these challenges by exploring visual cues’ potential to help people imitate movements from instructional videos. With a Research through Design approach, focused on strength training, we augmented an instructional video with different sets of visual cues: directional cues, body highlights, and metaphorical visualizations. We tested each set with ten practitioners over three recorded sessions, with follow-up interviews. Through thematic analysis, we derived insights on the effect of each set of cues for supporting movement learning. Finally, we generated design takeaways to inform future HCI work on visual cues for instructional training videos.},

abstract = {Contact tracers assist in containing the spread of highly infectious diseases such as COVID-19 by engaging community members who receive a positive test result in order to identify close contacts. Many contact tracers rely on community member’s recall for those identifications, and face limitations such as unreliable memory. To investigate how technology can alleviate this challenge, we developed a visualization tool using de-identified location data sensed from campus WiFi and provided it to contact tracers during mock contact tracing calls. While the visualization allowed contact tracers to find and address inconsistencies due to gaps in community member’s memory, it also introduced inconsistencies such as false-positive and false-negative reports due to imperfect data, and information sharing hesitancy. We suggest design implications for technologies that can better highlight and inform contact tracers of potential areas of inconsistencies, and further present discussion on using imperfect data in decision making.},
