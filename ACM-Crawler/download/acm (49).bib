abstract = {Video game toxicity, endemic to online play, represents a pervasive and complex problem. Antisocial behaviours in online play directly harm player wellbeing, enjoyment, and retention—but research has also revealed that some players normalize toxicity as an inextricable and acceptable element of the competitive video game experience. In this work, we explore perceptions of toxicity and how they are predicted by player traits, demonstrating that participants reporting a higher tendency towards Conduct Reconstrual, Distorting Consequences, Dehumanization, and Toxic Online Disinhibition perceive online game interactions as less toxic. Through a thematic analysis on willingness to report, we also demonstrate that players abstain from reporting toxic content because they view it as acceptable, typical of games, as banter, or as not their concern. We propose that these traits and themes represent contributing factors to the cyclical normalization of toxicity. These findings further highlight the multifaceted nature of toxicity in online video games.},

abstract = {Dance provides unique opportunities for embodied interdisciplinary learning experiences that can be personally and culturally relevant. danceON is a system that supports learners to leverage their body movement as they engage in artistic practices across data science, computing, and dance. The technology includes a Domain Specific Language (DSL) with declarative syntax and reactive behavior, a media player with pose detection and classification, and a web-based IDE. danceON provides a low-floor allowing users to bind virtual shapes to body positions in under three lines of code, while also enabling complex, dynamic animations that users can design working with conditionals and past position data. We developed danceON to support distance learning and deployed it in two consecutive cohorts of a remote, two-week summer camp for young women of color. We present our findings from an analysis of the experience and the resulting computational performances. The work identifies implications for how design can support learners’ expression across culturally relevant themes and examines challenges from the lens of usability of the computing language and technology.},

abstract = {Abstract: Force feedback devices, such as motor-based exoskeletons or wearables based on electrical muscle stimulation (EMS), have the unique potential to accelerate users’ own reaction time (RT). However, this speedup has only been explored while the device is attached to the user. In fact, very little is known regarding whether this faster reaction time still occurs after the user removes the device from their bodies–this is precisely what we investigated by means of a simple reaction time (RT) experiment, in which participants were asked to tap as soon as they saw an LED flashing. Participants experienced this in three EMS conditions: (1) fast-EMS, the electrical impulses were synced with the LED; (2) agency-EMS, the electrical impulse was delivered 40ms faster than the participant’s own RT, which prior work has shown to preserve one’s sense of agency over this movement; and, (3) late-EMS: the impulse was delivered after the participant’s own RT. Our results revealed that the participants’ RT was significantly reduced by approximately 8ms (up to 20ms) only after training with the agency-EMS condition. This finding suggests that the prioritizing agency during EMS training is key to motor-adaptation, i.e., it enables a faster motor response even after the user has removed the EMS device from their body.},

abstract = {Meditation is a mind-body practice with considerable wellbeing benefits that can take different forms. Novices usually start with focused attention meditation that supports regulation of attention towards an inward focus or internal bodily sensations and away from external stimuli or distractors. Most meditation technologies employ metaphorical mappings of meditative states to visual or soundscape representations to support awareness of mind wandering and attention regulation, although the rationale for such mappings is seldom articulated. Moreover, such external modalities also take the focus attention away from the body. We advance the concept of interoceptive interaction and employed the embodied metaphor theory to explore the design of mappings to the interoceptive sense of thermoception. We illustrate this concept with WarmMind, an on-body interface integrating heat actuators for mapping meditation states. We report on an exploratory study with 10 participants comparing our novel thermal metaphors for mapping meditation states with comparable ones, albeit in aural modality, as provided by Muse meditation app. Findings indicate a tension between the highly discoverable soundscape's metaphors which however hinder attention regulation, and the ambiguous thermal metaphors experienced as coming from the body and supported attention regulation. We discuss the qualities of embodied metaphors underpinning this tension and propose an initial framework to inform the design of metaphorical mappings for meditation technologies.},

abstract = {Understanding how and why people share negative emotions and thoughts on social media has received much scholarly attention. Scholars have identified a variety of factors that affect disclosure behavior, but as platforms offer a wider range of affordances that enable more diverse user behaviors and nuanced audience segmentation, these influencing factors are increasingly intertwined. However, little is known about the interrelatedness of platform, affordance, and audience. Drawing on survey data of 470 American adults during the COVID-19 pandemic, this study examines the interplay and relative strength of the factors influencing distress disclosure on social media. We introduce the concept of social media disclosure ecology as an analytical lens to understand online disclosure. The results suggest that perceived affordances (i.e., anonymity, persistence, visibility control) and relational closeness to audience separately and interactively predict the depth of distress disclosure, which in turn affects satisfaction with disclosure. This study contributes to the literature on online-disclosure and privacy, while providing implications for the design of social media to better support people in distress.},

abstract = {Directly manipulating the timeline, such as scrubbing for thumbnails, is the standard way of controlling how-to videos. However, when how-to videos involve physical activities, people inconveniently alternate between controlling the video and performing the tasks. Adopting a voice user interface allows people to control the video with voice while performing the tasks with hands. However, naively translating timeline manipulation into voice user interfaces (VUI) results in temporal referencing (e.g. “rewind 20 seconds”), which requires a different mental model for navigation and thereby limiting users’ ability to peek into the content. We present RubySlippers, a system that supports efficient content-based voice navigation through keyword-based queries. Our computational pipeline automatically detects referenceable elements in the video, and finds the video segmentation that minimizes the number of needed navigational commands. Our evaluation (N=12) shows that participants could perform three representative navigation tasks with fewer commands and less frustration using RubySlippers than the conventional voice-enabled video interface.},

We found that CAs empowered both the people who had MCI, and their care partners. We observed that the utility of the CA in the day-to-day lives of users largely depended on how much the care partner scaffolded promising functionality, setting it up and contextualizing it for specific needs and desires.},

OSCs use algorithms such as machine learning to facilitate self-diagnosis and triage based on symptoms input by healthcare consumers. However, intelligent systems’ lack of transparency and comprehensibility could lead to unintended consequences such as misleading users, especially in high-stakes areas such as healthcare. In this paper, we attempt to enhance diagnostic transparency by augmenting OSCs with explanations. We first conducted an interview study (N=25) to specify user needs for explanations from users of existing OSCs. Then, we designed a COVID-19 OSC that was enhanced with three types of explanations. Our lab-controlled user study (N=20) found that explanations can significantly improve user experience in multiple aspects. We discuss how explanations are interwoven into conversation flow and present implications for future OSC designs.},

abstract = {We propose a nail-mounted foldable haptic device that provides tactile feedback to mixed reality (MR) environments by pressing against the user's fingerpad when a user touches a virtual object. What is novel in our device is that it quickly tucks away when the user interacts with real-world objects. Its design allows it to fold back on top of the user's nail when not in use, keeping the user's fingerpad free to, for instance, manipulate handheld tools and other objects while in MR. To achieve this, we engineered a wireless and self-contained haptic device, which measures 24\texttimes{}24\texttimes{}41&nbsp;mm and weighs 9.5&nbsp;g. Furthermore, our foldable end-effector also features a linear resonant actuator, allowing it to render not only touch contacts (i.e., pressure) but also textures (i.e., vibrations). We demonstrate how our device renders contacts with MR surfaces, buttons, low- and high-frequency textures. In our first user study, we found that participants perceived our device to be more realistic than a previous haptic device that also leaves the fingerpad free (i.e., fingernail vibration). In our second user study, we investigated the participants’ experience while using our device in a real-world task that involved physical objects. We found that our device allowed participants to use the same finger to manipulate handheld tools, small objects, and even feel textures and liquids, without much hindrance to their dexterity, while feeling haptic feedback when touching MR interfaces.},

Despite disparate approaches to incorporating digital tools in otherwise non-digital boardgames, there has to date been no detailed classification of the different roles that these tools play in supporting gameplay. In this paper, we present a model for understanding hybrid boardgame play as performing a set of discrete functions. Through a mixed-methods approach incorporating critical play sessions, a survey of 237 boardgame players, and interviews with 18 boardgame designers and publishers, we identified the key functions performed by the digital tools in these games. Using affinity mapping, we grouped these functions into eight core categories, which were tested and refined using a survey of 44 boardgame players and designers. This model defines and classifies the diverse functions that digital tools perform in hybrid digital boardgames, demonstrating their range and potential application for researchers and game designers.},

abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent closure of schools forced families across the globe to transition to school at home. This unprecedented context is likely to have a lasting impact on the practice of schooling and the role of online, digital platforms within school contexts. In this paper we present a contextual inquiry of an ‘emergency home school context’, detailing how nine young families in Melbourne, Australia adapted to the unexpected introduction of school to the home following the government-directed closure of schools. Through an online interview and photo-journal study, we develop an emplaced understanding of the context detailing how the relations between people and places around the home evolved over time. We present five design considerations for digital platforms to support the emergency home school context, placing focus on the fluid roles, relationships and evolving sense of place.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) education reaches only a fraction of young children, in part because CT learning tools often require expensive hardware or fluent literacy. Informed by needfinding interviews, we developed a voice-guided smartphone application leveraging storytelling as a creative activity by which to teach CT concepts to 5- to 8-year-old children. The app includes two storytelling games where users create and listen to stories as well as four CT games where users then modify those stories to learn about sequences, loops, events, and variables. We improved upon the app design through wizard-of-oz testing (N = 28) and iterative design testing (N = 22) before conducting an evaluation study (N = 22). Children were successfully able to navigate the app, effectively learn about the target computing concepts, and, after using the app, children demonstrated above-chance performance on a near transfer CT concept recognition task.},

While the evaluation of these technologies remains a crucial aspect of research in the area, researchers lack guidance in terms of how to evaluate text complexity with DHH readers. Thus, in this work we conduct methodological research to evaluate metrics identified from prior work (including reading speed, comprehension questions, and subjective judgements of understandability and readability) in terms of their effectiveness for evaluating texts modified to be at various complexity levels with DHH adults at different literacy levels. Subjective metrics and low-linguistic-complexity comprehension questions distinguished certain text complexity levels with participants with lower literacy. Among participants with higher literacy, only subjective judgements of text readability distinguished certain text complexity levels. For all metrics, participants with higher literacy scored higher or provided more positive subjective judgements overall.},

While primarily used for entertainment in the early days, gaming now provides the possibility of countering social isolation and connecting with others through multiplayer games, online gaming communities and game streaming. In our work, we explore how facial expression recognition can be harnessed to provide quadriplegic individuals a way to play games independently and without complex mouth controller devices.

Privilege permeates nearly every facet of human existence and yet we seem to barely recognise its role in what are seemingly impartial outcomes. Tread Together is an interactive narrative based game that uses gameplay as a tool to help people better reflect on their own privilege and examine how it affects the people around them using a combination of critical and reflective design. The narrative transports players to embark on a journey through an alternative perspective in the game with the express intent of introspective contemplation and scrutiny of privilege as a dominant paradigm in society.},

Traditional clinical methods do not often provide adequate and personalized support for these individuals. In this project, we aim to use smart speakers to provide supportive care interventions to improve the quality of life for women with MBC. Specifically, we have developed Nurse AMIE (Addressing Metastatic Individuals Everyday) by leveraging the Amazon Alexa to remotely deliver validated interventions. We believe that voice interactions can significantly lower the barrier to interact with remote intervention technologies for this population. In a pilot study, we deployed Nurse AMIE for 14 days over 6 women with MBC. Based on the collected data, this paper discusses the feasibility, acceptability, and future directions of Nurse AMIE. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to use smart speakers to support women with MBC.},

Foundational qualitative research is necessary to ensure platforms’ misinformation interventions are aligned with users’ needs and understanding of information in their own contexts, across platforms. In two studies, we combined in-depth interviews (n=15) with diary and co-design methods (n=23) to investigate how a mix of Americans exposed to misinformation during COVID-19 understand their information environments, including encounters with interventions such as Facebook fact-checking labels. Analysis reveals a deep division in user attitudes about platform labeling interventions, perceived by 7/15 interview participants as biased and punitive. As a result, we argue for the need to better research the unintended consequences of labeling interventions on factual beliefs and attitudes. Alongside these findings, we discuss our methods as a model for continued independent qualitative research on cross-platform user experiences of misinformation in order to inform interventions.},

We found that information is focused on complying with legal regulations, and puts the responsibility for such decisions on the developer. Also, sample code and settings often have privacy-unfriendly defaults laced with dark patterns to nudge developers’ decisions towards privacy-unfriendly options such as sharing sensitive data to increase revenue. We conclude by discussing future research around empowering developers and minimising the negative impacts of dark patterns.},

Several studies have explored the use of technology to overcome these barriers and to support speech-therapy in children with language impairments (e.g. DLD and ASD). In this paper, we propose a conceptual framework for designing linguistic activities (for assessment and training), based on advances in psycholinguistics. Moving from this theoretical framework, we identified a development process - from the UX design to coding of activities – which is based on a novel set of Design Patterns at multiple layers of abstraction. We then put this framework into practice by implementing these patterns into two technological solutions – tablet and robots – and performing an empirical study to evaluate their benefits. Our results, although still preliminary since they assessed only a tablet experimental condition, are promising for extending the identified Design Patterns to other technological solutions.},

Hence, we aimed to facilitate conversation between the strangers with the use of machine learning (ML) algorithms and present BlahBlahBot, an ML-infused chatbot that moderates conversation between strangers with personalized topics. Based on social media posts, BlahBlahBot supports the conversation by suggesting topics that are likely to be of mutual interest between users. A user study with three groups (control, random topic chatbot, and BlahBlahBot; N=18) found the feasibility of BlahBlahBot in increasing both conversation quality and closeness to the partner, along with the factors that led to such increases from the user interview. Overall, our preliminary results imply that an ML-infused conversational agent can be effective for augmenting a dyadic conversation.},

This analysis motivates rethinking the role of prompts in controlling and evaluating powerful language models. We discuss methods of prompt programming, emphasizing the usefulness of considering prompts through the lens of natural language. We explore techniques for exploiting the capacity of narratives and cultural anchors to encode nuanced intentions and techniques for encouraging deconstruction of a problem into components before producing a verdict. Informed by this more encompassing theory of prompt programming, we also introduce the idea of a metaprompt that seeds the model to generate its own natural language prompts for a range of tasks. Finally, we discuss how these more general methods of interacting with language models can be incorporated into existing and future benchmarks and practical applications.},

abstract = {Responsible conduct of research (RCR) is an essential skill for all researchers to develop, but training scientists to behave ethically is complex because it requires addressing both cognitive (i.e., conceptual knowledge and moral reasoning skills) and socio-affective (i.e., attitudes) learning outcomes. Currently, both classroom- and web-based forms of RCR training struggle to address these distinct types of learning outcomes simultaneously. In this paper, we present a study providing initial evidence that playing a single brief session of &nbsp;Academical, a choice-based interactive narrative game, can significantly improve players’ attitudes about RCR. We further demonstrate the relationship between engagement with the game and resulting attitudes. Combined with our previous work showing &nbsp;Academical’s advantages over traditional RCR training for teaching cognitive learning outcomes, this study’s results highlight that utilizing a choice-based interactive story game is a uniquely effective way to holistically address RCR learning outcomes that drive ethical research behavior.},

abstract = {The effect of removing gamification elements from interactive systems has been a long-standing question in gamification research. Early work and foundational theories raised concerns about the endurance of positive effects and the emergence of negative ones. Yet, nearly a decade later, no work to date has sought consensus on these matters. Here, I offer a rapid review on the state of the art and what is known about the impact of removing gamification. A small corpus of 8 papers published between 2012 and 2020 were found. Findings suggest a mix of positive and negative effects related to removing gamification. Significantly, insufficient reporting, methodological weaknesses, limited measures, and superficial interpretations of “negative” results prevent firm conclusions. I offer a research agenda towards better understanding the nature of gamification removal. I end with a call for empirical and theoretical work on illuminating the effects that may linger after systems are un-gamified.},

abstract = {Although we extensively use routing services in our daily commutes, such systems are yet to be personalized around the user. It often happens that different routes are close in their estimated time of arrival (ETA) while being very different in how they affect the driver’s states. Using traces of a user’s physiological measures, different candidate routes can be ranked based on how they affect users’ well-being. In this research, we introduce the “empathetic routing” framework for providing human-centered routing based on historical biomarkers of the drivers collected through naturalistic settings and by using smart wearable devices. Through this framework, we rank three specific routes between two points in the city of Charlottesville, based on historical driver heart rate data collected through a three-month naturalistic driving study. Additionally, we demonstrate that the proposed framework is capable of finding infrastructural elements in a route that can potentially affect a driver’s well-being.},

abstract = {As online streaming becomes a primary method for music consumption, the various modalities that many people with hearing loss rely on for their enjoyment need to be supported. While visual or tactile representations can be used to experience music in a live event or from a recording, DRM anti-piracy encryption restricts access to audio data needed to create these multimodal experiences for music streaming. We introduce BufferBeats, a toolkit for building multimodal music streaming experiences. To explore the flexibility of the toolkit and to exhibit its potential use cases, we introduce and reflect upon building a collection of technical demonstrations that bring previous and new multimodal music experiences to streaming. Grounding our work in critical theories on design, making, and disability, as well as experiences from a small group of community partners, we argue that support for multimodal music streaming experiences will not only be more inclusive to the deaf and hard of hearing, but it will also empower researchers and hobbyist makers to use streaming as a platform to build creative new representations of music.},

This paper proposes a more direct computational food integration by conceptualizing the notion of “Cyber Food”, accentuating “food as computational artifact”, where food embodies digital computation that can be ultimately consumed and digested by the human body. With this work, we attempt to open a new pathway to enrich human-food interactions beyond the traditional boundaries between the physical (edible) and digital realms.},

In this work, we evaluate the use of a co-presenter agent in the delivery of virtual presentations given over a videoconferencing system, comparing them to presentations given without the agent. We found that participants were satisfied with the co-presenter agent, and those who liked the agent (scoring above the mean on a composite self-report measure of satisfaction) rated the presentations they gave with the agent as having significantly higher quality compared to those given without the agent. There was evidence the agent helped participants feel less nervous about their talks. Interviews confirmed these findings, and identified additional advantages and disadvantages of using co-presenter agents in virtual presentations.},

With the popularity of social networking sites (SNS) steadily increasing, psychological and social sciences have shown great interest in their effects and consequences on humans. In this work, we investigate Facebook using the tools of HCI to find connections between interface features and the concerns raised by these domains. Using an empirical design analysis, we identify interface interferences impacting users’ online privacy. Through a subsequent survey (n = 116), we find usage behaviour changes due to increased privacy concerns and report individual cases of addiction and mental health issues. These observations are the results of a rapidly changing SNS creating a gap of understanding between users’ interactions with the platform and future consequences. We explore how HCI can help close this gap and work towards more ethical user interfaces in the future.},

To develop this skill, the use of agility ladders is a widespread and well-known training method. While drills vary, having a human expert explaining and monitoring the exercises is usually advantageous. So far, only a few approaches to interactive systems for agility ladder training have been presented. In this work, we propose an interactive projection system to support an athlete in performing those drills. To investigate the effects of the location of those projections, we conducted an initial study with twelve participants using qualitative and quantitative methods. We found that while projecting instructions and feedback on the floor was favored, participants who were presented the same information in front of them on a projected screen partially performed better in a subsequent agility assessment.},

Mobile apps for tracing people’s contacts seem effective, but raise public concerns, e.&nbsp;g., about privacy. Hence, they are contested in public discourse. We report a large-scale NLP-supported analysis of people’s comments about the German contact-tracing app on news websites, social media and app stores. We identified prevalent topics, stances, and how commenting developed over time. We found privacy to be among the most debated topics discussed from various perspectives. Commenting peaked at one point in time, when public discourse centered on the potential tracing protocols and their privacy protection. We encourage further research on the link between the public discussions and actual adoption rates of the app.},

Using these recordings, our model can predict the participants’ well-being scores with a mean absolute error of 14%, relative to the self-reported well-being (“ground truth”). Both audio and text features from the recordings, especially, MFCC and semantic features, are important for prediction accuracy. Based on the work, we provide suggestions for future research to further improve the prediction result.},

abstract = {The use of multi-rotor drones has grown exponentially as a consumer product and in the commercial sector. The inescapable reality is that drones will become a ubiquitous part of society. One major obstacle to the mainstream acceptance of drones is the public perception of drones being dangerous or a safety hazard. This paper presents an investigation into the human factors toward potential drone collisions. The study included twenty participants who underwent a controlled drone collision exposure and a post-exposure interview. We propose a novel drone collision exposure involving a novel experimental setup simulating drone to human collisions safely. We found that all participants identified the drone’s propellers as their primary concern, with the propeller’s sound being the most threatening. Based on the participant feedback, we identified some concerns on a drone’s unregulated aspects and outline common participant recommendations on drone regulations.},

In this study, we aimed to investigate the player’s bereavement process while playing the commercial death-themed game Spiritfarer. Through a thematic analysis of qualitative in-depth interviews with 6 participants, we found that the player’s grieving experience closely resembled the Dual Process Model of Coping with Bereavement by Stroebe and Schut. In the game, players oscillated between facing loss-orientation stressors (‘Character resemblance to the deceased’, ‘Sending characters away’) and restoration-orientation stressors (‘Taking care of remaining spirits’). Through this process, the participants coped with and sometimes reappraised their loss. We further found that the players bereavement experience and level of engagement greatly varied depending on their ‘prior loss experience’, ‘gaming environment’ and ‘tendency to focus on self or game’. Those differences were partly accommodated by the game through its complex and diverse characters and engaging game elements. We conclude with insights for future works in game design for bereavement support.},

We designed a virtual garage, where pairs of same (C1) and mixed (C2) gender repair cars collaboratively. We evaluated the interaction using a collaboration questionnaire adopted from Team Effective Questionnaire (TEQ). Our results show that same-gender pairs were perceived as more productive and supportive. We envision that our work aids developers and researchers in enhancing the collaboration quality by supporting group cohesion and positive interactions.},
