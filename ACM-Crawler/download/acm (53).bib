abstract = {While designing an HCI experiment, planning the sample size with a priori power analysis is often skipped due to the lack of reference effect sizes. On the one hand, it can lead to a false-negative result, missing the effect that is present in the population. On the other hand, it poses a risk of spending more resources if the number of participants is too high. In this work, I present the reference for small, medium, and large effect sizes for typing experiments based on a meta-analysis of well-cited papers from CHI conference. This effect size ruler can be used to conduct a priori power analysis or assess the magnitude of the found effect. This work also includes comparisons to other fields and conclude with a discussion of the existing issues with reporting practices and data availability.

Uniform sensor position normally cannot satisfy the user’s demand according to different conditions. In this paper, we recognized the sensor position as an interface between the user and sensor system. We designed the optimization scheme to generate the best sensor position for activity recognition system. The user can indicate his/her preferred or disliked position and sensor numbers and the proposed optimization evaluates which position or positions combination can generate best accuracy under user’s preference. With the experiment, the proposed scheme can be employed to discover the optimal position to help the HAR system in a simple and customized way.},

abstract = {Thermal comfort is an important factor in building control, affecting occupant health, satisfaction, and productivity. Building management systems in commercial spaces commonly operate on predefined temperature setpoints and control strategies. Many systems target aggregated cohort comfort and neglect to consider the individual occupant’s thermal preferences, leading to high dissatisfaction rates. While recent studies focus on personalized comfort models, such systems mainly operate on occupant preference prediction and do not investigate the reasons for discomfort. This paper presents TREATI’s human-in-the-loop decision-making process. TREATI is a framework that targets thermal comfort conflict resolution in shared spaces using rationale management techniques while considering both individual and cohort comfort. TREATI uses several levels of abstraction separating device management, event processing, context, and rationale management. This separation allows users to adapt the framework to existing building management systems to provide fair decision-making.},

Users’ lacking comprehension of these practices voids any claim of informed consent. Market forces specifically designed these consent notices in their favor to increase users’ consent rates. Some sites even ignore users’ decisions entirely, which results in a mere theatrical performance of consent procedures designed to appear as if it fulfills legal requirements. Improving users’ online privacy cannot rely on individuals’ consent alone. We have to look for complementary approaches as well. Current online data practices are driven by powerful market forces whose interests oppose users’ privacy expectations – making turnkey solutions difficult. Nevertheless, we provide a bird’s-eye view on privacy-improving approaches beyond individuals’ consent.},

Researchers have created animal personas to represent nonhuman animals as stakeholders in design efforts. However neither human nor animal personas allow for the representation of broader-scale ecological impacts in design decisions. To address this gap, we present an additional conceptual tool for design: the ecosystema. This design construct is analogous to a persona, but at the level of an entire ecosystem rather than of a particular human population or animal species. These constructs could allow ecosystem-wide impacts to influence design processes more effectively, and may provide greater leverage on current environmental crises than existing human-centered techniques.},

Yet this model has limitations, such as representing diverse human experiences as a singular point of “the present” and implicitly embedding notions of linear progress. Responding to this, we argue that a plurality of perspectives is needed to engage imaginations that depict a diverse unfolding of potential futures. Through reflecting on our own cultural and professional backgrounds, we offer five perspectives for design futuring as a contribution to this plurality: Parallel Presents, “I Am Time”, Epithelial Metaphors, the Uncertainties Cone, and Meet (with) “Speculation”. These perspectives open alternative approaches to design futuring, move outside prevalent notions of technological progress, and foreground interdependent, relational agencies.},

Traditionally when in need, people can get help from human assistants to complete these thinking tasks, yet, such human experts are not always accessible. Intelligent agents, such as physical robots and virtual chatbots, are promising alternatives to the human assistants in these tasks. My doctoral research focuses on designing intelligent agents to assist human users and evaluating the impact of their interaction mechanisms (i.e., way of behaving) on user experience. Specifically, my works surround this theme by proposing: 1) an anticipation-autonomy framework that models the service robot’s proactivity in decision-making support contexts (decision-making); 2) a bot assistant that helps users to solve the problem of writing poor-quality comments in online mental health communities either by assessing the writing performance or recommending writing examples (problem-solving); and 3) a chatbot in comparison to a non-conversational tool for facilitating people to read academic papers critically (critical thinking). My dissertation contributes to the design of intelligent agents for helping people in high-level thinking tasks and insights for developing appropriate interaction mechanisms for these agents in the future.},

The sheer volume and tendency of misinformation to exploit people’s cognitive biases have eroded the public’s trust in media outlets, governmental institutions, and the democratic process. With Human-Computer Interaction being at the forefront of designing and developing user-facing computing systems, we bear special opportunities to address these issues and work on solutions to mitigate problems arising from misinformation. This workshop brings together designers, developers, and thinkers across disciplines to redefine computing systems by focusing on technologies and applications that instil and nurture critical thinking in their users. By focusing on the problem of misinformation and users’ cognitive security, this workshop will sketch out blueprints for systems and interfaces that contribute to advancing technology and media literacy, building critical thinking skills, and helping users telling fake from truth.},

This workshop will provide a forum to share experiences and challenges of developing AI/ML health and social wellbeing technologies with/for marginalized people and will work towards developing design methods to engage in the re-envisioning of AI/ML technologies for and with marginalized people. In doing so we will create cross-research area dialogues and collaborations.

abstract = {Automation is transforming traditional workplaces and work processes tremendously. While automated systems are no longer restricted to manufacturing environments but pervade various work domains in manifold appearances, automation initiatives and research are still driven from a technology and performance perspective. The goal of this workshop is to provide an interdisciplinary forum for automation-focused user experience research. It will bring together researchers and practitioners from different disciplines to create and transfer knowledge on automation experiences of skilled workers and professionals at workplaces across domains. In a keynote talk, participant presentations, and the group-wise drafting of research ideas, the workshop will address three recent main challenges: encountering workplace automation, collaborating as well as building meaningful relationships with workplace automation. The outcome of this workshop will be a research agenda consisting of ideas for promising future research on automation experiences at the workplace.},

abstract = {Competitive esports is a growing worldwide phenomenon now rivaling traditional sports, with over 450 million views and 1 billion US dollars in revenue each year. For comparison, Major League Baseball has 500 million views and $10 billion in revenue, FIFA Soccer 900 million and $1.6 billion. Despite this significant popularity, much of the world remains unaware of esports — and in particular, research on and for esports is still extremely scarce compared to esports’ impact and potential. The Esports and High Performance HCI (EHPHCI) workshop will begin addressing that research gap. In esports, athletes compete through the computer interface. Because this interface can make the difference between winning and losing, esports athletes are among the most expert computer interface users in the world, as other athletes are experts in using balls and shoes in traditional sports. The premise of this workshop is that people will apply esports technology broadly, improving performance in a wide range of human activity. The workshop will gather experts in engineering, human factors, psychology, design and the social and health sciences to discuss this deeply multidisciplinary enterprise.},

abstract = {HCI has become especially interested in the promises and challenges of user experience of AI, such as user acceptance, human-agent teamwork, and accessibility. Less discussed, however, is that the field of HCI routinely grapples with such challenges; across the various technologies commonly referred to as AI (e.g., predictive modeling, computer vision, NLP), what shared characteristics made human-AI interaction appeared uniquely difficult to design in the first place? Synthesizing my hands-on design and research over the past six years, in my dissertation, I worked to articulate whether, why, and how human-AI interaction appears uniquely challenging to design with established HCI methods. In this extended abstract, I first describe a human-AI interaction design framework as an answer to this question. I then discuss one critical implication of this framework: Framing data-driven AI systems as living socio-technical systems that co-evolve with their users. I analogize this reframing to the shift from desktop computing to ubiquitous computing and outline the ethnographic, design, and technological research opportunities it reveals.},

abstract = {Many users take advantage of digital self-control tools to self-regulate their device usage through interventions such as timers and lockout mechanisms. One of the major challenges faced by these tools is the user reacting against their self-imposed constraints and abandoning the tool. Although lower-risk interventions would reduce the likelihood of abandonment, previous research on digital self-control tools has left this area of study relatively unexplored. In response, this paper contributes two foundational principles relating risk and effectiveness; four widely applicable novel design patterns for reducing risk of abandonment of digital self-control tools (continuously variable interventions, anti-aging design, obligatory bundling of interventions, and intermediary control systems); and a prototype digital self-control tool that implements these four low-risk design patterns.},

To make machine information explicit, we present Taxon, a machine specification language broad enough to represent many machines, while also allowing for enough expressivity to meaningfully compare and infer performance. We describe and detail the motivation behind the design of Taxon, as well as how Taxon programs compile to a simulation of physical machines.

However, most of these support structures are not very compliant, so effortless custom fitting becomes a unique design challenge. Furthermore, the weight and space needed to transport these structures impede adoption in mobile environments. Here, we introduce ExoForm, a compact, customizable, and semi-rigid wearable material system with self-fusing edges that can semi-autonomously assemble on-demand while providing integrated sensing, control, and mobility. We present a comprehensive and holistic engineering strategy that includes optimized material composition, computationally-guided design and fabrication, semi-autonomous self-morphing assembly and fusing steps, heating control, and sensing for our easy-to-wear ExoForm. Finally, we fabricate wearable braces using the ExoForm method as a demonstration along with preliminary evaluation of ExoForm's performance.},

abstract = {Music is a universal medium that can elicit strong emotion, and can significantly help us in gaining focus while doing specific tasks. However, it is unclear what types of music can help to improve focus while doing other activities. In this paper, we investigate the effects of six different music stimuli on participants’ verbal and physiological responses while identifying genuine and acted emotions from video clips. Initial analysis was conducted on the comments participants made on the different stimuli in order to identify emerging patterns. Then, participants’ verbal and EEG responses were collected, processed and analyzed to classify two types of emotion. Empirical analysis of the results show that binaural beats, which are believed to increase focus on tasks, can often cause discomfort and therefore hinder focus. On the other hand, music containing a sombre tone, or familiar popular music with high level valence can help improve focus. Identifying which music stimuli can improve focus can be highly beneficial in managing day-to-day tasks and activities. This study will also be useful in broadening the range of music stimuli used in affective computing studies.},

abstract = {Advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), especially the stunning achievements of Deep Learning (DL) in recent years, have shown AI/DL models possess remarkable understanding towards the logic reasoning behind the solved tasks. However, human understanding towards what knowledge is captured by deep neural networks is still elementary and this has a detrimental effect on human’s trust in the decisions made by AI systems. Explainable AI (XAI) is a hot topic in both AI and HCI communities in order to open up the blackbox to elucidate the reasoning processes of AI algorithms in such a way that makes sense to humans. However, XAI is only half of human-AI interaction and research on the other half - human’s feedback on AI explanations together with AI making sense of the feedback - is generally lacking. Human cognition is also a blackbox to AI and effective human-AI interaction requires unveiling both blackboxes to each other for mutual sensemaking. The main contribution of this paper is a conceptual framework for supporting effective human-AI interaction, referred to as interactive and continuous sensemaking (HAICS). We further implement this framework in an image classification application using deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifiers as a browser-based tool that displays network attention maps to the human for explainability and collects human’s feedback in the form of scribble annotations overlaid onto the maps. Experimental results using a real-world dataset has shown significant improvement of classification accuracy (the AI performance) with the HAICS framework.},

Different researchers have measured the quality of the user's experience through AR. However, here we focused not only on user experience but also on the impact of AR on brand recall and recognition. We analyzed the impact on brand recall and recognition of an AR application by comparing three contexts: a traditional context where participants look at three products, a focused context where participants have only one product to look at, and a technology-enhanced context where participants interacted with the product using the designed AR experience. Experimental results revealed that AR improved brand recall and recognition by creating an engaging environment. Moreover, participants in the AR context recalled additional information about the product. Also, the AR experience motivated them to participate in an omnichannel activity based on a QR interaction. These results show the influence of well-designed AR experiences on brand recall and recognition opening the possibility for new technology in retail environments.},

To find a way to counter this problem, we propose a virtual reality training simulation. The corresponding use case is exemplified by a priming procedure of a dialysis machine. This is achieved by users going through sequential interaction tasks in Virtual Reality Training using a head-mounted display. We evaluate this training method’s potential within a user study, comparing it to traditional training methods, Group Training, and Video Training. Our findings demonstrate that Virtual Reality Training using a head-mounted display is a more effective and efficient method of learning how to prime a dialysis machine. Compared to other training methods, Virtual Reality Training takes longer on average, but the resulting learning effect is also higher. Furthermore, VR-training is more cost-effective than personal training and can be repeatedly performed as it dispenses with the need for teaching professionals.},

abstract = {Explanations in Human-AI Interaction are communicated to human decision makers through interfaces. Yet, it is not clear what consequences the exact representation of such explanations as part of decision support systems (DSS) and working on machine learning (ML) models has on human decision making. We observe a need for research methods that allow for measuring the effect different eXplainable AI (XAI) interface designs have on people’s decision making. In this paper, we argue for adopting research approaches from decision theory for HCI research on XAI interface design. We outline how we used estimation tasks in human-grounded design research in order to introduce a method and measurement for collecting evidence on XAI interface effects. To this end, we investigated representations of LIME explanations in an estimation task online study as proof-of-concept for our proposal.},

It is considered a difficult task for an autonomous robot to be a salesperson. In this paper, we propose the use of a teleoperated robot with a human operator for sales purposes. We conducted an exploratory field experiment in which we built a sales booth in a shopping mall and used our teleoperated robot as the salesperson to promote the sales of toothbrushes. We found that our robot has the ability to attract people’s attention and influence their shopping behavior. Furthermore, we discuss the research challenges in designing and applying teleoperated robots to real sales situations.},

Here, we present Causeworks, a visual analytics application for OD teams to collaboratively build causal models of environments and use analytics to understand and find solutions to affect them. Collaborative causal modelling can help teams craft better plans, but there are unique challenges in developing synchronous collaboration tools for building and using causal models. Collaboration systems typically organize information around varying degrees of synchronization between data “values” and user “views.” Our contribution is in extending this collaboration framework to include analytics as layers that are by nature derived from the data values but utilized and displayed temporarily as private views. We describe how Causeworks overlays analytics inputs and outputs over a shared causal model to flexibly support multiple modeling tasks simultaneously in a collaborative environment with minimal state management burden on users.},

abstract = {In the field of sports, visually impaired spectators are unfortunately at a disadvantage in terms of understanding the precise developments of a game. To provide such information to them, making play-by-play announcements of the live coverage of the game is the best approach; however, this is infeasible as it is difficult to employ a professional commentator for every game. Therefore, this study proposes a blind football play-by-play system, combining a tactile graphic display function and a position acquisition function, to aid visually impaired spectators understand game developments. To conduct a basic study, an experimental system was developed herein, which detects the positions of the players and ball using image processing technology and deep learning, and shows these positions via a refreshable tactile display. The validity of the proposed system was then established through subjective experiments. This system provides a rich user experience to the spectators as well as being a powerful feedback tool to the players. Moreover, an audio–tactile graphic system, which can be used to overcome tactile cognitive limitations, can be implemented as an application of the system in the future.},

But, what if it is an AI doctor and not human? Since AI systems are driven by personalization algorithms, it is possible to design AI doctors that can individuate patients with great precision. Is this appreciated or perceived as eerie and intrusive, thereby negatively affecting doctor-patient interaction? We decided to find out by designing a healthcare chatbot that identified itself as AI, Human, or Human assisted by AI. In a user study assessing Covid-19 risk, participants interacted twice, 10 days apart, with a bot that either individuated them or not. Data show that individuation by an AI doctor lowers patient compliance. Surprisingly, a majority of participants in the human doctor condition thought that they chatted with an AI doctor. Findings provide implications for design of healthcare chat applications.},

abstract = {Prior game researchers mostly focused on designing the ”macro” context which requires a decent proportion of time to engage and play, from which players may benefit. However, the demanding time and effort restrict playability during working hours. To our knowledge, there is little research exploring game design in a manner that enables momentary detachment from primary work for a mind refreshment and effortlessly resumes the suspended work after playing. In this paper, we propose a novel micro-game concept that enables the gamification of micro-breaks within working hours. To examine our concept, we adapted a conventional water-ring game into an interactive prototype, InterRings, which empowers users to play with handy objects. Our mixed observational studies and interviews revealed high acceptability and feasibility of the micro-game concept. Conclusively, three design guidelines are summarised for future development of micro-games.},

These paintings are abstracted based on the distance of the user from the device, and are sent between two portals that can be placed anywhere in the world. We deployed the Painting Portals during a week-long field study investigating how a distance-separated mother and daughter experienced the use of the Painting Portals. We generated recommendations for future design and research, including: (1) stylizing the paintings in a way that better captures emotion/sentiment, (2) placing multiple Painting Portals in different common areas throughout a home, (3) incorporating a video call feature into the Painting Portals, and (4) adding the option to turn off one’s camera for more privacy.},

Plug load management systems (PLMS), in particular, are applications of such systems targeting electrical devices found in homes and workplaces. While past studies have mostly focused on PLMS adoption in homes, past literature indicates several key differences in user motivation as office users typically do not bear the cost of their consumption. This reduces their motivation to embrace such systems, resulting in low adoption rates. In our research, we examined user perception of adopting PLMS in the workplace through a series of focus group discussions and an online survey guided by findings from the focus group discussions. By analysing the quantitative and qualitative responses from 101 participants, we identified six design implications to guide the development of future PLMS in the workplace.},

Yet, how to measure the user experience (UX) of voice-based systems remains an open and urgent question, especially given that their form factors and interaction styles tend to be non-visual, intangible, and often considered disembodied or “body-less.” As a first step, we surveyed the ACM and IEEE literatures to determine which quantitative measures and measurements have been deemed important for voice UX. Our findings show that there is little consensus, even with similar situations and systems, as well as an overreliance on lab work and unvalidated scales. In response, we offer two high-level descriptive frameworks for guiding future research, developing standardized instruments, and informing ongoing review work. Our work highlights the current strengths and weaknesses of voice UX research and charts a path towards measuring voice UX in a more comprehensive way.},

One factor that may contribute to this is the willingness of staff to use VR as part of the social program offered in aged care homes. Therefore, we need to understand staff perceptions of VR programs, especially suggestions for improvement. In an analysis of responses from 10 staff working in residential aged care (also known as nursing homes), we found that staff have concerns about the suitability of VR for older people with cognitive impairments and mobility restrictions. Many older adults living in aged care have these conditions. Our findings suggest that providing staff with training on how to facilitate various kinds of valuable VR experiences and providing a clear picture of its benefits and drawbacks will help to make it suitable for people living in aged care. Furthermore, there should be greater investment in technological infrastructure and co-design of VR in aged care.},

Visualizing the corresponding items from the real world, the user can determine the sensor’s placement arbitrarily and obtain accuracy feedback as well as the classifier interface to get relief from the cost of a conventional training model. With the cases validation, the classifier trained by simulated sensor data can effectively recognize the real-world activity.},

abstract = {To protect the password from visual attacks, most password entry screens use a password masking scheme that displays a series of placeholder characters (e.g., dots and asterisks) instead of the actual password. Recent research has however shown the security provided by this form of password masking to be weak against keystroke timing-analytics attacks. The underlying idea behind these attacks is that, even when a password is masked as described above, the timing between consecutive placeholder characters gives away information about the password since the relative locations of characters on the keyboard dictate how fast fingers move between them. In this paper we argue that, for security-sensitive applications, password masking mechanisms ought to hide the true intervals between password characters in order to overcome these kinds of attacks. Making adjustments to these timings however has the potential to pose usability issues given the fact that the typing would not perfectly align with the display of typed content. The paper proposes 3 different password masking schemes and undertakes a usability evaluation on them. Our early results suggest that user receptiveness to two of the schemes is not much worse than that seen with the conventional (insecure) scheme.},

Simultaneously, however, direct haptic feedback is lost, eliminating an important aspect that we are familiar with from real-life interaction. We believe that smartwatches, as widely used personal devices, could provide a platform for accessible, flexible, and unobtrusive integration of haptic feedback into mid-air gesture interaction. We prototyped a vibrotactile wrist band with four vibration actuators aiming at communicating invisible, undetectable virtual object properties such as electricity, weight, and tension into 3D haptic experiences. In this paper, we present findings from a user study (n=18) that examined the suitability of different vibration patterns (variation in intensity, temporal profile, rhythm, and location). Results show that all feedback variants have a positive impact on user experience (UX) when interacting with virtual objects. Constant, continuous patterns outweigh the other variants examined.},
