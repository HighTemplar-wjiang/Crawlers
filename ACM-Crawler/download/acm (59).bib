abstract = {The privacy of personal data is a human right that is systematically violated in the computing industry, according to human rights organisations. The vision that technology would help society progress through more computing and more accumulation of personal data is now 30 years old. With the knowledge of today, such a vision would be different. Instead of violating a human right, technologists could use data minimisation as a central pillar of innovation. A compelling amount of evidence shows that the majority of consumers does not feel comfortable with being tracked or profiled. This paper analyses how this vision may be realised through a variety of projects and case examples. The conclusion is that technology without tracking, personal data collection, or personal data analysis, may gradually emerge as the dominant mode of innovation and computing over the next 30 years.},

Myoelectric-powered can be more functional and advantageous compared to passive or body-powered prostheses, however extensive training is required to take full advantage of the myoelectric prosthesis’ usability. In recent years, computer technology has brought new opportunities for improving patients’ training, resulting in more usable and functional solutions. Virtual Reality (VR) is a representative example of this type of technology. These preliminary findings suggested that myoelectric-powered training enhanced with VR can simulate a pain-free, natural, enjoyable, and realistic experience for the patient. It was also suggested that VR can complement prosthesis training, by improving the functionality of the missing body part. Finally, it was shown that VR can resolve one of the most common challenges for a new prosthesis user, which is to accept the fitting of the prosthetic device to their own body.},

Our approach combines an Information Systems Research (ISR) framework with the qualitative methodology of Rapid Assessment Process (RAP) to 1) guide app development and 2) include end-users into the design process in a meaningful way. The ISR framework is known in the HCI community but is rarely applied to the domain of mHealth applications, while RAP is a fast, cost-effective process for gaining insight into a situation from an insider’s perspective. This case study mainly focuses on our team’s experience with RAP to explore the mHealth needs and design preferences of members of the military community through a series of end-user interviews conducted by a community “insider”. Findings from our work support the use of combining the ISR framework with RAP as a process for designing future mHealth apps and understanding the unique needs and design preferences of groups of specific end-users.},

abstract = {This study tested two different approaches for adding an explainability feature to the implementation of a legal text summarization solution based on a Deep Learning (DL) model. Both approaches aimed to show the reviewers where the summary originated from by highlighting portions of the source text document. The participants had to review summaries generated by the DL model with two different types of text highlights and with no highlights at all. The study found that participants were significantly faster in completing the task with highlights based on attention scores from the DL model, but not with highlights based on a source attribution method, a model-agnostic formula that compares the source text and summary to identify overlapping language. The participants also reported increased trust in the DL model and expressed a preference for the attention highlights over the other type of highlights. This is because the attention highlights had more use cases, for example, the participants were able to use them to enrich the machine-generated summary. The findings of this study provide insights into the benefits and the challenges of selecting suitable mechanisms to provide explainability for DL models in the summarization task.},

abstract = {People are increasingly encountering robots in public spaces. To increase the robustness of such in-the-wild robotic applications and to achieve their designed outcomes, existing research focuses on improving the technical reliability of robots and identifying effective strategies to prevent or recover from technical failures. However, in human-robot interaction (HRI), a user’s perception of a robot failure may not necessarily relate to technical issues. We focus on understanding users’ perception of robot behaviours and interactions within the context of a public space. In our exploratory study using a novel participatory design methodology, participants designed robot behaviours for applications in public spaces, and tested their design both in a simulator and on the physical robot. We investigate how participants’ perception and expectations change during this iterative participatory prototyping process, especially when the robot exhibits erratic or unexpected behaviours. Our work provides insights on users’ perception of robot failures, and how users’ design of robot behaviours shifts as they observe the robot within the spatial and social context.},

abstract = {We present a new device designed for field studies which have the goal of assessing the perception of overcrowding in nature experiences, with a special focus on areas subjected to mass tourism (pre COVID-19). The design of the device resulted from an interdisciplinary approach attempting to mix valuable techniques from User Experience exploratory research, with the typical way of conducting overcrowding investigations in outdoors and wild areas. We began by reframing both nature and overcrowding as experiences and defining overcrowding as a disturbance to the nature experience. This lead to a new idea for a more beneficial investigation of visitor’s perception, which is moment-to-moment and in context. The device supports recording someone’s subjective perception of overcrowding in space and time, with minimal task load or distraction from the nature experience. The streamlined design affords only two buttons with competing functionalities: one to signal “there are too many people at the park” and another for “the park is too empty”. The device continuously records time, location, and press-down button events, storing everything locally and anonymously, within the boundaries of European GDPR. We applied our method to a field study at the \TH{}ingvellir National Park in Iceland, both a protected area and a UNESCO World Heritage. We then analyzed the collected data and visualized where and when the visitors reported overcrowding. Initial results indicate that by complementing traditional questionnaires with moment-to-moment self-reporting, we could successfully estimate the disturbance from overcrowding over time and place, thus producing a deeper insight into the quality of the experience than questionnaires alone. Our results also speak of some intrinsic qualities of the outdoor infrastructure. The outcome has the potential to make park managers, designers, landscape architects and rangers more capable of understanding the complex interrelation between infrastructure and visitor flow, thus contributing towards the goals of a long-term sustainable management of the area.},

abstract = {In recent years, privacy and data rights have garnered growing attention in public discourse, policy making, and scholarly research. New data protection laws are being rolled out globally to codify data rights and ensure individual control over how personal data is shared and used. This evolving landscape presents several opportunities and challenges for healthcare. In this case study, we outline a design research agenda that emerged from the practical needs of an open source community focused on digital health software for community health in low- and middle-income countries. We situate this case study in the global landscape of data regulations, and the call for responsible data practices that go above and beyond regulatory compliance. We share findings from the formative stages of our multi-stage design process, which include a scoping literature review and a reframing of institutional policies and procedures. A primary contribution of our case study is that it offers an example of the institutional ‘pre-work’ necessary to make sense of the complex data protection landscape, and to chart a path forward for designing software that better supports responsible data practices. This case study also articulates the important role for digital health designers and implementers in operationalizing patient data rights.},

abstract = {Input devices, such as buttons and sliders, are the foundation of any interface. The typical user-centered design workflow requires the developers and users to go through many iterations of design, implementation, and analysis. The procedure is inefficient, and human decisions highly bias the results. While computational methods are used to assist various design tasks, there has not been any holistic approach to automate the design of input components. My thesis proposed a series of Computational Input Design workflows: I envision a sample-efficient multi-objective optimization algorithm that cleverly selects design instances, which are instantly deployed on physical simulators. A meta-reinforcement learning user model then simulates the user behaviors when using the design instance upon the simulators. The new workflows derive Pareto-optimal designs with high efficiency and automation. I demonstrate designing a push-button via the proposed methods. The resulting designs outperform the known baselines. The Computational Input Design process can be generalized to other devices, such as joystick, touchscreen, mouse, controller, etc.},

abstract = {While the accuracy of Natural Language Processing (NLP) models has been going up, users have more expectations than captured by just accuracy. Despite practitioners’ attempt to inspect model blind spots or lacking capabilities, the status-quo processes can be ad-hoc and biased. My thesis focuses on helping practitioners organize and explore the inputs and outputs of their models, such that they can gain more systematic insights into their models’ behaviors. I identified two building blocks that are essential for informative analysis: (1) to scale up the analysis by grouping similar instances, and (2) to isolate important components by generating counterfactuals. To support multiple analysis stages (training data assessment, error analysis, model testing), I designed various interactive tools that instantiate these two building blocks. In the process, I characterized the design space of grouping and counterfactual generation, seeking to balance the machine powers and practitioners’ domain expertise. My future work proposes to explore how the grouping and counterfactual techniques can benefit non-experts in the data collection process.},

abstract = {Space travel and becoming an interplanetary species have always been part of human’s greatest imagination. Research in space exploration helps us advance our knowledge in fundamental sciences, and challenges us to design new technology and create new industries for space. However, keeping a human healthy, happy and productive in space is one of the most challenging aspects of current space programs. Our biological body, which evolved in the earth specific environment, can barely survive by itself in space’s extreme conditions with high radiation, low gravity, etc. This is similar for the moons and planets in the solar system that humans plan to visit. Therefore, researchers have been developing different types of human-computer interfaces systems that support humans’ physical and mental performance in space. With recent advancements in aerospace engineering, and the democratized access to space through aerospace tech startups such as SpaceX, Blue Origin, etc., space research is becoming more plausible and accessible. Thus, there is an exciting opportunity for researchers in HCI to contribute to the great endeavor of space exploration by designing new types of interactive systems and computer interfaces that can support humans living and working in space and elsewhere in the solar system.},

abstract = {Immersive media is becoming increasingly common in day-to-day scenarios: from extended reality systems to multimodal interfaces. Such ubiquity opens an opportunity for building more inclusive environments for users with disabilities (permanent, temporary, or situational) by either introducing immersive and multimodal elements into existing applications, or designing and creating immersive applications with inclusivity in mind. Thus the aim of this workshop is to create a discussion platform on intersections between the fields of immersive media, accessibility, and human-computer interaction, outline the key current and future problems of immersive inclusive design, and define a set of methodologies for design and evaluation of immersive systems from inclusivity perspective.},

abstract = {This paper describes the development of a mobile game application for a visually impaired users using bidirectional sounds. This basic game is based loosely on the Fruit Ninja game where users need to slash the fruits to score by using the swipe gesture on the mobile phone's touch screen. The significance of this development is based on the simple interface to minimize latency due to heavy graphics computation and to utilize the the audio cues so that it will be suitable to be played by users with visual impairments. System Development Life Cycle which is SDLC have been implemented based on the main five phases. Standard System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) was implemented, including the analysis, design, development, testing and evaluation phases to ensure that the game suits the requirement of the targeted users. The project was conducted in three phases - Preliminary Test, Pilot Test and Final Test. 90% among the users of mixed ability were able to play this game and interacted through gestures such as touching and swiping screen of the mobile device. 75% of the users demonstrated that they could play game without depending on visual cues, i.e. only depending on bidirectional sounds (audio cues). It is hoped that this project can be a reference point for the development of mobile apps games for visually impaired users.},

We created a mobile/web application to enable the users to track a broad range of daily activities and feelings in unison. In our 3-week study with 15 participants, the application improved the participants’ self-awareness of their activities, feeling, and the correlation between their activities and feelings. Better self-awareness inspired personalized, self-guided, and holistic behavior change as the participants improved their self-care, daily planning and focus, and emotion regulation. Finally, the participants also developed a healthy and organized habit of self-reflection and even reflected on their holistic well-being and the meaning of having a ‘good day’. Behavior change is usually treated as an external and isolated process but our research shows that tracking a broad range of activities and feelings can inspire self-guided holistic behavior change.},

With the rapid development in AI technologies, there are many opportunities to develop tools that can assist students affected by these problems. Chatbots can serve as a platform for individuals to share their emotions, gain motivation to maintain a healthy lifestyle, and consider professional help. In this paper, we describe the design of our chatbot, named Abot, to encourage students to improve their lifestyle habits and well-being, which are important components to maintaining an optimal mental health. Validation with 25 senior high school students who used Abot for a one-week period showed a positive improvement in their physical well-being, positive change in their social well-being, and positive change in their academic well-being. Students’ evaluation of Abot on a 4-point Likert scale showed an average score of 3.35 on performance, 3.36 on humanity, and 3.68 on affect, which points to perceived user acceptability of the chatbot as a potential tool to help them manage their health and well-being.},

abstract = {MOOC participants often feel isolated and disconnected from their peers. Navigating meaningful peer interactions, generating a sense of belonging, and achieving social presence are all major challenges for MOOC platforms. MOOC users often rely on external social platforms for such connection and peer interaction, however, off-platform networking often distracts participants from their learning. With the intention of resolving this issue, we introduce PeerCollab, a web-based platform that provides affordances to create communities and support meaningful peer interactions, building close-knit groups of learners. We present an initial evaluation through a field study (n=56) over 6 weeks and a controlled experiment (n=22). The result indicates insights on how learners build a sense of belonging and develop peer interactions leading to close-knit learning circles. We find that PeerCollab can provide more meaningful interactions and create a community to bring a culture of social learning to decentralized, and isolated MOOC learners.},

In this work, we propose FacialPen, a prototype that uses facial gestures to trigger commands for pen-based manipulation. In our prototype, a fisheye camera is mounted to the end of a stylus that provides a broad view from which to capture the human face. We facilitated an elicitation study to identify natural and user-defined gestures for interactions with facial expressions. Different gestures can be further discerned via face detection and a classification pipeline. We designed a sketching demonstration application to explore usage scenarios and evaluated the effectiveness of FacialPen through a qualitative study. The user study posits that FacialPen supports efficiency by reducing screen widgets, enabling the continuity of creation work and liberating the user’s stylus holding postures when switching sketch functions.},

abstract = {Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) often lack valuable social presences that provide learners opportunities to interact and to be feel as a real person. This subjective experience of being present with a “real” person and having access to their thoughts and emotions increase the learning experience. Although MOOCs provide forums for such interactions, they are often populated with cognitive types of presence limiting social presence. Meaningful social interactions are challenging in MOOCs due to scale and design limitations. This research presents a conceptual framework of 4 phases: Cluster, Orient, Focus and Network to scaffold better social interaction in MOOCs. The framework introduce a re-design of interactions in MOOC forums space — leverages clustered groups by creating many communities in forums spaces with a community leader facilitating the conversations leading social presence. It also provides a community structure with orientation, focus to work in the community and better networking opportunities. An initial integration of the framework to a real MOOC with 27,554 students provides preliminary results indicating effective scaffolding of social presence in MOOC communities, yet the framework poses challenges relying the social interactions centered upon community manger. However, the study opens new directions to leverage communities in MOOCs and potential to scale.},

abstract = {Nowadays, smartphones have become an inseparable part of students’ life. Many previous studies have explored smartphone usage behavior in different contexts. However, to our best knowledge, smartphone usage behavior of the high and low academic result holders is very less studied. Thus, in the context of Bangladesh, using 7 days’ actual smartphone usage data of high [N=32] and low [N=44] performers, we investigate the smartphone usage of these two groups. Our findings show that low performers are more focused on certain apps of the Launcher category whereas high performers are more focused on certain apps of the Video category. Moreover, we find that low performers’ micro usage and review session number is statistically significantly (p&lt;0.05) higher. Based on different smartphone usage data, our presented machine learning model classifies these two groups of students with 73.33% accuracy. Thus, these findings suggest that high and low performers can be identified through smartphone usage data.},

People aged 50 or older have a death rate of 30 to 220 times that of the 18 to 29 age group.Each country strives to lower the infection rate by quickly providing the public infectious disease information through emergency alert messages. However, existing emergency alerts messaging systems provide redundant precautions. Also, the National Emergency Alert (NEA) messages are sent through the base transceiver station, the area where the actual COVID-19 confirmed case occurred and the area where the message was received do not match. In this paper, we present CO-ALERT, a tool that effectively provides older adults aged 50 or older with NEA messages. We developed CO-ALERT through a design thinking process to suggest solutions that effectively address the needs of potential target users. User-friendly interfaces of CO-ALERT enable older adults to view NEA messages based on their preferences. We hope the findings of this study contribute to a deeper understanding of the experiences of older adults during COVID-19 pandemic.},

ICDS field functionaries or Anganwadi Workers’ (AWWs) capacity deficit was identified as a significant factor affecting ICDS’s effectiveness. Considering rising numbers, over 1.4 million AWWs, and continuously advancing knowledge of community healthcare, conventional training pedagogy is ineffective in building and updating AWWs and their supervisors’ capacity, which calls for rethinking, using the ICT approach. Over 6 lakh AWWs in India were smartphone equipped by 2020. An android based quiz app was designed, following AWWs training modules’ content and need assessment results. The study investigates the quiz app’s effectiveness and compares it with conventional classroom instruction, with a group of AWWs, and discusses ways to make it an adequate substitute.},

A real object surface touched a hand is recognized using the position and posture of the hand acquired by a hand-tracking sensor on a head-mounted display; a virtual keyboard is placed on that surface to provide haptic feedback. We performed a pilot study to compare text entry performance when the virtual keyboard was placed in mid-air, on a wall, on a desk, and on the user’s thighs.

Although there is little problem to conduct one-on-one remote conferences, remote group discussion still contains many challenges. One of the main issue is that the remote participants often unnotice the referential action performed by the local participants. To solve such problem, we proposed to develop a function that automatically detects the presence of referential action and displays to the remote participant. One of the issues for this function is about what kind of information of the referential action should be provided and how the information should be displayed. In this research, we conducted a lab study to compare two displaying methods: Picture-in-Picture (PiP) and auto-pilot and compare two displaying contents: object being referred and person performing the referential action. The result shows that the PiP method had higher usability and remote participant had higher opportunity to join the conversation with the PiP method. On the other hand, displaying object being referred had higher usability than displaying the person performing the referential action.},

While prior work has assessed these tools qualitatively, it is still unclear how to quantitatively evaluate reference managers. This paper starts to quantify the user effort required to use reference managers. We first collected surveys from 69 graduate students to understand their experience with reference managers, and then conducted user studies with 12 participants. In our study, each participant was asked to perform a standardized task using four popular reference managers: Mendeley, Zotero, EndNote, and RefWorks. We used RUI, a keystroke and mouse-move logger, to record the participants’ activities and approximate their physical and mental effort. We also used pre- and post-study surveys to collect users’ feedback and self-reported task load (as expressed by the NASA TLX Index.) The results showed that different reference managers require different levels of effort, and users generally prefer the tools that involve less effort. We also found that although reference managers share similar features, differences in presentation and organization matter. We conclude this work by providing a set of guidelines for both users and developers of reference managers.},

In particular, the virtual keyboards are frequently used and they are time–consuming interfaces in VR. These virtual keyboards are related to both arm and neck fatigue. We considered that the text entry performance of the virtual keyboard and the workload of the users are affected by the position and angle of the virtual keyboard. To investigate these effects, we conducted experiments to compare the performance and workload by changing the position and the angle of the virtual keyboard, which is operated by mid-air tapping. A result of the user study showed that the higher the display position is, the greater the fatigue will occur in the upper arm, and the lower the display position is, the greater the fatigue will be in the neck.},

abstract = {This work explores shape-changing and weight-shifting mechanisms for haptic interfaces to simulate various shapes and sizes in Virtual Reality (VR) for the industrial product design process. The COMFlex system offers haptic feedback in the form of a weight distribution changing (COM) and shape-changing (Flex) device while perceiving a visual representation in VR. Any state changes to the virtual representation are reflected by the COMFlex system, allowing live dynamic feedback to the user. We share initial findings from experimenting with COMFlex in several use cases for our follow up design improvements. Finally, future work is discussed, including physical changes to the device and potential applications.},

abstract = {Women in developing nations lag behind from self-empowerment because of some cultural barriers where the integration of technology and digital financial services helps them to be empowered. On the other hand, to avail such technology-based services as Digital Financial Services (DFS), there are also additional challenges for women in developing countries. During the COVID pandemic, the situation has changed all over where both genders had to rely on and adopt technology for working and financial purposes. Our research is an ongoing research and currently we explored n=20 urban formally working women in Bangladesh to understand how COVID impacts them to adopt technology and technology-based services. These women had comparatively less exploration in digital services before the pandemic. COVID instantly increased their technology adoption significantly. However, COVID grows some negative concerns regarding excessive technology impact on their work-life, kids, and finance. Based on findings, we mention a few design recommendations regarding ways of technology usage that will help women to reduce their excessive technology-adoption concerns and help them to use the technology in better ways.},

abstract = {Advances in conversational interfaces have facilitated the widespread use of chatbots in assisting humans in their daily lives such as in retail services, healthcare, and education. With the use of Natural Language Processing techniques (NLP), chatbots can leverage on storytelling strategies to engage children in meaningful conversations to narrate and share their stories. In this paper, we compared two existing conversational storytelling agents, Orsen and EREN, by analyzing the dialog logs to examine children’s engagement when sharing their stories with these agents. Taking three dimensions - language production, flow maintenance, and affect; into consideration, results show that the ability of EREN to recognize emotions expressed in the child’s input text can encourage the children to be more open to sharing their stories. Even though the agent cannot generate affect-rich responses, its ability to recognize the emotions made children feel thankful and appreciative of the agent for listening.},

The development of various musical mobile applications comes down to the interactions between users and the applications. Common touchscreen interaction of these applications is unnatural as it loses certain physical aspects such as movement, size, and effort. A preliminary study was conducted to find out how users would interact with gamelan mobile applications, as playing on the real instrument and on the applications are different. Results showed that even with the touchscreen interaction, users played on the applications using different combinations of hands and fingers. Factors on users’ familiarity with the playing techniques of the real instrument and the physical aspects of how the instruments are played influenced their interactions on the applications. Findings from this study gave us more information on underlying criteria to design gamelan mobile applications with more natural and expressive features.},

Our survey had 68 participants and three key findings. First, time management is a primary concern, but emotional and physical side-effects are also important. Second, site blockers, self-trackers, and timers are commonly used, but they are ineffective as they are easy-to-ignore and not personalized. Third, away-from-computer breaks, especially involving physical activity, are helpful, whereas on-screen breaks are unhelpful, especially when they are long, because they are not refreshing. We recommend personalized and closed-loop computer-usage behavior change support and especially encouraging off-the-computer computer breaks.},

abstract = {The pandemic in 2020 and the resultant global lockdown led to new dynamics in the homestead. Families faced an accelerated process of digitization of conventional processes like education and white collar jobs. Working women with children of school or kindergarten age were forced to redraw the boundaries between the personal and the professional as the entire family essentially functioned from home, which increased prevalent gender inequalities. Tasks like 'planning', care-giving, emotional care etc. go unaccounted for and remain invisible to other members of the household. We present a feminist design research project that explores how design research can contribute to greater social justice and gender equality by a fairer distribution of domestic labour. We conducted semi-structured interviews in India during the pandemic lockdown, to elicit both explicit as well as tacit information on daily workloads of working women with families. We found disparity in domestic duties between genders, with specific regard to the circumstances created by the 2020 pandemic conditions. Based on our findings and analysis, we prototyped a visualization tool that makes invisible domestic work visible. Our research contribution is a design research methodology to generate insights to enable creation of design interventions for social justice. This was achieved through use of established design research methods, that are conventionally used in face-to-face settings, which were then adapted to exceptional pandemic conditions that required social distancing where communication was remote, and usually virtual.},

Moreover, since our method uses the built-in rear camera, it can be easily introduced to off-the-shelf smartphones without additional sensors. To demonstrate our method, we built a prototype system using an off-the-shelf smartphone.

However, current prototypical systems are mostly designed for needs on the surface and do not approach hidden needs. To develop an system that PwD wants to use on a daily basis, we conducted a co-production practice with PwD focussing on outing their home. We collaborate with a group of early-onset dementia who wanted their opinions to be reflected in ICT. A participatory design workshop was undertaken to discuss the development of outing assistants. As a result, it was found that they did not want the system to be responsible for intervening in their disabilities, but to positively encourage their activities. To conduct a case study for outing assists, we focused on a person with dementia’s activity to verify whether it contributes to her life. The system was implemented as a voice and visual interaction system, designed to encourage a positive relationship between the supporter and her. Our results indicate that the system design to support PwD should produce positive interaction and should be adapted to the individual context.},

MOOC platforms offer various advantages over traditional education. Still, it is inevitable that there still remain significant challenges that hamper the development and popularity of MOOCs. Interactions and collaborated learning remain as vital weaknesses. In this paper, we are interested in improving MOOC interactions by investigating learners’ experience with current popular MOOC platforms starting with a survey. We also conducted a task analysis on three popular MOOC platforms, Coursera, LinkedIn Learning, and Canvas, to analyze whether and how they include key interaction functions. We found that learner-instructor and teamwork interaction affect users’ experience most. Based on our findings, we propose a set of comprehensive guidelines, called IN-MOOC, to facilitate interpersonal interactions on MOOC platforms. In summary, IN-MOOC provides comprehensive and hierarchical guidelines to improve users’ experience via enhancing interpersonal interaction on MOOC platforms.},

The widespread adoption and use of PHRs will not occur unless it provides good usability for users. Autoimmune is a condition where an immune system response attacks its host. There are 80+ types of autoimmune diseases. Some autoimmune diseases are life-threatening, and most are debilitating and require a lifetime of treatment. The variability in the development of daily symptoms and the condition of the patients with autoimmune disease increases the need for PHR. Thymun is a mobile application made for people with autoimmune disease and contains PHR as its main feature. In this study, we do a usability evaluation in the previous iteration and also gather the needs and problems that patients have with their traditional way of monitoring their health. After the founded usability problems and new found needs we then redesign the product in the 2nd iteration and then conduct usability evaluation. It was found that the feature with the smallest usability score is symptoms recording. The results of the interview after the test obtained qualitative information about the problems experienced by participants when undergoing the test and the participants’ perceptions as users of the application design when using the prototype. Finally, a post-test survey was carried out using the SUS test instrument, which obtained a usability score of 74. The 2nd iteration has a better satisfaction rate,mission usability score and more positive remarks.},
