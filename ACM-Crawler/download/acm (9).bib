abstract = {The fields of programmable matter, actuated materials, and Soft Robotics are becoming increasingly more relevant for the design of novel applications, interfaces, and user experiences in the domain of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). These research fields often use soft, flexible materials with elastic actuation mechanisms to build systems that are more adaptable, compliant, and suitable for a very broad range of environments. However, at the intersection between HCI and the aforementioned domains, there are numerous challenges related to fabrication methods, development tools, resource availability,&nbsp;nomenclature, design for inclusion, etc. This workshop aims to explore how to make Soft Robotics more accessible to both researchers and nonresearchers alike. We will (1) investigate and identify the various difficulties people face when developing HCI applications that require the transfer of knowledge from those other domains, and (2) discuss possible solutions and visions on how to overcome those difficulties.},

abstract = {Virtual reality provides great opportunities to simulate various environments and situations as reproducible and controllable training environments. Training is an inherently collaborative effort, with trainees and trainers working together to achieve specific goals. Recently, we have seen considerable effort to use virtual training environments (VTEs) in many demanding training contexts, e.g. police training, medical first responder training, firefighter training etc. For such contexts, trainers and trainees must undertake various roles as supervisors, adaptors, role players, and observers in training, making collaboration complex, but essential for training success. These social and multi-user aspects for collaborative VTEs have received little investigation so far. Therefore, we propose this workshop to discuss the potential and perspectives of VTEs for challenging training settings. In a one-day online workshop, researchers and practitioners will jointly develop a research agenda on how currently underrepresented aspects of social and collaborative work can be integrated into VR-supported training. This workshop will focus on two themes: (1) Multi-sensory experience: novel collaborative interfaces for VTEs (e.g. joint use of tangible devices, strategies for preventing simulator-induced negative effects); (2) Multi-user interaction: collaboration in VTEs between trainers (two trainers run a scenarios jointly), trainers and trainees /the trainer controls the scenario for a trainee), and trainees with each other (e.g. two trainees solve an exercise together)},

abstract = {The Asian CHI symposium is an annual event organized by researchers and practitioners in the Asia Pacific since the authors first co-initiated South East Asia Computer-Human Interaction (SEACHI) during CHI 2015 [1]. The symposium aims to bring together both early-career and senior HCI academia and UX practitioners from industries in the Asia Pacific and bring about cross-exchange of information and transfer of knowledge in a multidisciplinary environment and multi-socio-economic aspects of HCI research, foster social ties and collaboration in the field of HCI [2]. As the Asian CHI community grows to be more diverse than when we started in 2015, there is a need to address the issues of equity, justice, access, and transparency more strategically, especially with a historical link to colonialism in Asia. Beyond showcasing the latest Asian-inspired HCI work and those focusing on incorporating Asian sociocultural factors in their design, implementation, evaluation, and improvement, the Asian CHI Symposium 2022 is a sandbox for decolonizing yet academically rigorous discourse platform for both HCI academic and UX practitioners to present their latest research findings and solutions that reflect the expansion of HCI theory and applications towards culturally inclusive design for diverse audiences in Asia.},

abstract = {Building on the prior workshops on conversational user interfaces (CUIs) [2, 40], we tackle the topic of ethics of CUIs at CHI 2022. Though commercial CUI developments continue to rapidly advance, our scholarly dialogue on ethics of CUIs is underwhelming. The CUI community has implicitly been concerned with ethics, yet making it central to the growing body of work thus far has not been adequately done. Since ethics is a far-reaching topic, perspectives from philosophy, design, and engineering domains are integral to our CUI research community. For instance, philosophical traditions, e.g., deontology or virtue ethics, can guide ethical concepts that are relevant for CUIs, e.g., autonomy or trust. The practice of design through approaches like value sensitive design can inform how CUIs should be developed. Ethics comes into play with technical contributions, e.g., privacy-preserving data sharing between conversational systems. By considering such multidisciplinary angles, we come to a special topic of interest that ties together philosophy, design, and engineering: conversational disclosure, e.g., sharing personal information, transparency, e.g., as how to transparently convey relevant information in a conversational manner, and vulnerability of diverse user groups that should be taken into consideration.},

abstract = {The LilyTiny sewable microcontroller was created ten years ago, in an effort to make electronic textiles more accessible. At the time, e-textiles was gaining traction as a means to invite more diverse participation in computing, but financial and instructional barriers stood in the way of broader adoption. In addition, there existed a scaffolding gap between projects involving lights, batteries, and thread – and those requiring programming (i.e. leveraging the LilyPad Arduino and/or additional sensors or outputs). In an effort to expand access to electronic textiles, we designed the LilyTiny, an inexpensive, pre-programmed sewable microcontroller which controls assorted LED patterns, and which later became available for purchase through SparkFun. Alongside the LilyTiny, we released a free workshop guide for educators which details five low-cost activities that can be taught without any prior electronics experience. This paper summarizes our development of the LilyTiny and companion curriculum – and reflects on whether we met our stated goal of expanding access to electronic textiles in the decade since. We share and discuss some measures of impact, including a survey of derivative products and a multi-year analysis of sales data from the LilyTiny’s sole distributor SparkFun Electronics.},

People's beliefs in their capabilities are a relevant component in human action, also affecting the motivation to participate. In this paper, we report the results of a study on the possibilities of an eParticipation platform to a) enhance the users’ self-efficacy in the context of societal participation, and b) lower the threshold of societal participation. Altogether, 34 young people from various backgrounds participated in Virtual Council field tests to collaborate on the Climate Change Act in Finland. The results suggest that eParticipation platforms can enhance the societal participation self-efficacy of youths that initially have less experience participating in societal issues. Furthermore, the threshold of participation can be lowered after using the eParticipation platform. The paper adds to the growing discussion on connections between youths use of digital services and societal participation.},

We postulate and present some evidence that this difference is due to employees implicitly comparing B2B with B2C e-commerce sites and therefore expecting the experience of a B2C site for a B2B site. Such a comparison, fosters a bias, which has implications for businesses that host B2B e-commerce sites. We conclude by sketching recommendations for practitioners on how to go about such a bias.},

We acknowledge an amplification of this trend through recent technological developments that aim toward human-computer integration, and explore the dark patterns that may arise for integrating emotions with machinic processes through “machine_in_the_middle”. Machine_in_the_middle is an interactive system in which a participant wears an electroencephalographic headset, and their neural activity is analysed to ascertain an approximation of their emotional state. Using electrical muscle stimulation their face is animated into an expression that corresponds with the output of the emotional recognition system. Through our work, we contribute the insight of three possible dark patterns that might emerge from emotional integration, including: reductionism of human emotion, disruptions of agency, and parasitic symbiosis. We hope that these insights inspire researchers and practitioners to approach human-computer integration more cautiously.},

abstract = {Collecting accurate and fine-grain information about the music people like, dislike and actually listen to has long been a challenge for sociologists. As millions of people now use online music streaming services, research can build upon the individual listening history data that are collected by these platforms. Individual interviews, in particular, can benefit from such data, by allowing the interviewers to immerse themselves in the musical universe of consenting respondents, and thus ask them contextualized questions and get more precise answers. Designing a visual exploration tool allowing such an immersion is however difficult, because of the volume and heterogeneity of the listening data, the unequal “visual literacy” of the prospective users, or the interviewers’ potential lack of knowledge of the music listened to by the respondents. In this case study we discuss the design and evaluation of such a tool. Designed with social scientists, its purpose is to help them in preparing and conducting semi-structured interviews that address various aspects of the listening experience. It was evaluated during thirty interviews with consenting users of a streaming platform in France.},

The approach is optimal for UX and market research, but is also easily employed as a structured decision-making exercise outside of consumer research.

In this paper, we introduce opportunistic interfaces to grant users complete freedom to summon virtual interfaces on everyday objects via voice commands or tapping gestures. We present the workflow and technical details of Ad hoc UI (AhUI), a prototyping toolkit to empower users to turn everyday objects into opportunistic interfaces on the fly.

We also call attention to the importance of care, patience, and understanding during the design processes to facilitate the creation of playful designs that respect the agency of each biomaterial.

abstract = {There has been a growing interest in HCI to understand the specific technological needs of people with dementia and supporting them in self-managing daily activities. One of the most difficult challenges to address is supporting the fluctuating accessibility needs of people with dementia, which vary with the specific type of dementia and the progression of the condition. Researchers have identified auto-personalized interfaces, and more recently, Artificial Intelligence or AI-driven personalization as a potential solution to making commercial technology accessible in a scalable manner for users with fluctuating ability. However, there is a lack of understanding on the perceptions of people with dementia around AI as an aid to their everyday technology use and its role in their overall self-management systems, which include other non-AI technology, and human assistance. In this paper, we present future directions for the design of AI-based systems to personalize an interface for dementia-related changes in different types of memory, along with expectations for AI interactions with the user with dementia.},

abstract = {Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is an emerging form of aerial transport and is expected to pave the way for a new mobility experience. In order for UAM to be successfully integrated into the current urban transportation system, user experience (UX) considerations need to be explored. However, few studies have revealed the understanding of user needs and requirements from the perspective of transportation experience. In this regard, our research team conducted workshops with vehicle experts to explore important UX considerations for UAM usage according to the initial and mature phases of UAM operations. Also, we uncovered UAM usage motives, potential use cases, as well as three expected forms of UAM operations. The findings from this study contribute to providing insights and design guidelines for UAM UX developers in future urban contexts.},

While technologies for vitality in the office context gain popularity, they are often solution-focused and fall short in acknowledging personal needs. Building on approaches from personal informatics, we see value in opening up the design space of tracking and sensing technologies for office workers. We designed and deployed an open-ended sensor kit and conducted two complementary studies to investigate the value of empowering office workers to investigate their own working habits. Findings show that Habilyzer triggers curiosity about working habits, and wireless sensors contribute to inquire into those habits, possibly supported by additional tools. We contribute new insights into how an open-ended sensor kit can be designed to support self-tracking practices and underlying reflections in the underexplored context of office work. It is an alternative approach to workplace vitality, moving from solution-oriented technologies to inquiry-enabling tools.},

abstract = {Gaming is a more accessible, engaging and popular past-time than ever before. Recent research highlights games as strikingly effective means of capturing and holding our attention — so effective, some argue, to the point of deleterious effect. An impassioned CHI2021 panel discussion directed these efforts towards the ethics and adoption of dark patterns. And yet, we know little as to how dark patterns are perceived and arise in the design, development and use of games. This paper seeks to address this knowledge gap by recounting findings from a design-led inquiry comprising interviews and workshops conducted with mobile game players, designers, developers, and business developers. We contribute an understanding of how dark patterns arise in the development, use and commercialisation of mobile games, their effects on players and industry professionals, and means for the consideration, negotiation and navigation of these strategies for gamer-engagement by design — in support of healthier, highly-engaging game experiences.},

Using logistic regressions, we examine what psychosocial characteristics predict which users would report engaging in behaviors that are commonly labeled as “harassment.” We find that psychological factors such as impulsivity, reactive aggression, and premeditated aggression distinguish those who never thought of, those who only imagined, and those who carried out harassing behavior. Demographic factors other than age do not have significance, contrary to the results of prior studies. Design interventions that address propensities to perpetrate harassment might reduce harm but also raise ethical and moral concerns about the nature of harassment and the disposition toward it.},

To support increasingly situated and participatory practices in this space, we propose a turn towards co-designing from-the-wild, i.e. ideating during raw engagements that are radically situated in nature. Our approach extends existing in-the-wild practices by (1) enacting co-design in natural (rather than human-made) environments, and (2) avoiding techniques that privilege the designer's agenda over other stakeholders’ and compromise the situated nature of ideation. Our contribution includes: (1) the proposal of co-designing from-the-wild as a response to the limitations of existing in-the-wild methods when designing for and from nature; and (2) early reflections from our hands-on engagement with said approach, which begin to surface exciting opportunities and constraints emerging in this methodological space. By sharing our work-in-progress with the HCI community, we hope to spark a conversation stimulating future co-design methods research in increasingly wilder directions.},

abstract = {This paper presents Pneumatic Auxetics, an inverse optimization method for designing and fabricating morphing three-dimensional shapes out of patterns laid out flat. In origami/kirigami research, optimization of patterns that can be transformed into the target surface by inverse design has been attempted. On the other hand, in the research area of pneumatically actuated geometries, the control of the transformation using skeletons and membranes has been attempted. In the study of the inverse design of the auxetic pattern based on kirigami, it cannot actuate deformation by removing air because the design does not consider the thickness. Therefore, we simulate the pneumatic transition with the thick shell structure that is generated by offsetting the input surface (Figure 1). The designed skeleton is optimized for FGF (Fused Granular Fabrication) 3D printing, and it is 3D printed using soft elastomeric materials. These allow for both a deformable hinge and a rigid pattern. Thus, a skeleton made of a single material can be deformed to approximate the shape of the target-input surface by placing it in a membrane and removing the air. In this paper, we introduce related works and research contexts, challenges, inverse design simulator and its fabrication by 3D printing, and potential future applications.},

Our more open-ended approach to computer-augmented reflection explores new tangible mediums and methods to facilitate a sense of playful fluidity in machine interactions. A deep learning pipeline is developed that finds meaning within user journals by identifying similar poems/stories/texts in a pre-collected corpus. A dispenser outputs a drink mix with flavors based on these discovered meanings, and prints a receipt to help users make sense of their experience. To encourage disclosure and create a reflective mood, we model our experience based on journaling at an intimate cafe. Our preliminary evaluation demonstrates strong promise in this approach.},

Although some classrooms are equipped with sign language interpreters specifically for deaf students, DHH students have trouble switching their gaze and attention when they cannot see the interpreter and the visual information in the classroom simultaneously. To address this challenge, this paper develops Avatar Interpreter, a visual interface for synchronized sign language interpreters on an augmented reality head-mounted display. Avatar Interpreter can be displayed at different sizes and in different locations in space to fit different scenarios, helping deaf students to better receive sign language information and enhancing the classroom experience for deaf students. In the work presented in this paper, we discuss our prototype, make design recommendations, and discuss configuration and implementation. Finally, we propose questions and research methods for an upcoming user study.},

abstract = {A major challenge in remote meetings is that awareness cues, such as gaze, become degraded despite playing a crucial role in communication and establishing joint attention. Eye tracking allows overcoming these obstacles by enabling augmentation of remote meetings with gaze information. In this project, we followed a participatory approach by first distributing a scenario-based survey to students (n=79) to uncover their preference of eye-based joint attention support (real-time, retrospective, real-time &amp; retrospective, no) for remote university meetings. Building on these findings, we developed EyeMeet, an eye-based joint attention support system that combines state-of-the-art real-time joint attention support with a retrospective attention feedback for remote meetings. In a four-week study, two student groups worked remotely on course assignments using EyeMeet. Our findings of the study highlight that EyeMeets supports students in staying more focused on the meetings. Complementing real-time joint attention support, retrospective joint attention feedback is recognized to provide valuable support for reflecting and adapting behavior for upcoming meetings.},

abstract = {The widespread use of Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs) allows ordinary users to interact with their friends daily in social Virtual Environments (VEs) or metaverse. However, it is not easy to eat in a metaverse while wearing an HMD because the Real Environment (RE) is not visible. Currently, users watch the RE’s food through the gap between the user’s face and the HMD (None) or superimposing a video see-through (VST) image on the VE, but these methods reduce the sense of presence. To allow natural eating in a VE, we propose Ukemochi that improves the presence and ease of eating. Ukemochi seamlessly overlays a food segmentation image inferred by deep neural networks on a VE. Ukemochi can be used simultaneously as a VE created with the OpenVR API and can be easily deployed for the metaverse. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of Ukemochi by comparing three visual presentation methods (None, VST, and Ukemochi) and two meal conditions (Hand condition and Plate condition). The experimental results demonstrated that Ukemochi enables users to maintain a high presence in VE and improve the ease of eating. We believe that our study will provide users with the experience of eating in the metaverse and encourage further research on eating in the metaverse.},

However, it is unclear if and how smart home visitors should authenticate as they usually do not have access to respective interfaces. We explore considerations for the design of authentication for visitors evolving around, e.g., the visitors themselves as well as the environment and concrete mechanisms. Moreover, we suggest a concrete idea: security questions to authenticate visitors in smart homes. In an interview study (N = 24), we found that owners and visitors appreciated the low effort and would adapt our approach. We conclude with future research directions that we hope will spark further discussions around the design of authentication for smart homes, considering visitors and owners alike.},

These risk assessments act as data collection mechanisms and have been further developed into algorithmic systems in recent years. Moreover, several of these algorithms have reinforced biased theoretical constructs and predictors because of the easy availability of structured assessment data. In this study, we critically examine the Washington Assessment of Risk Model (WARM), a prominent risk assessment tool that has been adopted by over 30 states in the United States and has been repurposed into more complex algorithmic systems. We compared WARM against the narrative coding of casenotes written by caseworkers who used WARM. We found significant discrepancies between the casenotes and WARM data where WARM scores did not not mirror caseworkers’ notes about family risk. We provide the SIGCHI community with some initial findings from the quantitative de-construction of a child-welfare risk assessment algorithm.},

We address these issues with an open source design to facilitate the construction of VR-enabled wearables for conducting scientific experiments. Our work is motivated by research in mixed realities in pervasive computing environments. We introduce our system and present a proof-of-concept study with 17 participants.

abstract = {To learn how to self-direct research, students must learn to reflect and improve upon a diverse set of metacognitive skills. Models like Agile Research Studios (ARS) provide ecosystems of tools and processes designed to help students hone their reflection skills as they practice research. However, students still struggle to enact their reflection processes across the supports available to them, as mentors coach them to do. MindYoga integrates a process framework that helps students monitor and enact their metacognitive reflection process across an ARS ecosystem. Findings show students using MindYoga were (1) able to monitor which metacognitive risks may affect their upcoming project work, (2) able to develop action plans based on mentor feedback to address these risks, and (3) actively reminded of their action items during relevant practice sessions. Moving forward, process frameworks like MindYoga can help learners develop and improve their work processes as they practice within learning ecosystems.},

abstract = {Connecting digital information with the physical is one of the essential ideas of tangible user interfaces. The design of the physical representation is important especially for specialised domains like surgery planning, because surgeons rely heavily on their tactile senses. Therefore, this research work investigates the effect of a soft and a hard 3D model as an interaction device for virtual reality surgical planning. A user study with 13 surgeons reveals a clear preference for the softer, more realistic material and a significantly higher haptic user experience for the soft model compared to the hard one. These results advocate for stressing material aspects along with the interaction design in domains with an inherently high focus on tactile aspects.},

We introduce MisVis, a web-based interactive tool that helps users better assess misinformation websites and understand their connections with other misinformation sites through visual explanations. Different from the existing techniques that primarily only focus on alerting users of misinformation, MisVis provides new ways to visualize how the site is involved in spreading information on the web and social media. Through MisVis, we contribute novel interactive visual design: Summary View helps users understand a site’s overall reliability by showing the distributions of its linked websites; Graph View presents users with the connection details of how a site is linked to other misinformation websites. In collaboration with researchers at a large security company, we are working to deploy MisVis as a web browser extension for broader impact.},

abstract = {Applications based on speech recognition have become widely used, and speech input is increasingly being utilized to create documents. However, it is still difficult to correct misrecognition by speech, which makes it necessary to re-edit documents by other means such as manual input. It is also difficult to input symbols and commands because these may be misrecognized as text letters. To deal with these problems, we propose a speech interaction method called DualVoice in which commands are input in a whispered voice and letters in a normal voice. The proposed method does not require any special hardware other than a regular microphone, thus enabling a complete hands-free interaction, and it can be used in a wide range of situations where speech recognition is already available. We designed two neural networks, one for discriminating normal speech from whispered speech, and the second for recognizing whisper speech.},

We identify two possible risks associated with cookies—the functional risk that denying cookies will degrade user experience and the privacy risk that accepting cookies will allow a website to access and sell personal information—and explore how the slant of a cookie consent banner (which risk it emphasizes) and the framing of a banner (whether it emphasizes the potential for gain or the potential for loss) impact user decisions. We conduct an empirical users study (n = 1557) in which we observe how users interact with different cookie banner prompts. We find that for both possible slants, a negative framing is significantly more effective at nudging user decisions. We also find that the combination of slant and framing impact cookie opt-out rates by a factor of three. These results demonstrate the need for further consideration of the ethical implications of framing and nudging in the context of consent requests.},

abstract = {Technological objects present themselves as necessary, only to become obsolete faster than ever before. This phenomenon has led to a population that experiences a plethora of technological objects and interfaces as they age, which become associated with certain stages of life and disappear thereafter. Noting the expanding body of literature within HCI about appropriation, our work pinpoints an area that needs more attention, “outdated technologies.” In other words, we assert that design practices can profit as much from imaginaries of the future as they can from reassessing artefacts from the past in a critical way. In a two-week fieldwork with 37 HCI students, we gathered an international collection of nostalgic devices from 14 different countries to investigate what memories people still have of older technologies and the ways in which these memories reveal normative and accidental use of technological objects. We found that participants primarily remembered older technologies with positive connotations and shared memories of how they had adapted and appropriated these technologies, rather than normative uses. We refer to this phenomenon as nostalgic reminiscence. In the future, we would like to develop this concept further by discussing how nostalgic reminiscence can be operationalized to stimulate speculative design in the present.},

We aim to design VR technologies to enhance social VR accessibility for PVI. We focus on facilitating peripheral awareness, a vital ability in social activities. With an iterative design process involving five participants, we designed VRBubble, a VR technique to facilitate peripheral awareness for PVI via spatial audio. Based on Hall’s proxemic theory, VRBubble divides the social space with three Bubbles—Intimate, Personal, and Social Bubble—generating spatial audio feedback to distinguish avatars in different bubbles and provide suitable avatar information. We provide three audio alternatives: earcons, verbal notifications, and sound effects. PVI can select and combine their preferred feedback alternatives for different social context to maintain avatar awareness in a dynamic social VR environment.},

Moreover, research that does address gender perceptions has been limited by a reliance on the human gender binary model of feminine and masculine, prescriptive response options, and/or researcher assumptions and/or ascriptions of participant gendering. In response, we conducted an online pilot categorization study (n=55) wherein we provided gender-expansive response options for rating four robots ranging across four levels of anthropomorphism. Findings indicate that people gender robots in diverse ways, and not necessarily in relation to the gender binary. Additionally, less anthropomorphic robots and the childlike humanoid robot were deemed masculine, while the iconic robot was deemed gender neutral, fluid, and/or ambiguous. We discuss implications for future work on all humanoid robots.},

VR class creates much better engagement and helps to stimulate interest and motivation in learning, making it an ideal solution to online teaching and learning activities, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Distraction is an unavoidable problem in immersive virtual classes, which has a great detrimental impact on learning. However, how to intervene in students’ distraction behaviors in immersive virtual environments has not been thoroughly investigated up to now. In this paper, inspired by teachers’ instructional techniques in real-life classes, we propose three intervention strategies, namely eye contact, verbal warning and text warning, and explore the intervening effects of these strategies on the inattention of students seated at the front or back of a virtual classroom via eye tracking. Our results show that all of the proposed intervention strategies have positive impacts on the attention of students. This research gives evidence that teachers’ instructional techniques in the real world can be transferred to the virtual class, which provides a new insight for the future design of educational VR.},

Then labels are often aggregated to create an annotated dataset suitable for supervised machine learning tasks. The most popular label aggregation method is majority voting, where each item in the dataset is assigned the most common label from the annotators. This approach is optimal when annotators are unbiased domain experts. In this paper, we propose Debiased Label Aggregation (DLA) an alternative method for label aggregation in subjective HITs, where cross-annotator agreement varies. DLA leverages user voting behavior patterns to weight labels. Our experiments show that DLA outperforms majority voting in several performance metrics; e.g. a percentage increase of 20 points in the F1 measure before data augmentation, and a percentage increase of 35 points in the same measure after data augmentation. Since DLA is deceptively simple, we hope it will help researchers to tackle subjective labeling tasks.},

abstract = {Designing aesthetically pleasing single-page graphic designs (”banners”) that appeal to the target recipients is non-trivial and requires considerable human effort. Designers often start by collecting assets like background images, inspirational banners, and relevant taglines/textual phrases, and iterate over variants of the designs by testing different combinations of these assets for their current task. To expand creative processes beyond professionals, it is crucial to accelerate this tedious process of creating design variants. To this end, we propose an algorithm that takes as input multiple image and text elements to generate several visually pleasing banner designs harmonized for text colors, font styles, and the placement of these multimodal assets. The generated layout accounts for background image saliency and uses this to select typographic and color variants yielding the harmonized outputs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in generating aesthetic banners with the help of a crowdsourced experiment.},
