abstract = {Nowadays, remote conferences are widely seen in many situations. Although there is little problem to conduct one-on-one remote conferences, remote group discussion still contains many challenges. One of the main issue is that the remote participants often unnotice the referential action performed by the local participants. To solve such problem, we proposed to develop a function that automatically detects the presence of referential action and displays to the remote participant. One of the issues for this function is about what kind of information of the referential action should be provided and how the information should be displayed. In this research, we conducted a lab study to compare two displaying methods: Picture-in-Picture (PiP) and auto-pilot and compare two displaying contents: object being referred and person performing the referential action. The result shows that the PiP method had higher usability and remote participant had higher opportunity to join the conversation with the PiP method. On the other hand, displaying object being referred had higher usability than displaying the person performing the referential action.},

abstract = {Many researchers and students use reference managers to collect, manage, and format references and citations. While prior work has assessed these tools qualitatively, it is still unclear how to quantitatively evaluate reference managers. This paper starts to quantify the user effort required to use reference managers. We first collected surveys from 69 graduate students to understand their experience with reference managers, and then conducted user studies with 12 participants. In our study, each participant was asked to perform a standardized task using four popular reference managers: Mendeley, Zotero, EndNote, and RefWorks. We used RUI, a keystroke and mouse-move logger, to record the participants’ activities and approximate their physical and mental effort. We also used pre- and post-study surveys to collect users’ feedback and self-reported task load (as expressed by the NASA TLX Index.) The results showed that different reference managers require different levels of effort, and users generally prefer the tools that involve less effort. We also found that although reference managers share similar features, differences in presentation and organization matter. We conclude this work by providing a set of guidelines for both users and developers of reference managers.},

abstract = {The Virtual Reality (VR) users suffer from neck and arm fatigue. This is because the VR users are required to wear the heavy head–mounted display (HMD) and keep raising the arms. In particular, the virtual keyboards are frequently used and they are time–consuming interfaces in VR. These virtual keyboards are related to both arm and neck fatigue. We considered that the text entry performance of the virtual keyboard and the workload of the users are affected by the position and angle of the virtual keyboard. To investigate these effects, we conducted experiments to compare the performance and workload by changing the position and the angle of the virtual keyboard, which is operated by mid-air tapping. A result of the user study showed that the higher the display position is, the greater the fatigue will occur in the upper arm, and the lower the display position is, the greater the fatigue will be in the neck.},

In this preliminary research, we involved three college students with a sleep deprivation problem through the design process: discover, define, develop, and deliver. From the design process, we create a smart pillow capable of creating an ambient experience to help sleep-deprived sufferers through four interactions: lullaby music player, alarm, temperature control, and sleep data recapitulation. We test the concept remotely using the Wizard of Oz method. Although the testing impaired by our limitation on simulating the interaction remotely, we have gathered valuable input to improve the concept in the next iteration.},

abstract = {There is limited research on design guidelines for multilingual older adults, especially those with dementia, and from Southeast Asian backgrounds. In this paper, we investigate usability issues and user experience of a touchscreen-based dual-language cognitive intervention tool with cognitively healthy older adults and older adults in early stages of dementia from multilingual backgrounds. We present the iterative design and development process of our dual-language intervention tool, including usability and user experience testing with multilingual older adults. Our observations of usability issues and user experience during testing of the intervention tool with older adults primarily pertain to (a) language, (b) motivation, and (c) user interaction. From the observed needs, we derived preliminary design guidelines for touchscreen-based user interfaces. Our observations and preliminary design guidelines for touchscreen-based user interfaces are significant due to their focus on the needs of multilingual users older adults from Southeast Asian backgrounds.},

abstract = {The spreadsheet is one of the most popular general user interfaces. Table manipulation, such as cell insertion and removal, is usually performed by selecting a menu command or using shortcut keys. However, the enormous number of shortcut keys makes them difficult to learn and remember. We sought to design a mid-air hand gesture-based interface for table manipulation in spreadsheet applications. As hand gestures and table manipulations are both spatial in nature, there should be a natural mapping between them. In this paper, we performed two user studies to derive a user-defined gesture set allowing 13 types of table manipulation. In the first study, we collected mid-air hand gestures devised by participants for manipulations implemented in existing spreadsheet software. In the second study, we asked other participants to vote for their most preferred gestures. We analyzed the characteristics of the collected gestures and votes, and created a final user-defined gesture set.},

abstract = {COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the way teaching and learning conducted in tertiary education institutions, including in Indonesia. The pandemic has not yet finished; thus, education institutions need to consider this disruption as a long-term situation and therefore need to make a significant adjustment. Design Thinking has been used for a long time to solve complex problems, but there has not been any comprehensive implementation of Design Thinking in tertiary education. In this study, we present some of the ongoing research we conducted since last year in Cohort 1 to critically evaluate and redefine the UX Design Research course delivered by the Industrial Design Department of a state university in Indonesia. The intervention of the Design Thinking framework, the so-called Design Thinking 2.0, has led to significant changes in the course and gradually improved the teaching and learning in Cohorts 2 and 3. Authentic learning goals and appropriate support mechanisms have provided sustainable improvement of the course.},

abstract = {The first step toward accessibility improvement in the context of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is the identification of potential barriers. A recent study shows that words that are frequently copied to the clipboard by web users are relatively complex. A plausible reason is that users copy challenging words to search for a translation or more information. Accordingly, tracking word-copying operations of web users may be useful in identifying complex words. This study focuses on the users that apply word-copying. It shows significant differences in the frequency of word-copying operations among different populations of users. On the examined website, whose content is in English, users whose preferred language is not English copied single words to the clipboard significantly more frequently than users whose preferred language is English. Further analysis of the data also shows that word-copying was more frequent among users whose preferred languages have low proximity to English, such as Asian languages, compared to Western European languages. These results support the observation that word-copying indicates complexity, as it is reasonable to expect that native speakers of foreign languages (and especially of languages that are considerably different from the website’s language) are more likely to need help with complex words. Word complexity is subjective and audience-dependent. This study contributes to the understanding of which users tend to use word-copying, and accordingly, in which context word-copying data can be used as a word complexity indicator. It also introduces a new practical approach for detecting language barriers in order to improve language accessibility on global websites.},

abstract = {When operating a smartphone with only one hand, users typically use their thumb; however, there may be areas on the screen that the thumb cannot reach. Several reachability techniques have been developed to enable users to access such areas, but many of these techniques are designed to enable users to perform only a tap gesture, so other single-touch gestures such as long-tap, double-tap, swipe, and drag cannot be performed. To enable all single-touch gestures for unreachable areas, we designed a hover-based reachability technique that uses a cursor. In addition, we conducted a pilot study to compare user performance with our technique and that of existing techniques, One-Handed Mode (OM) and Event Forward Cursor (EC). The results showed that our technique was faster than EC, which uses the same cursor technique as ours, except for the double-tap gesture when the target was small. However, our technique was slower than OM, which is the technique that shrinks the entire screen. Lastly, we discuss possible improvements of our technique on the basis of the results.},
