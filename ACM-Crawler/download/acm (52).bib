abstract = {This panel will provoke the audience into reflecting on the dark side of interaction design. It will ask what role the HCI community has played in the inception and rise of digital addiction, digital persuasion, data exploitation and dark patterns and what to do about this state of affairs. The panelists will present their views about what we have unleashed. They will examine how ‘stickiness’ came about and how we might give users control over their data that is sucked up in this process. Finally, they will be asked to consider the merits and prospects of an alternative agenda, that pushes for interaction design to be fairer, more ethically-grounded and more transparent, while at the same time addressing head-on the dark side of interaction design.},

abstract = {The HCI community has largely failed to serve the millions of people in rural communities in the developed world. In part, I believe this is because our plural values do not match the more traditional, conservative values often found in rural communities. However, these rural communities, and in particular the marginalized populations within them, could greatly benefit from our work. I believe that one way to set the stage for deeper engagement with rural communities is by creating cultural micro-exposures—small brushes with the everyday realities of a culture or lived experience that is different from one’s own—using technology.},

Researchers have created animal personas to represent nonhuman animals as stakeholders in design efforts. However neither human nor animal personas allow for the representation of broader-scale ecological impacts in design decisions. To address this gap, we present an additional conceptual tool for design: the ecosystema. This design construct is analogous to a persona, but at the level of an entire ecosystem rather than of a particular human population or animal species. These constructs could allow ecosystem-wide impacts to influence design processes more effectively, and may provide greater leverage on current environmental crises than existing human-centered techniques.},

Yet this model has limitations, such as representing diverse human experiences as a singular point of “the present” and implicitly embedding notions of linear progress. Responding to this, we argue that a plurality of perspectives is needed to engage imaginations that depict a diverse unfolding of potential futures. Through reflecting on our own cultural and professional backgrounds, we offer five perspectives for design futuring as a contribution to this plurality: Parallel Presents, “I Am Time”, Epithelial Metaphors, the Uncertainties Cone, and Meet (with) “Speculation”. These perspectives open alternative approaches to design futuring, move outside prevalent notions of technological progress, and foreground interdependent, relational agencies.},

abstract = {In the twenty-first century, people need to learn and apply high-level thinking skills, such as decision-making, problem-solving, and critical thinking, in their daily lives. Traditionally when in need, people can get help from human assistants to complete these thinking tasks, yet, such human experts are not always accessible. Intelligent agents, such as physical robots and virtual chatbots, are promising alternatives to the human assistants in these tasks. My doctoral research focuses on designing intelligent agents to assist human users and evaluating the impact of their interaction mechanisms (i.e., way of behaving) on user experience. Specifically, my works surround this theme by proposing: 1) an anticipation-autonomy framework that models the service robot’s proactivity in decision-making support contexts (decision-making); 2) a bot assistant that helps users to solve the problem of writing poor-quality comments in online mental health communities either by assessing the writing performance or recommending writing examples (problem-solving); and 3) a chatbot in comparison to a non-conversational tool for facilitating people to read academic papers critically (critical thinking). My dissertation contributes to the design of intelligent agents for helping people in high-level thinking tasks and insights for developing appropriate interaction mechanisms for these agents in the future.},

This workshop brings together designers, developers, and thinkers across disciplines to redefine computing systems by focusing on technologies and applications that instil and nurture critical thinking in their users. By focusing on the problem of misinformation and users’ cognitive security, this workshop will sketch out blueprints for systems and interfaces that contribute to advancing technology and media literacy, building critical thinking skills, and helping users telling fake from truth.},

In doing so we will create cross-research area dialogues and collaborations. These discussions build a basis to (1) explore potential tools to support designing AI/ML systems with marginalized people, and (2) develop a design agenda for future research and AI/ML technology for and with marginalized people.},

For comparison, Major League Baseball has 500 million views and $10 billion in revenue, FIFA Soccer 900 million and $1.6 billion. Despite this significant popularity, much of the world remains unaware of esports — and in particular, research on and for esports is still extremely scarce compared to esports’ impact and potential. The Esports and High Performance HCI (EHPHCI) workshop will begin addressing that research gap. In esports, athletes compete through the computer interface. Because this interface can make the difference between winning and losing, esports athletes are among the most expert computer interface users in the world, as other athletes are experts in using balls and shoes in traditional sports. The premise of this workshop is that people will apply esports technology broadly, improving performance in a wide range of human activity. The workshop will gather experts in engineering, human factors, psychology, design and the social and health sciences to discuss this deeply multidisciplinary enterprise.},

One of the most typical problems facing conversational user interfaces today is that they often disappoint people by giving the same answer (e.g., “I don't know”). In this work, we focused on situations in which CAs do not provide a proper answer because of a lack of information. Under these situations, we aimed to find more effective answer strategies for CAs to provide people better user experiences. We tested four different response strategies using different degrees of inferences and information as ground. We found differences in usability and user experience depending on how CAs respond. Our results will help designers understand how people feel about the way CAs respond and create better CA responses in situations where it is difficult to provide accurate answers.&nbsp;},

abstract = {Record linking is needed to analyze observations across multiple sessions. However, recent privacy legislature such as the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) restricts the storage of information that identify individuals. Obtaining permissions to store information about individuals can be bureaucratic and time-consuming. Anonymous schemes such as self-generated ids and machine generated ids have been proposed. However, self-generated linking ids demand effort from the participants, while machine assisted schemes typically generate long and incomprehensible ids. Consequently, there is a risk that students and researchers will limit their research to single-session experiments to avoid privacy issues. To simplify the administration of small multi-session experiments, the HIDE procedure is proposed for generating short human readable ids for linking participants across multiple sessions while maintaining anonymity and being robust to input errors. The approach is different from previous approaches in that the goal is to minimize the length of the linking ids. First, the procedure converts the participant's name into a phonetic representation. Next, this phonetic representation is hashed, and a truncated snippet of the hash is used as the linking id. HIDE is initialized by searching for a salt (a random data added to the hash input) that minimizes the id lengths. Experiments show that the procedure is capable of coding small experiments with 20 participants using two digits, and experiments of around 200 participants with four digits. An implementation of the procedure has been made available through a simple web interface. It is hoped that the procedure can help students and HCI researchers collect more comprehensive data by following participants over time, while protecting their privacy.},

We present Post-Post-it, a novel VR interaction system that overcomes these physical limitations. We derived design requirements from a formative study involving a problem-solving meeting using Post-it notes. Then, through physical prototyping, using physical materials such as Post-it notes, transparent acrylic panels, and masking tape, we designed a set of lifelike VR interactions based on hand gestures that the user can perform easily and intuitively. With our system, the user can create and place Post-it notes in an immersive space that is large enough to ideate freely, quickly move, copy, or delete many Post-it notes at once, and easily manage the results.},

abstract = {The advent of larger machine learning (ML) models have improved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in various modeling tasks, ranging from computer vision to natural language. As ML models continue increasing in size, so does their respective energy consumption and computational requirements. However, the methods for tracking, reporting, and comparing energy consumption remain limited. We present EnergyVis, an interactive energy consumption tracker for ML models. Consisting of multiple coordinated views, EnergyVis enables researchers to interactively track, visualize and compare model energy consumption across key energy consumption and carbon footprint metrics (kWh and CO2), helping users explore alternative deployment locations and hardware that may reduce carbon footprints. EnergyVis aims to raise awareness concerning computational sustainability by interactively highlighting excessive energy usage during model training; and by providing alternative training options to reduce energy usage.},

abstract = {With AR/VR devices becoming increasingly common around us, their user authentication has posed a critical challenge. While typing passwords is straightforward with a keyboard, it has been cumbersome with conventional AR/VR input techniques such as in-air gestures and hand-held controllers. In this work, we developed a fluent authentication technique that allows AR/VR users to unlock their profiles with simple head gestures (e.g., nodding). This resembles the powerful “Slide to Unlock” interaction on touch screen devices. Specifically, we extract bio-features such as neck length and head radius from IMU sensor readings of these head gestures for user identification with machine learning. Though our approach is less strict compared with conventional password-based methods, we believe its swiftness greatly facilitates scenarios with frequent user switching (e.g., device sharing across team and family members) which demand quick authentications. Through a 10-participant evaluation, we demonstrated that our system is robust and accurate with an average accuracy of 97.1% on groups of 5, simulating family and lab use.},

While this is not feasible for most language learners, language learning games may be able to replicate an immersive language learning experience. We developed Delivery Ghost, a web-based game to teach Mandarin Chinese to beginner-level learners, including complete beginners. In a 2x2 experiment (N=159), we tested how immersion and interactivity affect learning gains (pre-post test) and experiences (enjoyment, flow, perceived learning, cognitive load). Participants in all conditions showed significant learning gains even though no explicit, lecture-style teaching was provided. We also found evidence of substantial learning gains and positive learning experiences independent of the level of immersion (i.e., availability of hints in English) and interactivity (i.e., animation vs. gameplay). These results suggest that interactivity and immersion are less critical to learning at the beginner-level than a well-structured curriculum.},

Conductive thread, water-soluble stabilizer, and home embroidery machine can create SkinLace, which is aesthetic, light, skin-compatible, body-conforming, durable, and inexpensive. The freestanding lace approach enables aesthetic customizable lace and patches through a combination of non-conductive and colorful threads. We propose three different applications of SkinLace; on-skin displays, capacitive touch sensing, and RFID tag antenna.

Today, code puzzles are predominantly introduced through static puzzle sequences with increasing difficulty. However, adaptive systems in other domains have improved learning efficiency. This paper takes a step towards developing adaptive code puzzle systems based on controlling learners’ cognitive load. We conducted a study comparing static code puzzle pathways and adaptive pathways that predict cognitive load on future puzzles. While the trialled adaptive recommendation policy did not result in better learning, our findings point us towards a different policy which may have a greater effect on learner experience. In addition, we identify predictors of student dropout, and use our experimental data to quantify learners’ puzzle-solving experiences into 7 principal component properties and use these factors to suggest approaches for future adaptive systems.},

Prior work has analyzed online help-seeking and help-providing messages during crisis situations, however, it is not clear why and how people commented on help-seeking posts to provide support, especially in such a crisis support community. In this study, we interviewed 23 commenters in the COVID-19 super-topic to examine their motivations and strategies for commenting. Our findings showed that geographical proximity and expertise level affected users’ commenting behaviors. For example, non-locals or people lacking professional knowledge applied a “copy-and-paste” strategy and acted as a bridge between help-seekers and influencers on social media, while locals and experts focused on detailed information and provided targeted help. Some commenters also exhibited avoidance behaviors due to their sense of powerlessness and frustration in such a long-lasting pandemic. We discuss the implications of our findings for designing social media platforms to better support people in need during crisis situations.},

A prerequisite for integrating such adaptive user interfaces into public terminals is robust gaze estimation. Commercial eye trackers are highly accurate, but require prior person-specific calibration and a relatively stable head position. In this paper, we collect data from 26 authentic customers of a fast food restaurant while interacting with a total of 120 products on a self-order terminal. From our observations during the experiment and a qualitative analysis of the collected gaze data, we derive best practice approaches regarding the integration of eye tracking software into self-service systems. We evaluate several implicit calibration strategies that derive the user’s true focus of attention either from the context of the user interface, or from their interaction with the system. Our results show that the original gaze estimates can be visibly improved by taking into account both contextual and interaction-based information.},

A trained image classifier estimates semantic material information from textured meshes mapping predicted labels to a database of measured frequency-dependent absorption coefficients; trained on a material image patches generated from superpixels, it produces inference from meshes, decomposing their unwrapped textures. The most frequent label from predicted texture patches determines the acoustic material assigned to the input mesh. We test the pipeline on a real environment, capturing a conference room and reconstructing its geometry from point cloud data. We estimate a Room Impulse Response (RIR) of the virtual environment, which we compare against a measured counterpart.},

However, current approaches used in HCI to describe contextual influence do not capture it appropriately. On the one hand, the often used Technology Acceptance Model and related frameworks are too rigid to account for the nuanced variations of social situations. On the other hand, Goffman’s dramaturgical model of social interactions emphasizes interpersonal relations but mostly overlooks the material (e.g., technology) that is central to HCI. As an alternative, we suggest an approach based on Social Practice Theory. We conceptualize social context as interactions between co-located social practices and acceptability as a matter of their (in)compatibilities. Finally, we outline how this approach provides designers with a better understanding of different types of social acceptability problems and helps finding appropriate solutions.},

To further explore the promising avenue, we propose to design personalized security nudges targeted at different mindsets and make the Consideration for Future Consequences (CFC) the testbed. Namely, we designed two CFC-targeted security nudges, Promotion and Prevention, for the individuals who care about future and immediate consequences, respectively. An online survey (N = 145) was conducted to test their effectiveness. Results show that both the nudges can improve users’ security attitudes, while the moderation effects imply that the Promotion nudge is merely effective for the users having deep concerns about future consequences. The findings indicate the feasibility of designing security nudges targeted at future orientations and illustrate the importance of tailoring nudges according to individuals’ differences.},

We propose a novel gaze gesture sensor based on laser feedback interferometry (LFI), which is capable to measure the rotational velocity of the eye as well as the sensor’s distance towards the eye. This sensor delivers a unique and novel set of features with an outstanding sample rate allowing to not only predict a gaze gesture but also to anticipate it. To take full advantage of the unique sensor features and the high sampling rate, we propose a novel gaze symbol classification algorithm based on single sample. At a mean F1-score of 93.44 %, our algorithms shows exceptional classification performance.},

abstract = {Our research goal is to summarize the body of persona knowledge by identifying knowledge claims. This can aid HCI researchers to (a) navigate persona knowledge to form an understanding of what is known about personas quickly, (b) identify central research gaps of what is not known (or said) about personas, and (c) identify claims that are not substantiated with strong empirical evidence and warrant future work. To this end, we use computational and manual techniques to extract 130 knowledge claims based on 9139 sentences from 346 persona articles and analyze whether the existing literature supports these claims. The results, clustered into four groups (“Definition”, “Creation”, “Evaluation”, and “Use”), indicate that claims regarding persona definition are characterized by a higher degree of consensus. In contrast, persona creation and use contain a high proportion of unverified claims. There are few claims concerning evaluation. Empirical research should address unverified claims and develop the ontological understanding on persona evaluation.},

abstract = {As reading on mobile devices is becoming more ubiquitous, content is consumed in shorter intervals and is punctuated by frequent interruptions. In this work, we explore the best way to mitigate the effects of reading interruptions on longer text passages. Our hypothesis is that short summaries of either previously read content (reviews) or upcoming content (previews) will help the reader re-engage with the reading task. Our target use case is for students who study using electronic textbooks and who are frequently mobile. We present a series of pilot studies that examine the benefits of different types of summaries and their locations, with respect to variations in text content and participant cohorts. We find that users prefer reviews after an interruption, but that previews shown after interruptions have a larger positive influence on comprehension. Our work is a first step towards smart reading applications that proactively provide text summaries to mitigate interruptions on the go.},

abstract = {The configuration of office environments is related to worker satisfaction and can improve work efficiency. Although open offices promote communication among co-workers, privacy issues surface as well as increased risks from such health concerns as viral infections and pandemics. On the other hand, territorial offices protect worker privacy and reduce infection risks. Unfortunately, such arrangements often hinder communication among co-workers. Although a physical office must satisfy different needs under various scenarios with limited space, the lack of flexibility in furniture designs prevents dynamic space management. In this paper, we propose a self-actuated stretchable partition whose physical height, width, and position can dynamically change to create secure workplaces (e.g., against privacy and infectious risks) without inhibiting group collaboration. To support secure workplace layouts and space reconfigurations, the partitions’ height, length, and position are adapted automatically and dynamically. First, we consider the design space of a self-actuated stretchable partition and implement a proof-of concept prototype with a height-adjustable stand, a roll-up screen, and a mobile robot. We then show some example application scenarios to discuss potential future actuated-territorial offices.},

We find (1) User experience of automatic documentation tools is usually considered as the supplementary for document quality. (2) Automatic documentation tools are faced with three user experience challenges. Developers do not trust the generated documents. High expectations towards automatic documentation tools also hurt user experience. How developers work and acquire information presents another challenge to the design of automatic documentation tools. Apart from identifying three user experience related challenges, this paper also benefits none SE professionals who are interested in automatic documentation tools by selecting representative papers and summarizing how evaluations are conducted.},

abstract = {Modern cars create a high-tech interactive space by providing entertainment and information functionalities to the driver and partly to the passengers. By introducing rear-seat infotainment systems especially in luxury cars, manufacturers started to also focus on the passenger’s experience. However, such systems offer mainly standard entertainment and internet-based services. To enhance the user experience of rear seat passengers, we present the concept of an interactive car door that enables passengers to engage with and explore their surroundings. Our system consists of an interactive door panel that shows points of interest along the progressing route, more detailed information is shown on the AR-enabled side window in addition to the rear seat display. Results from a pilot study (n = 11) show that our concept leads towards a positive user experience. The qualitative feedback reveals that such an interactive car door helps to make riding as a passenger more attractive and pleasant.},

abstract = {When the COVID-19 pandemic struck in March 2020, universities worldwide were forced to suddenly move all in-person students online. In isolation and away from their regular structures and coping mechanisms, students were forced to rely on online learning technology (OLT) as a full replacement for in-person learning. We hypothesize that students in this circumstance will experience feelings of learned helplessness regarding OLT and suffer from overall poorer mental health. We present a mixed-methods study to investigate these phenomena during the Spring 2020 semester among a diverse group of students. We explore multiple factors that contributed to these phenomena, such as motivation, growing exhaustion with online learning, and feelings of connectedness that were lost and cannot be recreated via online meeting software.},

abstract = {Deaf children born to hearing parents lack continuous access to language, leading to weaker working memory compared to hearing children and deaf children born to Deaf parents. CopyCat is a game where children communicate with the computer via American Sign Language (ASL), and it has been shown to improve language skills and working memory. Previously, CopyCat depended on unscalable hardware such as custom gloves for sign verification, but modern 4K cameras and pose estimators present new opportunities. Before re-creating the CopyCat game for deaf children using off-the-shelf hardware, we evaluate whether current ASL recognition is sufficient. Using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), user independent word accuracies were 90.6%, 90.5%, and 90.4% for AlphaPose, Kinect, and MediaPipe, respectively. Transformers, a state-of-the-art model in natural language processing, performed 17.0% worse on average. Given these results, we believe our current HMM-based recognizer can be successfully adapted to verify children’s signing while playing CopyCat.},

abstract = {To show off their playing, musicians publish musical performance videos on streaming services. In order to find out typical characteristics of guitar performance videos, we carried out a quantitative survey of guitar performance videos. Then, we discuss key problems of creating effects informed by the survey. According to the discussion, authoring videos with typical effects takes a long time even for experienced users because they typically need to combine multiple video tracks (e.g., lyrics and videos shot from multiple angles) into a single track. They need to synchronize all tracks with the musical piece and set transitions between them at the right timing, aware of the musical structure. This paper presents Instrumeteor, an authoring tool for musical performance videos. First, it automatically analyzes the musical structure in the tracks to align them on a single timeline. Second, it implements typical video effects informed by the survey. In this way, our tool reduces manual work and unleashes the musicians’ creativity.},

Furthermore, it is broadly taken to mean beauty, which, while a significant aspect of aesthetics, is not its only concern. Unfortunately, HCI tends to hold a narrow-sighted view of the topic that often ignores a rich history of discourse. Aesthetics is a key concern of philosophy, considering our perception of the natural and artefactual world. In more recent times, it has grown to consider all of our sensory perceptions of the world around us, where our encounters with everyday objects and environments are two areas of interest. Here, I explain how HCI describes aesthetics and give an overview of philosophical approaches to aesthetics, show where some common ground lies between the two, and suggest how aesthetic categorisations could work for artefacts in HCI.},

Embracing “weird” forms of sociality and embodiment, we incorporate inspiration from a range of sources including: (1) emerging rituals in commercial social VR, (2) existing research on social augmentation systems for meetings, (3) novel examples of embodied VR communication, and (4) a fictionalized vignette envisioning a future with aspects of “Weird Social XR” folded into everyday life. We call upon the research community to approach these speculative forms of alien sociality as opportunities to explore new kinds of social superpowers.},
