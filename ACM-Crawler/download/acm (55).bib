abstract = {We present SpectroPhone, a surface material sensing approach based on the rear camera of a smartphone and external white LED light sources. Warm and cool white LEDs, as used for dual or quad flashlights in smartphones, differ in their spectral distribution in the red and blue range. Warm and cool white LEDs in combination can produce a characteristic spectral response curve, when their light is reflected from a surface. We show that with warm and cool white LEDs and the rear-camera of a smartphone 30 different materials can be distinguished with an accuracy of 99&nbsp;%. Based on a dataset consisting of 13500 images of material surfaces taken at different LED light intensities, we report recognition rates of support vector machines with different parameters.},

abstract = {Responsible conduct of research (RCR) is an essential skill for all researchers to develop, but training scientists to behave ethically is complex because it requires addressing both cognitive (i.e., conceptual knowledge and moral reasoning skills) and socio-affective (i.e., attitudes) learning outcomes. Currently, both classroom- and web-based forms of RCR training struggle to address these distinct types of learning outcomes simultaneously. In this paper, we present a study providing initial evidence that playing a single brief session of &nbsp;Academical, a choice-based interactive narrative game, can significantly improve players’ attitudes about RCR. We further demonstrate the relationship between engagement with the game and resulting attitudes. Combined with our previous work showing &nbsp;Academical’s advantages over traditional RCR training for teaching cognitive learning outcomes, this study’s results highlight that utilizing a choice-based interactive story game is a uniquely effective way to holistically address RCR learning outcomes that drive ethical research behavior.},

abstract = {The effect of removing gamification elements from interactive systems has been a long-standing question in gamification research. Early work and foundational theories raised concerns about the endurance of positive effects and the emergence of negative ones. Yet, nearly a decade later, no work to date has sought consensus on these matters. Here, I offer a rapid review on the state of the art and what is known about the impact of removing gamification. A small corpus of 8 papers published between 2012 and 2020 were found. Findings suggest a mix of positive and negative effects related to removing gamification. Significantly, insufficient reporting, methodological weaknesses, limited measures, and superficial interpretations of “negative” results prevent firm conclusions. I offer a research agenda towards better understanding the nature of gamification removal. I end with a call for empirical and theoretical work on illuminating the effects that may linger after systems are un-gamified.},

abstract = {Although we extensively use routing services in our daily commutes, such systems are yet to be personalized around the user. It often happens that different routes are close in their estimated time of arrival (ETA) while being very different in how they affect the driver’s states. Using traces of a user’s physiological measures, different candidate routes can be ranked based on how they affect users’ well-being. In this research, we introduce the “empathetic routing” framework for providing human-centered routing based on historical biomarkers of the drivers collected through naturalistic settings and by using smart wearable devices. Through this framework, we rank three specific routes between two points in the city of Charlottesville, based on historical driver heart rate data collected through a three-month naturalistic driving study. Additionally, we demonstrate that the proposed framework is capable of finding infrastructural elements in a route that can potentially affect a driver’s well-being.},

While visual or tactile representations can be used to experience music in a live event or from a recording, DRM anti-piracy encryption restricts access to audio data needed to create these multimodal experiences for music streaming. We introduce BufferBeats, a toolkit for building multimodal music streaming experiences. To explore the flexibility of the toolkit and to exhibit its potential use cases, we introduce and reflect upon building a collection of technical demonstrations that bring previous and new multimodal music experiences to streaming. Grounding our work in critical theories on design, making, and disability, as well as experiences from a small group of community partners, we argue that support for multimodal music streaming experiences will not only be more inclusive to the deaf and hard of hearing, but it will also empower researchers and hobbyist makers to use streaming as a platform to build creative new representations of music.},

With this work, we attempt to open a new pathway to enrich human-food interactions beyond the traditional boundaries between the physical (edible) and digital realms.},

In this work, we evaluate the use of a co-presenter agent in the delivery of virtual presentations given over a videoconferencing system, comparing them to presentations given without the agent. We found that participants were satisfied with the co-presenter agent, and those who liked the agent (scoring above the mean on a composite self-report measure of satisfaction) rated the presentations they gave with the agent as having significantly higher quality compared to those given without the agent. There was evidence the agent helped participants feel less nervous about their talks. Interviews confirmed these findings, and identified additional advantages and disadvantages of using co-presenter agents in virtual presentations.},

With the popularity of social networking sites (SNS) steadily increasing, psychological and social sciences have shown great interest in their effects and consequences on humans.

Using an empirical design analysis, we identify interface interferences impacting users’ online privacy. Through a subsequent survey (n = 116), we find usage behaviour changes due to increased privacy concerns and report individual cases of addiction and mental health issues. These observations are the results of a rapidly changing SNS creating a gap of understanding between users’ interactions with the platform and future consequences. We explore how HCI can help close this gap and work towards more ethical user interfaces in the future.},

To develop this skill, the use of agility ladders is a widespread and well-known training method. While drills vary, having a human expert explaining and monitoring the exercises is usually advantageous. So far, only a few approaches to interactive systems for agility ladder training have been presented. In this work, we propose an interactive projection system to support an athlete in performing those drills. To investigate the effects of the location of those projections, we conducted an initial study with twelve participants using qualitative and quantitative methods. We found that while projecting instructions and feedback on the floor was favored, participants who were presented the same information in front of them on a projected screen partially performed better in a subsequent agility assessment.},

We report a large-scale NLP-supported analysis of people’s comments about the German contact-tracing app on news websites, social media and app stores. We identified prevalent topics, stances, and how commenting developed over time. We found privacy to be among the most debated topics discussed from various perspectives. Commenting peaked at one point in time, when public discourse centered on the potential tracing protocols and their privacy protection. We encourage further research on the link between the public discussions and actual adoption rates of the app.},

Using these recordings, our model can predict the participants’ well-being scores with a mean absolute error of 14%, relative to the self-reported well-being (“ground truth”). Both audio and text features from the recordings, especially, MFCC and semantic features, are important for prediction accuracy.

abstract = {The use of multi-rotor drones has grown exponentially as a consumer product and in the commercial sector. The inescapable reality is that drones will become a ubiquitous part of society. One major obstacle to the mainstream acceptance of drones is the public perception of drones being dangerous or a safety hazard. This paper presents an investigation into the human factors toward potential drone collisions. The study included twenty participants who underwent a controlled drone collision exposure and a post-exposure interview. We propose a novel drone collision exposure involving a novel experimental setup simulating drone to human collisions safely. We found that all participants identified the drone’s propellers as their primary concern, with the propeller’s sound being the most threatening. Based on the participant feedback, we identified some concerns on a drone’s unregulated aspects and outline common participant recommendations on drone regulations.},

In this study, we aimed to investigate the player’s bereavement process while playing the commercial death-themed game Spiritfarer. Through a thematic analysis of qualitative in-depth interviews with 6 participants, we found that the player’s grieving experience closely resembled the Dual Process Model of Coping with Bereavement by Stroebe and Schut. In the game, players oscillated between facing loss-orientation stressors (‘Character resemblance to the deceased’, ‘Sending characters away’) and restoration-orientation stressors (‘Taking care of remaining spirits’). Through this process, the participants coped with and sometimes reappraised their loss. We further found that the players bereavement experience and level of engagement greatly varied depending on their ‘prior loss experience’, ‘gaming environment’ and ‘tendency to focus on self or game’. Those differences were partly accommodated by the game through its complex and diverse characters and engaging game elements. We conclude with insights for future works in game design for bereavement support.},

abstract = {Avatar appearance, especially gender, influences user behavior in virtual environments (VE). However the effect is often examined only as a co-variant. In this paper, we use technology to empower individuals beyond traditional societal gender roles to effectively collaborate in virtual environments. We specifically investigate the impact of the partner’s avatar gender on the quality of collaboration in the VE, while performing an inherently male-dominated task. We designed a virtual garage, where pairs of same (C1) and mixed (C2) gender repair cars collaboratively. We evaluated the interaction using a collaboration questionnaire adopted from Team Effective Questionnaire (TEQ). Our results show that same-gender pairs were perceived as more productive and supportive. We envision that our work aids developers and researchers in enhancing the collaboration quality by supporting group cohesion and positive interactions.},

abstract = {We have developed a conversational recommendation system designed to help users navigate through a set of limited options to find the best choice. Unlike many internet scale systems that use a singular set of search terms and return a ranked list of options from amongst thousands, our system uses multi-turn user dialog to deeply understand the user’s preferences. The system responds in context to the user’s specific and immediate feedback to make sequential recommendations. We envision our system would be highly useful in situations with intrinsic constraints, such as finding the right restaurant within walking distance or the right retail item within a limited inventory. Our research prototype instantiates the former use case, leveraging real data from Google Places, Yelp, and Zomato. We evaluated our system against a similar system that did not incorporate user feedback in a 16 person remote study, generating 64 scenario-based search journeys. When our recommendation system was successfully triggered, we saw both an increase in efficiency and a higher confidence rating with respect to final user choice. We also found that users preferred our system (75%) compared with the baseline.},

abstract = {Intersectional bias is a bias caused by an overlap of multiple social factors like gender, sexuality, race, disability, religion, etc. A recent study has shown that word embedding models can be laden with biases against intersectional groups like African American females, etc. The first step towards tackling intersectional biases is to identify them. However, discovering biases against different intersectional groups remains a challenging task. In this work, we present WordBias, an interactive visual tool designed to explore biases against intersectional groups encoded in static word embeddings. Given a pretrained static word embedding, WordBias computes the association of each word along different groups like race, age, etc. and then visualizes them using a novel interactive interface. Using a case study, we demonstrate how WordBias can help uncover biases against intersectional groups like Black Muslim Males, Poor Females, etc. encoded in word embedding. In addition, we also evaluate our tool using qualitative feedback from expert interviews. The source code for this tool can be publicly accessed for reproducibility at github.com/bhavyaghai/WordBias.},

abstract = {Companion robots have been suggested as a promising technology for older adults who experience loneliness. However, healthy older adults commonly reject robots designed to be an ”artificial friend”. We follow the approach of ”companionship as a secondary function”, in which a non-humanoid robot is designed with a primary function that older adults perceive as appropriate, and a secondary function of companionship. In a Zoom-based exploratory need-study we unfold how older adults perceive the various aspects of a robot’s ”companionship” as a secondary function. Our qualitative analysis reveals several use cases that older adults find to be appropriate for their daily routine, and classify them into three high-level categories: companionship as ”attentive to me”, companionship as ”looking after me”, and companionship as ”experiencing together with me”. Our findings indicate that robot companionship, when designed as a secondary function, is perceived by older adults as a multifaceted social experience.},

EMS is a promising technique for force feedback because of its small form factor when compared to mechanical actuators. However, the current EMS approach to flexing the user's fingers (i.e., attaching electrodes to the base of the forearm, where finger muscles anchor) cannot flex one finger alone at the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint, they always induce unwanted actuation to adjacent fingers. To tackle the lack of dexterity, we propose a new electrode layout that places the electrodes on the back of the hand, where they stimulate the interossei/lumbricals muscles in the palm, which have never received attention with regards to EMS. We demonstrate the improved dexterity with a series of EMS-assisted music applications for playing piano, drums, and guitar.},

It is also unclear what they would find meaningful to follow the recommendations on healthy work conditions and behavior, while productivity is the priority. The Office Agents are a set of artefacts placed on the employee's desk, which capture data about the office environment. Air quality, sound level, light exposure, productivity, and physical activity level are measured to provide office workers with feedback on the ‘best’ working conditions. Using speculative design and Objects with Intent, the employee engages in a negotiation with the Office Agents based on the office ecosystem. Through this project and interactivity session, we open a debate on the use of sensors in office environments and the stakes around office vitality from the viewpoint of the employees.},

When the user's finger wearing our voice-coil contacts any of the interactive patches it detects its magnetic signature via magnetometer and vibrates the patch, adding haptic feedback to otherwise input-only interactions. To allow these passive patches to vibrate, we make them from silicone with regions doped with polarized neodymium powder, resulting in soft and stretchable magnets. This stretchable form-factor allows them to be wrapped to the user's body or everyday objects of various shapes. We demonstrate how these add haptic output to many situations, such as adding haptic buttons to the walls of one's home.},

This paper explores different interfaces for the automated detection and management of email harassment using artificial intelligence in order to investigate what degree of platform intervention email users prefer when navigating their email platform. Through conducting a study involving three different email platform prototypes based on the Gmail platform, we evaluate how varying levels of platform intervention affect users’ perceived sense of safety, agency, and trust with their email platform. Our primary findings suggest that users generally benefited from each of the system intervention strategies and desired higher intervention features when combating email harassment, as well as ways of managing this intervention based on their unique preferences.},

And yet, a better understanding of developer practices could pave the way for the design of more useful and usable tooling, more ergonomic languages, and more effective on-ramps into programming communities. The goal of this work is to address this knowledge gap: to better understand the high-level authoring patterns that statically-typed functional programmers engage in. I did a grounded theory analysis of thirteen programming sessions of practicing functional programmers, eight of which also included a semi-structured interview. The theory I developed gives insight into how the specific affordances of statically-typed functional programming affect domain modeling, type construction, focusing techniques, exploratory strategies, mental models, and expressions of intent. The success of this approach in revealing program authorship patterns suggests that the same methodology could be used to study other understudied programmer audiences.},

According to summative studies of writers (N=16) and readers (N=32), 69% writers enjoyed writing synopses with BunCho more than by themselves, and at least one of five common metrics were improved at objective evaluation, including creativity. In addition, 63% writers indicated that BunCho broadened their stories. BunCho showed paths to assist Japanese novelists in creating high-level and creative writing.},

abstract = {Sketching is a universal activity but an often overlooked skill – yet it can benefit researchers and practitioners in HCI – sketching has proven to be a valuable addition to skill-sets in academic and industrial contexts. Many individuals lack the confidence to take up sketching after years of non-practice, but it is possible to re-learn, improve, and apply this skill in practical ways. This course is a sketching journey, from scribbles and playful interpretations, to helpful theory, storytelling and practical applications. Attending individuals will learn techniques and applied methods for utilizing sketching within the context of HCI, guided by experienced instructors.},

abstract = {We present a case study where we developed an interface for remote vital signs self-monitoring at a large-scale isolation facility for COVID-positive patients, under disrupted conditions. These conditions were: a lack of time, lack of access to end users, changing requirements, high risk of infection and supply chain limitations. We first describe the background of the development of the facility and the vital signs self-monitoring system. We use the 5 commonly prescribed activities of user experience design - Empathise, Define, Ideate, Prototype and Test- to describe how our work as user experience designers was affected by these disrupted conditions. Finally, we recommend a focus on Empathy, Prototyping and Communication for user experience practitioners and educators, whose training may be needed in similarly mission-critical, time-constrained circumstances.},

This transition required that we replicate the in-person interactions remotely while maintaining the critical social connection and the exchange of ideas with medical providers. In this paper, we describe how we designed and conducted four user-centered design activities from our homes: participatory design workshops, near-live simulation sessions, usability evaluation sessions, and interviews and design walkthroughs. We discuss the differences we observed in our interactions with participants in remote sessions, as well as the differences in the interactions among the research team members. From this experience, we draw several lessons and outline the best practices for remotely conducting user-centered design activities that have been traditionally held in person.},

abstract = {Argumentation skills are an omnipresent foundation of our daily communication and thinking. However, the learning of argumentation skills is limited due to the lack of individual learning conditions for students. Within this dissertation, I aim to explore the potential of adaptive argumentation skill learning based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) by designing, implementing, and evaluating new technology-enhanced pedagogical concepts to actively support students in developing the ability to argue in a structured, logical, and reflective way. I develop new student-centered pedagogical scenarios with empirically evaluated design principles, linguistic corpora, ML algorithms, and innovative learning tools based on an adaptive writing support system and a pedagogical conversational agent. My results indicate that adaptive learning tools based on ML algorithms and user-centered design patterns help students to develop better argumentation writing skills. Thereby, I contribute to research by bridging the boundaries of argumentation learning and argumentation mining and by examining pedagogical scenarios for adaptive argumentation learning from a user-centered perspective.},

abstract = {Eye movement recording has been extensively used in HCI and offers the possibility to understand how information is perceived and processed by users. Hardware developments provide the ubiquitous accessibility of eye recording, allowing eye movements to enter common usage as a control modality. Recent A.I. developments provide powerful computational means to make predictions about the user. However, the connection between eye movements and cognitive state has been largely under-exploited in HCI. Despite the rich literature in psychology, a deeper understanding of its usability in practice is still required. This virtual EMICS workshop will provide an opportunity to discuss possible application scenarios and HCI interfaces to infer users’ mental state from eye movements. It will bring together researchers across disciplines with the goal of expanding shared knowledge, discussing innovative research directions and methods, fostering future collaborations around the use of eye movements as an interface to cognitive state.},

abstract = {Immersive virtual experiences are becoming ubiquitous in our daily lives. Besides visual and auditory feedback, other senses like haptics, smell and taste can enhance immersion in virtual environments. Most solutions presented in the past require specialized hardware to provide appropriate feedback. To mitigate this need, researchers conceptualized approaches leveraging everyday physical objects as proxies instead. Transferring these approaches to varying physical environments and conditions, however, poses significant challenges to a variety of disciplines such as HCI, VR, haptics, tracking, perceptual science, design, etc. This workshop will explore the integration of everyday items for multi-sensory feedback in virtual experiences and sets course for respective future research endeavors. Since the community still seems to lack a cohesive agenda for advancing this domain, the goal of this workshop is to bring together individuals interested in everyday proxy objects to review past work, build a unifying research agenda, share ongoing work, and encourage collaboration.},

abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has led to the proliferation of non-face-to-face video-mediated communication such as through ZOOM or Google Meet. However, video-mediated communication has several limitations related to exchanging vocal reactions and non-verbal expressions. Consequently, although current video conferencing platforms provide visual support through icons, it remains challenging for users to express various intentions because of the limited number of icons, their uniform size, and their fixed location. In particular, these limitations challenge designers who require collaborative design processes such as brainstorming. To investigate user needs related to icons that better support video-mediated communication, we conducted a participatory design methodology. Based on the analyses of participants’ brainstorming experiences with various icons through participatory paper prototyping, we found that icons that accurately reflect diverse user needs facilitated turn-taking during the design process, and allowed participants to exchange more opinions and emotions. Thus, they created a positive atmosphere in the online meeting environment.},

We thus increasingly shift between the real and the digital world, ranging from losing awareness of real surroundings to cutting out the digital world to truly be in the real one. In this work, we aim to explore the middle ground in between. We move beyond classic VR research on presence and look at everyday ubiquitous technology and its influence on presence in the real and digital world. By means of a focus group (N=6) and a subsequent online survey (N=36), we gathered individual notions of presence as well as experiences and situations in which people move between the worlds. We discuss the need to further explore presence and its dynamics across the real and digital worlds in everyday life.},

We employ a hybrid region-based and line-based scheme, which allows placing a representative image of each set data item at its region position and helps reduce visual clutter by line connection design. Energy optimization is exploited to compute the layouts of region-based set data items (balloons) and connected lines. The case study and the user study suggest the BalloonVis can visualize set data with more information. Besides, the proposed hierarchical scheme is more scalable on set data item size.},

We thus apply the bibliometric analysis to gain insights from the published literature. Our work outlines the trend of how the number of studies about AI agent transparency increased over the years. We also identify the major application topics and issues in designing transparent AI agents. Furthermore, we categorize the identified applications according to the specific dimensions (risk and timeliness) and put forward potential strategies for designing different agents. Besides, we suggest the possible transparency degree corresponding to the automation level.},

abstract = {Enabling healthier online deliberation around issues of public concerns is an increasingly vital challenge in nowadays society. Two fundamental components of a healthier deliberation are: i. the capability of people to make sense of what they read, so that their contribution can be relevant; and ii. the improvement of the overall quality of the debate, so that noise can be reduced and useful signals can inform collective decision making. Platform designers often resort to computational aids to improve these two processes. In this paper, we examine automated reporting as promising mean of improving sensemaking in discussion platforms. We compared three approaches to automated reporting: an abstractive summariser, a template report and an argumentation highlighting system. We then evaluated improvements in sensemaking of participants and the perception on overall quality of the debate. The study suggests that argument mining technologies are particularly promising computational aids to improve sense making and perceived quality of online discussion, thanks to their capability to combine computational models for automated reasoning with users’ cognitive needs and expectation of automated reporting.},
