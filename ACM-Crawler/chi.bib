	abstract     = {HCI is increasingly concerned with health information quality and spread of misinformation on social media. Despite many major platforms having been adopted across the world, the situated evaluation and sharing of health information is underexplored across diverse health systems and cultural and political contexts. Drawing on semi-structured interviews, we study the navigation of health information on social media in urban and rural South India, backdropped by plural knowledges around health and the specific politics and sociality of health and social media in this setting. We use Ivan Illich’s concept of tools for conviviality [49] to distinguish between how people creatively use tools versus how tools manage and impose values on people—participants aimed to use health information towards care beyond institutionalized healthcare, but insidious misinformation and information-sharing practices served to commodify, spark uncertainty in, and discipline caring behavior. We use our findings to expand understandings of the use of health information on social media and how positionality shapes how people are affected by and respond to misinformation. We also draw attention to the structural aspects of health misinformation in the Indian context and how the design of social media platforms might play a role in addressing it.},

Restorative justice teaches us to focus on those who have been harmed, ask what their needs are, and engage in the offending party and community members to collectively address the harm. In this research, we conducted interviews and design activities with harmed adolescents to understand their needs to address online harm. They also identified the key stakeholders relevant to their needs, the desired outcomes, and the preferred timing to achieve them. We identified five central needs of harmed adolescents: sensemaking, emotional support and validation, safety, retribution, and transformation. We find that addressing the needs of those who are harmed online usually requires concerted efforts from multiple stakeholders online and offline. We conclude by discussing how platforms can implement design interventions to meet some of these needs.},

This article builds on the premise that these procedures may have failed because they involve compound probabilities and mixture distributions which are difficult to compute in one’s head. We hypothesize that predictive visualizations of such distributions would facilitate the estimation of task durations. We conducted a crowdsourced study in which 145 participants provided different estimates of overall and sub-task durations and we used these to generate predictive visualizations of the resulting mixture distributions. We compared participants’ initial estimates with their updated ones and found compelling evidence that predictive visualizations encourage less optimistic estimates.},

In this work, we introduce a new system called Crystalline that automatically collects and organizes information into tabular structures as the user searches and browses the web. It leverages natural language processing to automatically group similar criteria together to reduce clutter, and uses passive behavioral signals such as mouse movement and dwell time to infer what information to collect and how to visualize and prioritize it. Our user study suggests that developers are able to create comparison tables about 20% faster with a 60% reduction in operational cost without sacrificing the quality of the tables.},

To address these concerns, we present Shared Interest: metrics for comparing model reasoning (via saliency) to human reasoning (via ground truth annotations). By providing quantitative descriptors, Shared Interest enables ranking, sorting, and aggregating inputs, thereby facilitating large-scale systematic analysis of model behavior. We use Shared Interest to identify eight recurring patterns in model behavior, such as cases where contextual features or a subset of ground truth features are most important to the model. Working with representative real-world users, we show how Shared Interest can be used to decide if a model is trustworthy, uncover issues missed in manual analyses, and enable interactive probing.},

In this paper, we study labeling approaches as part of the overall construction process of bar chart physicalizations. We designed a toolkit of physical tokens and paper data labels and asked 16 participants to construct and contextualize their own data physicalizations. We found that (i) the construction and contextualization of physicalizations is a highly intertwined process, (ii) data labels are integrated with physical constructs in the final design, and (iii) these are both influenced by orientation changes. We contribute with an understanding of the role of data labeling in the creation and contextualization of physicalizations.},

	abstract     = {Context-aware applications have the potential to act opportunistically to facilitate human experiences and activities, from reminding us of places to perform personal activities, to identifying coincidental moments to engage in digitally-mediated shared experiences. However, despite the availability of context-detectors and programming frameworks for defining how such applications should trigger, designers lack support for expressing their human concepts of a situation and the experiences and activities they afford (e.g., situations to toss a frisbee) when context-features are made available at the level of locations (e.g., parks). This paper introduces Affinder, a block-based programming environment that supports constructing concept expressions that effectively translate their conceptions of a situation into a machine representation using available context features. During pilot testing, we discovered three bridging challenges that arise when expressing situations that cannot be encoded directly by a single context-feature. To overcome these bridging challenges, Affinder provides designers (1) an unlimited vocabulary search for discovering features they may have forgotten; (2) prompts for reflecting and expanding their concepts of a situation and ideas for foraging for context-features; and (3) simulation and repair tools for identifying and resolving issues with the precision of concept expressions on real use-cases. In a comparison study, we found that Affinder’s core functions helped designers stretch their concepts of how to express a situation, find relevant context-features matching their concepts, and recognize when the concept expression operated differently than intended on real-world cases. These results show that Affinder and tools that support bridging can improve a designer’s ability to express their concepts of a human situation into detectable machine representations—thus pushing the boundaries of how computing systems support our activities in the world.},

With a Research through Design approach, focused on strength training, we augmented an instructional video with different sets of visual cues: directional cues, body highlights, and metaphorical visualizations. We tested each set with ten practitioners over three recorded sessions, with follow-up interviews. Through thematic analysis, we derived insights on the effect of each set of cues for supporting movement learning. Finally, we generated design takeaways to inform future HCI work on visual cues for instructional training videos.},

Many contact tracers rely on community member’s recall for those identifications, and face limitations such as unreliable memory. To investigate how technology can alleviate this challenge, we developed a visualization tool using de-identified location data sensed from campus WiFi and provided it to contact tracers during mock contact tracing calls. While the visualization allowed contact tracers to find and address inconsistencies due to gaps in community member’s memory, it also introduced inconsistencies such as false-positive and false-negative reports due to imperfect data, and information sharing hesitancy. We suggest design implications for technologies that can better highlight and inform contact tracers of potential areas of inconsistencies, and further present discussion on using imperfect data in decision making.},

We propose ScalAR, an integrated workflow enabling designers to author semantically adaptive AR experiences in Virtual Reality (VR). First, potential AR consumers collect local scenes with a semantic understanding technique. ScalAR then synthesizes numerous similar scenes. In VR, a designer authors the AR contents’ semantic associations and validates the design while being immersed in the provided scenes. We adopt a decision-tree-based algorithm to fit the designer’s demonstrations as a semantic adaptation model to deploy the authored AR experience in a physical scene. We further showcase two application scenarios authored by ScalAR and conduct a two-session user study where the quantitative results prove the accuracy of the AR content rendering and the qualitative results show the usability of ScalAR.},

These principles were developed through a co-design process with teachers and evaluated with 46 primary school students. We found that the collaborative authoring process with ExposAR supported students in understanding AR concepts and challenged their perspectives on AR.

In this work we identify and address three key challenges: empirically determining which metrics from prior and existing community approaches most impact reader trust; 2) validating indicator placements and designs that are both compact yet noticed by readers; and 3) demonstrating that such indicators can not only lower trust but also increase perceived trust in the system when appropriate. By addressing these, we aim to provide a foundation for future tools that can practically increase trust in user generated content and the sociotechnical systems that generate and maintain them.},

We examined deepfake conversations on Reddit from 2018 to 2021—including major topics and their temporal changes as well as implications of these conversations. Using a mixed-method approach—topic modeling and qualitative coding, we found 6,638 posts and 86,425 comments discussing concerns of the believable nature of deepfakes and how platforms moderate them. We also found Reddit conversations to be pro-deepfake and building a community that supports creating and sharing deepfake artifacts and building a marketplace regardless of the consequences. Possible implications derived from qualitative codes indicate that deepfake conversations raise societal concerns.

	abstract     = {In recent years, political crowdfunding campaigns have emerged through which politicians raise money to fund their election campaigns. Divisive issues discussed in these campaigns may not only motivate donations but also could have a broader priming effect on people’s social opinions. In the U.S., more than one-third of the population with moderate opinions show a tendency to swing their opinion based on recent and more accessible events. In this paper, we ask: can such campaigns further prime people’s responses to partisan topics, even when we discuss those topics in a non-political context? To answer this question, we analyzed the influence of exposure to a political candidate’s crowdfunding campaign on responses to a subsequently seen, unrelated scientific topic that is not inherently political but is seen as partisan in the U.S. (climate change). We found that exposure to an attitude-inconsistent political candidate’s crowdfunding campaign (a campaign that is counter to someone’s existing political beliefs) can have a significant priming effect on subsequently seen politically charged topics. This effect may occur due to the activation of in-group identity by the candidate’s partisan campaign. Guided by these findings, we investigated elements that can mitigate this self-categorization effect. We found that carefully designed content following framing techniques such as schema framing and threat/safety framing can mitigate people’s sense of self-categorization toward non-political topics.},

We find that heightened COVID-19 concern is correlated with increased depression, anxiety and stress. We evaluate the performance of different deep learning models to classify student COVID-19 concerns with an AUROC and F1 score of 0.70 and 0.71, respectively. Our study spans a two-year period and provides a number of important insights into the life of college students during this period.},

Prior work has established protocols for directly helping them mitigate these harms; however, there remains a need for flexible and pluralistic systems that can support survivors’ long-term needs. This paper describes the design and development of sociotechnical infrastructure that incorporates feminist notions of care to connect IPV survivors experiencing technology abuse with volunteer computer security consultants. We present findings from a mixed methods study that draws on data from an 8-month, real-world deployment, as well as interviews with 7 volunteer technology consultants and 18 IPV professionals. Our findings illuminate emergent challenges in safely and adaptively providing computer security advice as care. We discuss implications of these findings for feminist approaches to computer security and privacy, and provide broader lessons for interventions that aim to directly assist at-risk and marginalized people experiencing digital insecurity.},

Despite people widely expressing interest in using contact tracing apps, actual installation rates have been low in many parts of the world. Prior studies suggest that decisions to use these apps are largely shaped by pandemic beliefs, social influences, perceived benefits and harms, and other factors. However, there is a gap in understanding what factors motivate intention, but not subsequent behavior of actual adoption. Reporting on a survey of 290 U.S. residents, we disentangle the intention-behavior gap by investigating factors associated with installing a contact tracing app from those associated with intending to install, but not actually installing. Our results suggest that social norms can be leveraged to span the intention-behavior gap, and that a privacy paradox may influence people’s adoption decisions.

However, the BIG framework is constrained to goal-oriented cases, which renders it difficult to support changing goal-oriented cases such as design exploration. During the design exploration process, the design direction is often undefined and may vary over time. The designer’s mental model specifying the design direction is sequentially updated through the information-retrieval process. Therefore, tracking the change point of a user’s goal is crucial for supporting an information exploration. We introduce the BIGexplore framework for changing goal-oriented cases. BIGexplore detects transitions in a user’s browsing behavior as well as the user’s next target. Furthermore, a user study on BIGexplore confirms that the computational cost is significantly reduced compared with the existing BIG framework, and it plausibly detects the point where the user changes goals.},

This observation motivated us to explore the reasons why people switch their privacy settings. We studied these switching phenomena quantitatively by comparing the tweeting behaviour of users when public vs protected, and qualitatively using two follow-up surveys (n=100, n=324) to understand potential reasoning behind the observed behaviours. Our quantitative analysis shows that users who switch privacy settings mention others and share hashtags more when their setting is public.

However, these benefits may not be generalizable to all users. Therefore, we conducted an ethnographic case study with eight Autistic young adults, ten staff members, and four parents to understand how Autistic users of social media engage with others, as well as any unintended consequences of use. We leveraged an affordances perspective to understand how Autistic young adults share and consume user-generated content, make connections, and engage in networked interactions with others via social media. We found that they often used a literal interpretation of digital affordances that sometimes led to negative consequences including physical harm, financial loss, social anxiety, feelings of exclusion, and inadvertently damaging their social relationships. We make recommendations for redesigning social media affordances to be more inclusive of neurodiverse users.},

We propose an algorithm that identifies existing anchored decisions, reduces sequential dependencies to previous decisions, and mitigates decision inaccuracies post-hoc with 2% increased agreement to ground-truth on a large-scale college admission decision data set. A crowd-sourced study validates this algorithm on product preferences (5% increased agreement). To avoid biased decisions ex-ante, we propose a procedure that presents instances in an order that reduces anchoring bias in real-time.

In order to support the documentation usage behaviors we found, we built the Adamite annotation tool, which provides features such as multiple anchors, annotation types, and pinning. In our user study, we found that developers are able to create annotations that are useful to themselves and are able to utilize annotations created by other developers when learning a new API, with readers of the annotations completing 67% more of the task, on average, than the baseline.},

The mapping enables us to visually construct and analyze a wide range of graphs on top of images, videos, and sketches.

We designed Q-Chef, which combines a recipe recommendation system with a personalised model of surprise, and conducted a study to identify if surprise-eliciting recipes affect food decisions. Our study utilises a rigorous thematic analysis with over 40 participants to explore how computational models of surprise influence recipe choice. We also explored how these factors differed when people were presented with “surprising-yet-tasty” recipes, as opposed to just “tasty” recipes, and identified that being presented with surprising choices is more likely to elicit situational interest and prompt reflection on choices.

We present Mood Worlds – a VR application allowing users to visualise their emotions by self-creating a VE. In an exploratory evaluation (N=16), we found that Mood Worlds is an effective tool supporting emotional engagement.

However, the design space for such transformations is large, and practically uncharted. To explore this, we first establish an overview of the different states that a data visualisation can take in MR, followed by how transformations between these states can facilitate common visualisation tasks. We then describe a design space of how these transformations function, in terms of the different stages throughout the transformation, and the user interactions and input parameters that affect it. This design space is then demonstrated with multiple exemplary techniques based in MR.},

In this study, we aim to improve the accuracy of unknown word estimation by using reading activity data obtained from smartphone sensors and taking into account the individual learner’s English reading behavior.

Today, Human-Computer integration developed into an emerging paradigm, rapidly gaining traction and developing a theoretical basis over a number of recent symposiums and publications. However, as more contributions are made to the establishment of Human-Computer Integration, the more its concepts and principles seem to diverge, such that we now find that each theorist talks about something different when they say “integration”. Building on the 2017 panel, in this panel, we ask “What is the essence of Human-Computer Integration? And what are its implications for the future of HCI?” This panel seeks to facilitate discourse between leading thinkers from diverse backgrounds with the audience to come to a shared vision and mutual understanding of human-computer integration.},

	abstract     = {Criminologists and sociologists have documented the ways that technologies for community safety can perpetuate structural racism. Among these include policing technologies that encode Black criminality [4] and surveillance technologies which extends the reach of the carceral state [17]. Fortunately prior work in HCI has also investigated how the design of technologies for community safety can resist structural racism by employing strategies that stand as alternatives to traditional policing activities, including story-telling, community-building, and care practices [10, 11, 25, 27]. This body of work amplifies the practices of community organizations and employs their expertise to build safer community. I contribute to this body of research and ask how technologies can empower a layperson in the goal of building safer communities. This is an area of great potential— just as community policing technologies extend the reach of traditional policing, new technologies can be designed to extend the reach of community organizations aiming to dismantle oppressive social structures. Towards this goal, I leverage Transformative Justice (TJ), a community-based approach to addressing violence which asks us to not only examine the ways in which our current systems, structures, and norms perpetuate harm, but to also dismantle and replace those systems so that the conditions that enabled the harm are transformed. In this paper, I describe the current state of research, the principles of TJ, my goals for the PhD, and where I would benefit from further support.},

These systems often rely on sophisticated yet opaque machine learning models, which do not allow for understanding how a given decision was arrived at. This is not only problematic from a legal perspective, but non-transparent systems are also prone to yield unfair outcomes because their sanity is challenging to assess and calibrate in the first place—which is particularly worrisome for human decision-subjects. Based on this observation and building upon existing work, I aim to make the following three main contributions through my doctoral thesis: (a) understand how (potential) decision-subjects perceive algorithmic decisions (with varying degrees of transparency of the underlying ADS), as compared to similar decisions made by humans; (b) evaluate different tools for transparent decision-making with respect to their effectiveness in enabling people to appropriately assess the quality and fairness of ADS; and (c) develop human-understandable technical artifacts for fair automated decision-making. Over the course of the first half of my PhD program, I have already addressed substantial pieces of (a) and (c), whereas (b) will be the major focus of the second half.},

This thesis aims to go one step further, real-time 360-degree video communications. Researchers commonly based their experiments on controlled environments and participants with specific characteristics which reduce the reproducibility and ecological validity of the methodologies. We propose to design a methodology based on questionnaires and the use of biosensors to jointly assess technical and socioemotional features in bidirectional immersive communications. For that, we first present some research questions and then choose the tools, stimuli, and use case to answer them. The use case selected as starting point to validate the methodology is tele-education. This thesis is an invitation to leave the comfort zone and question the usage of methodologies that have been highly proven with previous technologies, but which may as well be insufficient to address the challenges of new communications.},

In Drafty, unpaid contributors voluntarily update a tabular dataset of Computer Science professor profiles at a multi-year timescale. In Sketchy, university students simultaneously sketch and co-inspire each other during voluntary UI/UX sketching activities at a sub-hour timescale. I seek to integrate lessons from both systems to develop a theoretical framework that uses a feedback cycle to provide users with practical random examples from evolving information to motivate new contributions. I will further develop this theoretical framework by extending Drafty to generate insights to automatically attract visitors and create the Virtual Readability Lab (VRL) to help users improve their reading performance through personalized readability tests and deepen our understanding of information design human performance. Both systems will give users the agency to seek randomized insights within a naturalistic setting to motivate continuous contributions to each system’s evolving information.},

For example perceptual manipulations in VR, such as redirected walking or haptic retargeting, have been developed to enhance interaction, yet subversive use of such techniques has been demonstrated to unlock new harms, such as redirecting the VR user into a collision. This workshop will convene researchers focused on HCI, XR, Safety, Security, and Privacy, with the intention of exploring safety, privacy, and security challenges of XR technology.

As a result, HCI and assistive technology research may not always attend to the complex lived experiences of disabled people. In this one-day workshop, we position disability justice as a framework that centers the needs and expertise of disabled people towards more equitable HCI and assistive technology research.

However, keeping a human healthy, happy and productive in space is one of the most challenging aspects of current space programs [11]. Thus, there is an emerging opportunity for researchers in HCI to design and research new types of interactive systems and computer interfaces that can support humans living and working in space and elsewhere in the solar system. Last year, SpaceCHI workshop (https://spacechi.media.mit.edu/) at CHI 2021 welcomed over 130 participants from 20 countries around the world to present new ideas and discuss future possibilities for human-computer interaction for space exploration. The SpaceCHI 1.0, for the first time, brought together crossdisciplinary researchers from HCI, aerospace engineering, robotics, biological science, design, art, architecture to envision the future of human space exploration leading the workshop participants and organizers to form a new global community focused on HCI research for space applications. With success from the previous SpaceCHI, we are exploring the exciting opportunity for researchers in HCI to contribute to the great endeavor of space exploration by participating in our workshop.},

How to teach ML and other data-driven approaches in K–12 education has become a focus of intensive research efforts, with many recent advances in technology, pedagogy, and classroom integration. What to teach learners, at what age, and how, are some of the open questions being explored. This study explored children’s interactions with a simple image classification tool, which used only two features to classify images. The results offer a proof-of-concept of how to teach 1) the principles of the ML workflow, and 2) some central ML insights, including image recognition, supervised learning, training data, model, feature, classifying, and accuracy. The results recognize how learning the principles of technology facilitates a shift in the locus of explanation from what oneself does to what the computer does. The results provide examples of how to support children’s developing data agency.},

Based on long-standing pedagogical research demonstrating the importance of using tools and visualizations to reinforce student learning, this case study reports on the impacts of using publicly-available visualization tools used in HCI practice as a resource for students examining algorithmic fairness concepts. Through qualitative review and observations of four focus groups, we examined six open-source fairness tools that enable students to visualize, quantify and explore algorithmic biases.

Through interviews with eleven practitioners during a three-week sprint and a workshop, we find that prompt-based prototyping reduced barriers of access by substantially broadening who can prototype with ML, sped up the prototyping process, and grounded communication between collaborators. Yet, it also introduced new challenges, such as the need to reverse-engineer prompt designs, source example data, and debug and evaluate prompt effectiveness. Taken together, this case study provides important implications that lay the groundwork toward a new future of prototyping with ML.},

Typically, this technology uses fixed arrays of transducers (e.g., two boards vertically or horizontally aligned) to display interactive content. That is, a fixed system of reference (SoR), defined by the levitation device, and dynamic mid-air content. This demo proposes a novel setup, featuring a dynamic-SoR for the device with the dynamic mid-air content. We do this by combining a PAT-based levitation device mounted onto a two-gimbal mechanism, resulting into a device with a dynamic coordinate system for volumetric animations. We describe our setup and demonstration, which aims to create an intriguing experience, where both the content and the device itself can freely move in 3D space, with the aim of challenging the user's expectations about the content displayed or even the principles enabling it.},

Meanwhile, previous studies have shown that the manipulation of soft-bodied ‘fidget’ objects helps people manage emotions and improve focus. This project explores whether combining fidgeting behaviors such as swiping, tapping, and clicking with supportive visual/auditory feedback on AR glasses can support emotion regulation in the moment. We will demonstrate three visual/auditory metaphors in the form of AR lenses (Lotus, Bubble, Fire) combined with suggested target fidget actions based on prior research, toward helping people to regulate anxiety, boredom, and anger.},

However, the current curricula from top institutions focus primarily on technical considerations for building VR applications, missing out on concerns and usability problems specific to VR interaction design. To better understand current needs, we examined the status quo of existing university pedagogies by carrying out a content analysis of undergraduate and graduate courses about VR and related areas offered in the major citadels of learning and conducting interviews with 7 industry experts. Our analysis reveals that the current teaching practices underemphasize design thinking, prototyping, and evaluation skills, while focusing on technical implementation. We recommend VR curricula should emphasize design principles and guidelines, offer training in prototyping and ideation, prioritize practical design exercises while providing industry insights, and encourage students to solve VR design problems beyond the classroom.},

	abstract     = {Spatially sonified audio is frequently used in virtual environments to serve as an object localization cue. However, spatializers that are available to the general public typically have their limitations and lead to sound localization errors. By combining it with non-spatial sonification, the technique of encoding information with perceptual attributes of the sound, the localization errors of spatially sonified audio could be reduced. However, the encoded information would require higher mental effort to understand, which could be a concern under high task load. In this paper, we conducted a subjective study to compare spatial sonification against combined auditory cue using spatial and non-spatial sonification for target localization. We tested both methods under low and high task load. Our results show that combined sonification could significantly reduce the errors in localizaiton, but the advantage would be influenced by higher task load. Further, we compared several different non-spatial sonification methods for encoding depth information. Our experiment shows that both pitch and pulse frequency modulation are feasible for presenting depth of the target. Our results could contribute as a first step to a general guideline of designing sonification method as target localization cue.},

We use frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar sensors to classify different objects embedded with low-cost radar reflectors of varying sizes on a tabletop setup. We also introduce Stackable IDs, where different objects can be stacked and combined to produce unique IDs. The result allows RaITIn to accurately identify visually identical objects embedded with different low-cost reflector configurations.

The effectiveness of this technique is contingent on people with free time and high motivation to visit actual locations. In this paper, we introduce a crowdsourcing platform for constructing accessibility maps that support people with diverse free times and motivations. A combination of field auditing and field sensing, coupled with including and excluding gamification is explored. Game types are determined based on the characteristics of field auditing and field sensing. The experimental results confirm that gamification improves the motivation levels and performance of participants in certain aspects of crowdsourced field auditing and crowdsourced field sensing.

Accordingly, this study explores Clubhouse's opportunities and challenges as a voice-centered social media through its user experiences. We conducted interviews with regular Clubhouse users (N=26) to gain insight into their motivation, social networking, and conversations. Findings highlight that voice is effective for establishing social relationships via interactivity and intimacy, mutual respect, and convenience from ephemerality. Conversely, users reported patterns of the privacy paradox and the oligopoly of communication. Design guidelines for future voice-centric social media are proposed.

In this paper we report on an experiment exploring the relationship between eye gaze and inter-brain synchrony in Virtual Reality (VR). The experiment recruited pairs who were asked to perform finger-tracking exercises in VR with three different gaze conditions: averted, direct, and natural, while their brain activity was recorded. We found that gaze direction has a significant effect on inter-brain synchrony during collaboration for this task in VR. This shows that representing natural gaze could influence inter-brain synchrony in VR, which may have implications for avatar design for social VR. We discuss implications of our research and possible directions for future work.},

	abstract     = {Over the past decade, initiatives to design for subjective well-being have gained increased attention and momentum in design research. These initiatives often draw from positive psychology to explore ways of making Positive Psychology Interventions (PPIs) more effective through technology. This paper explores how a mix of tangible and digital technology can realize activity-focused, diverse Emotion Regulation (ER) for its users. We propose that ER strategies can serve as a principle for designing technology that encourages users to savor, modify, reassess, or commemorate their experiences. By centering the design around music listening experiences, the paper explores how users can be supported to lower motivation hurdles that get in the way of frequent engagement with a PPI by developing three exploratory prototypes and reflecting on the development processes. Variapsody, a music listening device, integrates three features, each deploying a different set of ER strategies that make the experience more enjoyable and meaningful. Variapsody's regulatory diversity offers users the choice of how to approach music listening and expands their repertoire of ER strategies. The first feature, Reaction Tile, inscribes users’ reactions to music onto a tangible, domino-sized tile to encourage them to savor the music. The second is Monofilter, which purposefully muffles the salience of background music while working on a cognitively demanding task. Vibelist is the third feature that helps users capture and revisit the context of music listening experiences in a digital collage. The paper discusses the lessons learned and future research opportunities.},

We present the first measurement study of Apple privacy nutrition labels to understand how apps on the U.S. App Store create and update privacy labels. We collected weekly snapshots of the privacy label and other metadata for all the 1.4 million apps on the U.S. App Store from April 2 to November 5, 2021. Our analysis showed that 51.6% of apps still do not have a privacy label as of November 5, 2021. Although 35.3% of old apps have created a privacy label, only 2.7% of old apps created a privacy label without app updates (i.e., voluntary adoption). Our findings suggest that inactive apps have little incentive to create privacy labels.},

We also present an eye-tracking study that compares continuous, discrete, and no guide in a basic drawing task. Our experiment asks participants to draw a circle and a line using three different guide types, three different sizes and two different orientations. Results indicate that discrete guides are more user-friendly than continuous guides, as the majority of participants preferred their use, while we found no difference in speed/accuracy compared to continuous guides. Potentially, this can be attributed to distinct eye-gaze strategies, as discrete guides led users to shift their eyes more frequently between guide points and the drawing cursor. Our insights are useful for practitioners and researchers in 3D sketching, as they are a first step to inform future design applications of how visual guides inside the virtual environment affect visual behaviour and how eye-gaze can become a tool to assist sketching.},

This element provides transparency as to why feedback was shown at any given moment, and can increase cooperation and empowerment for both the teacher and the children.

We explored whether augmenting everyday objects with autonomous capabilities can facilitate an opening-encounter between strangers. A pair of robotic bar-stools were designed to rotate participants sitting on them. We evaluated the opening-encounter experience in three conditions: bar-stools rotating participants towards one another; bar-stools rotating participants away from one another; and bar-stools with no rotation. Our initial findings indicate that rotating participants towards each other led to positive encounters, encouraged social interaction, and increased interpersonal communication. The other two conditions were less likely to initiate social interactions. This preliminary study highlights the potential of facilitating positive opening-encounters using autonomous furniture that are perceived as a natural part of the interaction, without altering its human-human nature.},

Through 19 semi-structured interviews with participants from six Southeast Asian countries and analyzing the data using thematic analysis, we surfaced that our participants started learning different technology with great enthusiasm and used them for their mental well-being during the pandemic period. This paper portrays how our participants enhanced interpersonal bonding, cultivated self-care and creative outlets, and facilitated positivism around their social circle using different technology platforms to mitigate their stress and uncertainty during the pandemic. Our participants’ technology usage for better mental well-being during the COVID-19 period provides HCI researchers with valuable design guidelines.

To answer these questions, we conducted a topic modeling analysis of 223,815 tweets that used the hashtag #facebookdown during the major Facebook outage on 10/4/2021. We uncovered 10 major themes of users’ reactions towards social media outage. Results showed that most users complained, mocked and showed desperation about the outage situation, and during the outage period, increased their quest for other social-media alternatives. Also, surprisingly, many users celebrated the detox from Facebook rather than wishing it to come back as soon as possible. Results offer design implications for practitioners who would like to better respond to future outages.},

As locative media such as Location-Based Games (LBG) begins to rise in prominence, digital LDA becomes increasingly appealing. In this paper, we explore the impacts of LBA on small businesses in the LBG Pok\'{e}mon GO, a lacuna in the literature. We gather participant experience through a collection of 35 semi-structured interviews with businesses leveraging Niantic’s sponsored location LBA. These testimonies indicate (1) participant businesses found LBG advertising to be satisfactory, (2) LBG advertising improves brand recognizability for local commerce, and (3) local community is an important factor for success in LBG advertising. These findings indicate future patterns for integrating local businesses into LBG like Pok\'{e}mon GO, suggesting potential for LBG advertising to assist local businesses.},

Someone with UEI has reduced use of their shoulders, upper arms, forearms, hands, and/or fingers. We conducted six (6) semi-structured interviews with participants with UEI in the US. We found that people with UEI increased computing device use during COVID-19 not only for remote interactions but also in person. Additionally, social distancing for COVID-19 safety created the need for new assistive technology (AT), authentication requirements, and communication platforms, which introduced their own accessibility barriers. We also found that personal protective equipment (PPE) created new barriers during computing device use, which often caused people with UEI to choose COVID-19 safety over the usability of their computing devices. Based on these findings, we describe future opportunities to make computing devices more accessible for people with UEI to manage the shifts in computing device use introduced by COVID-19.},

Understanding physical and behavioural aspects of robot design is important to promote acceptance in human-robot interaction. In this study, we focus on robot initiative-taking as a behavioural aspect and investigate how it influences human perception and emotion during human-robot interaction. We built on previous work using questionnaires to evaluate user impressions in the presence or absence of robot activeness (initiative-taking). We also used Galvanic skin response (GSR) as a physiological measure to gauge participants’ emotion during interaction. Questionnaire analysis confirmed that generally active robot behaviour improved human impression. Moreover, the order of interaction seems to matter for participants to take more notice of robot initiative-taking. GSR analysis supported the questionnaire results, showing that on average participants were more emotionally aroused during an active interaction and that order of interaction somewhat mattered.},

We demonstrate the possibility of using flashcard along with an expressive holographic agent on vocabulary learning. Users scan a flashcard and play an animation that is connected with an emotion related to the word they are seeing. Our goal is to propose an alternative to the traditional use of flashcards, and also introduce another way of using AR in the association process.},

In this study, we analyze social media users’ behaviors by means of a user journey. We create VisualBubble, a design probe that encourages reflection-oriented user experiences during news consumption on social media. We test our design probe with 10 users, to determine its effectiveness in increasing users’ critical reflection on their news consumption behaviors. The initial findings show that VisualBubble can contribute to more critical attitudes towards the news that users are exposed to and, therefore, has the potential to mitigate social media misinformation.},

Through SEACHI (Southeast Asian CHI) Symposium, we aim to grow awareness in HCI and UX to improve the design and development of technology for a living and bring together the Southeast Asian academic researchers and industry practitioners. As HCI is maturing in Asia, we identified the remarkable growth and needs of HCI in the Southeast Asian community. In this symposium, we have several questions that we would like to answer: To what extent the HCI and UX that has been taught and practiced in Southeast Asia met the needs to support the digital transformation initiatives in the region; whether there has been any significant and proper contextualization of the HCI and UX fields; whether HCI and UX are still perceived as a Western mindset instead of a localized approach to make a difference in any projects; whether HCI and UX have become a standard norm in the digital product and design process and how HCI and UX players in Southeast Asia have worked together to create a unique ecosystem. Under the big conference theme “Equity, Justice and Access Commitments,” the symposium aims to bring about equal and fair access for anyone to exchange information and transfer knowledge in this multidisciplinary environment and multi-socioeconomic aspects of research and practice HCI and UX in Southeast Asia.},

This is exacerbated by a general aversion to instruction manuals and a trend towards invisible controls. Consequently, a lack of support for awareness or recognition of interaction possibilities leads to inefficient usage or complete disregard of the system. However, despite standard work imploring that users should be able to “figure out what actions are possible and where and how to perform them”, this problem is rarely considered in the introduction of new interaction methods. My doctoral research is focused on improving the discovery of interaction possibilities. To do so I am combining a theoretical approach, focused on identifying, defining and framing relevant considerations with a practical approach to validate those theoretical considerations and identify and formulate actionable improvement methods for researchers and designers. In the process I hope to highlight the importance of discoverability to the research community and advocate for its increased consideration.},

My thesis focuses on improving online safety and accessibility for people with photosensitivity by measuring the prevalence of seizure-inducing content online, developing new tools for detecting seizure-inducing content, and constructing a broad framework for protecting against seizure-inducing content at the level of content creators, platforms, and content consumers. Through this work, I hope to help build a better understanding of the current state of photosensitive risk online and contribute new solutions for mitigating seizure-inducing content with minimal adverse effects on the browsing experience for users with photosensitivity.},

Personal informatics, chiefly concerned with investigating individuals’ engagement with personal data, has become an area of active research within Human-Computer Interaction. However, more recent research has argued that personal informatics solutions often place high demands on individuals and require knowledge, skills, and time for engaging with personal data. New advances in Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can help to reduce the cognitive burden of personal informatics and identify meaningful trends using analytical engines. Furthermore, introducing ML and AI can enable systems that provide more direct support for action, for example through predictions and recommendations. However, there are many open questions as to the design of personal informatics technologies that incorporate ML and AI.

Combating these new forms of fake media requires tools and interventions understanding the new context. In this case, designers and developers of these tools need to examine user experience and perspectives on new contexts and understand multidisciplinary view points before designing any tools. This workshop calls for multidisciplinary participation to interrogate the current landscape of misinformation tools and to work towards understanding nuances of user experience of these new fake media and perceptions of tools that support users to distinguish credible from inaccurate content.

We collected stress-related physiology data (i.e., heart-rate variability) from wearable sensors and anonymously visualized them on a shared display. Although the physiological data collection where noisy due to the practical constraints in the field settings, we found the participants still increasingly agreed with the systems and used the visualization as a reference for their subjective stress assessment. We also present and discuss how groups of office workers individually and socially reflect on their one-week experiences and then summarize takeaways for designing shared physiological data visualization systems for group stress management in the long term.},

However, in developing countries, the high cost and lack of access make them impractical. In this work, we describe our experience improving access to tactile graphics and drawing in Colombia. We created low-cost, effective and efficient, tactile graphics and drawing techniques that improve on current solutions. These techniques were created from the best practices of two projects adapting pieces from the Colombian art heritage&nbsp;[52, 53] for blind and visually impaired people. They were then applied to a third project: running a virtual tactile drawing club with blind and visually impaired participants in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic. The lessons learned from these experiences are presented in this paper with the hope they can help the community democratize access to tactile graphics.},

By introducing complementary user experience (UX) metrics that are focused on user outcomes, UX teams have greater insight into measuring the successes or challenges of their users in the context of use. This case study describes and discusses the process employed and the lessons learned while designing and implementing a user-centered in-product feedback system. We specifically call out challenges and opportunities around aligning with business outcomes, navigating current frameworks, unlocking self-serve data to stakeholders, informing strategy, and feeding additional research. In conclusion, we present these learnings as a framework, dubbed BLUE, to help other UX teams create in-product feedback mechanisms.},

	abstract     = {Multimodal Interfaces (MMIs) supporting the synergistic use of natural modalities like speech and gesture have been conceived as promising for spatial or 3D interactions, e.g., in Virtual, Augmented, and Mixed Reality (XR for short). Yet, the currently prevailing user interfaces are unimodal. Commercially available software platforms like the Unity or Unreal game engines simplify the complexity of developing XR applications through appropriate tool support. They provide ready-to-use device integration, e.g., for 3D controllers or motion tracking, and according interaction techniques such as menus, (3D) point-and-click, or even simple symbolic gestures to rapidly develop unimodal interfaces. A comparable tool support is yet missing for multimodal solutions in this and similar areas. We believe that this hinders user-centered research based on rapid prototyping of MMIs, the identification and formulation of practical design guidelines, the development of killer applications highlighting the power of MMIs, and ultimately a widespread adoption of MMIs. This article investigates potential reasons for the ongoing uncommonness of MMIs. Our case study illustrates and analyzes lessons learned during the development and application of a toolchain that supports rapid development of natural and synergistic MMIs for XR use-cases. We analyze the toolchain in terms of developer usability, development time, and MMI customization. This analysis is based on the knowledge gained in years of research and academic education. Specifically, it reflects on the development of appropriate MMI tools and their application in various demo use-cases, in user-centered research, and in the lab work of a mandatory MMI course of an HCI master’s program. The derived insights highlight successful choices made as well as potential areas for improvement.},

Failing to recognize playfulness causes user dissatisfaction and abandonment, destroying the precious rapport with the CA.

This contribution presents a preliminary investigation in Bulgaria, Greece, Italy, and Romania to understand middle school teachers’ perspective on how to best teach digital competencies for AI. It uses the Will, Skill, Tool model as a theoretical lens, and it aims to inform the design of educational content and online platforms to enable teachers to integrate AI education into their classroom. Through a human-centred design process – including focus groups and a survey – needs and requirements were identified for a supportive online educational platform that aids teachers in AI education. The research results showed a positive attitude towards AI education and high motivation to introduce AI-related content at school, which translates to a positive Will factor. Regarding the Skill factor, teachers seem to have a basic level of digital skills but low AI-related skills. No significant problems emerged regarding the availability of resources, but further research investigating whether the Tool factor is accounted for would be desirable. Based on the results, six design implications for a web-based educational platform on AI have been formulated: (i) provide the required basics; (ii) make it relevant; (iii) make it interactive and collaborative; (iv) keep everyone in the loop; (v) make it accessible; (vi) motivate the user. These implications are further discussed to extend computational thinking frameworks to incorporate AI-related concepts and perspectives.},

Despite the fact that there exist customized services for a variety of commodities, these services are generally expensive and such customization for physical artifacts is not accessible by average users. In this work, we follow the promise of Programmable Filament [21], a novel technique to enable end-users with low-cost Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) 3D printers to equip multi-material printing capabilities at low investment. We discovered that this technique can be applied to mix mechanical properties of two different materials (e.g., tensility) that may affect user’s comfort in 3D printed objects (e.g., personal optimal softness in sports gear) to meet individual needs. We briefly introduce the process to 3D print programmable filaments using consumer-grade 3D printers in various composition ratios and fabricate 3D printed objects using an FDM printer blending multi-materials in the hot end, present a tensile testing experiment on sample objects made of such filaments to show its feasibility in producing new properties, and demonstrate two real-world applications that can be benefited from Programmable Filament utilization. We conclude with the remaining limitations and discussions about two potential structural improvements to improve printability of this filament for deployment.},

	abstract     = {In recent years, virtual reality (VR) technology has shown promise as a means of delivering rehabilitative care to restore arm function in stroke patients. At the same time, limitations of traditional clinical scales for measuring arm function recovery have led to the more widespread use of kinematic metrics. These metrics quantify useful properties of patients’ movements using motion tracking data captured while the patient performs different types of assessment tasks. Given modern consumer VR systems already collect the data needed to calculate many common kinematic metrics, these systems could eventually be used to both deliver stroke rehabilitation programs and administer kinematic assessments to monitor patients’ recovery. However, it is not yet clear how the properties of VR-based assessment tasks may systematically impact the values of kinematic metrics used to assess arm function post-stroke. To begin addressing this question, we examined the influence of two task properties (movement direction and hand dominance) on a set of 10 kinematic metrics during a discrete reaching task performed by healthy participants using an Oculus Quest 2 VR headset. Our findings indicate that all 10 metrics were significantly impacted by these task properties, confirming that kinematic metrics captured in this context are sensitive to task properties. Our results also provide an initial account of how the metrics were influenced by each task property and highlight needs for future work to further understand the influence of assessment task properties on VR-based kinematic assessments.},

We conducted an outdoor experiment (N = 13) using an Augmented Reality simulation and compared these types of warnings in terms of reaction time, accident rate, and feeling of safety. Our results indicate that AR and auditory warnings lead to shorter reaction times, have a better perception, and create a better feeling of safety than vibrotactile warnings. Moreover, auditory signals have a higher acceptance by the riders compared to the other two types of warnings.},

However, it is challenging for founders to find the most potential investors and successfully raise money for their projects on crowdfunding platforms. A few machine learning based methods have been proposed to recommend investors’ interest in a specific crowdfunding project, but they fail to provide project founders with explanations in detail for these recommendations, thereby leading to an erosion of trust in predicted investors. To help crowdfunding founders find truly interested investors, we conducted semi-structured interviews with four crowdfunding experts and presents inSearch, a visual analytic system. inSearch allows founders to search for investors interactively on crowdfunding platforms. It supports an effective overview of potential investors by leveraging a Graph Neural Network to model investor preferences. Besides, it enables interactive exploration and comparison of the temporal evolution of different investors’ investment details.},

	abstract     = {Novel voice enhancements for larynx amputees utilize a variety of wearable interfaces and/or artificial intelligence. However, the problem formulation remains posed as “voice restoration”, which stems from common, but limiting, assumptions about communication as a reliable signal transfer, in which “signal” equals to voice. Yet beyond this signal transfer, the vital part of communication is mutual influence. During conversations people coordinate their movement dynamics, i.e. adjust speech timing, intonation and gestures. By taking this perspective, informed by the newest trends in the cognitive sciences (ecological, enacted, extended cognition) as well as recent studies on human-machine integration, we seek to shed new light on the processes of analysis and evaluation of specific systems for laryngectomees. We propose the integrated framework which enables us to interpret bionic communicative interfaces as parts of distributed cognitive systems that allow for different level of control over interactions. This paper analyses 5 bionic systems, consisting of a laryngectomee supported with i) voice copy, ii) voice conversion, iii) silent speech iv) bionic voice or v) lean-AI interfaces. We demonstrate how using the broader perspective leads to noticing important aspects of communication and informs a more human-centered design and evaluation.CCS CONCEPTS • Human-centered computing → Human computer interaction (HCI) → HCI theory, concepts and models • Human-centered computing → Interaction design → Interaction design theory, concepts and paradigms},

We found that, while Copilot did not necessarily improve the task completion time or success rate, most participants preferred to use Copilot in daily programming tasks, since Copilot often provided a useful starting point and saved the effort of searching online. However, participants did face difficulties in understanding, editing, and debugging code snippets generated by Copilot, which significantly hindered their task-solving effectiveness. Finally, we highlighted several promising directions for improving the design of Copilot based on our observations and participants’ feedback.},

This phenomenon has been widely observed to exist especially against an objectively correct answer—in face-to-face and online interaction alike. To a lesser extent, studies have investigated the conformity effect in settings based on personal opinions and feelings; thus, in settings where an objectively right or wrong answer does not exist. In such settings, the direction of conformity tends to play a role in whether an individual will conform. While cultural differences in conformity behavior have been observed repeatedly in settings with an objectively correct answer, the role of culture has not been explored yet for settings with subjective topics. Hence, the focus of this study is on how conformity develops across cultures for such cases. We developed an online experiment in which participants needed to reach a positive group consensus on adding a song to a music playlist. After seeing the group members’ ratings, the participants had the opportunity to revise their own. Our findings suggest that the willingness to flip to a positive outcome was far less than to a negative outcome. Overall, conformity behavior was far less pronounced for participants from the United Kingdom compared to participants from India.},

We extracted mouse behaviors from a Robot Operating System (ROS) file-based dataset that user responses are reproducible. We analyzed redundant mouse movements to complete a dual n-back game by solely pressing the left and right buttons. Starting from a hypothesis that unconscious mouse behaviors predict different levels of cognitive loads, we statistically analyzed mouse movements. We also validated mouse behaviors with other modalities in the dataset, including self-questionnaire and eye blinking results. As a result, we found that mouse behaviors that occur unconsciously and human cognitive workload correlate.},

Lifestyle programs for transmural and remote care are everywhere, facilitated by hospitals as part of rehabilitation, by general practitioners as preventative measures, and more and more commonly, by various private (health) organizations through app stores. What might often be overlooked is the time and energy that is spent on the creation of the content in these programs. In this article, we discuss the elaborate content creation process of lifestyle content for an outpatient clinic for patients scheduled for an ablation surgery. We describe the close collaboration between the clinicians and our design research team, and reflect on how to streamline and formalize this process.},

A follow-up experiment confirms that slowing down does improve the accuracy of these methods. Both methods yield the best accuracy rates when speaking at 0.75x of the actual speaking rate. A post-hoc error analysis revealed that speech and silent speech methods and native and non-native speakers are susceptible to different types of errors.},

To adapt to the changing climate, Detroit is modernizing its sewer infrastructure, adding sensors, robotics, and advanced algorithms that have the potential to increase the capacity and adaptability of its sewer system. The water utility is struggling, however, to incorporate these new technologies into its existing user workflows. We have conducted a user study of water operators in Detroit focused on understanding how they currently visualize and use one of their most critical data sources — weather data. Based on our findings, we have developed a new weather dashboard that minimizes weather data uncertainty by synthesizing multiple sources. This research aims to inform the design of new data interfaces for water operators, and learn best practices for incorporating uncertain data in data-driven decision-making processes.},

Harmful impacts include but are not limited to disparities in quality-of-service, unequal distribution of resources, erasure, stereotyping and misrepresentation of groups and individuals, they might limit people’s agency or affect their well-being. Given that language tasks are often complex, open-ended, and incorporated across a diversity of applications; effectively foreseeing and mitigating such harms has remained an elusive goal. Towards this goal, Natural Language Processing (NLP) literature has only recently started to engage with human-centered perspectives and methods—that are often central to HCI research. In this panel, we bring together researchers with expertise in both NLP and HCI, as well as in issues that pertain to the fairness, transparency, justice, and ethics of computational systems. Our main goals are to explore 1) how to leverage HCI perspectives and methodologies to help foresee potential harms of language technologies and inform their mitigation, 2) synergies between the HCI and the responsible NLP research that can help build common ground, and 3) complement existing efforts to facilitate conversations between the HCI and NLP communities.},

The player can easily learn to train a classification model and solve tasks by engaging in simple game activities designed according to an ML pipeline. Simple controls, positive rewards, and clear audiovisual feedback makes game easy to play even for novice players. The playtest result showed that players were able to learn basic ML concepts and how data can impact model results, and that the game made ML feel less difficult and more relevant. However, proper debriefing session seems crucial to prevent misinterpretations that may occur in the learning process.},

We construct the map by preserving pairwise distances or by maintaining relative values of specific data attributes. This metaphorical mapping is very flexible and allows us to adapt the visualization to its application and target audience. We present several examples where we map data to different domains and representations. This includes mapping data to cat images, encoding research interests with neural style transfer and representing movies as stars in the night sky. Overall, we find that although metaphors are not as accurate as the traditional techniques, they can help design engaging and personalized visualizations.},

We will also discuss challenges for sensory sketching in remote, collaborative environments and brainstorm suggestions for digital tools.

Having a physical set of structured diary prompts allowed for a period of “thinking as writing”, enabling reflection upon how having expert knowledge may or may not translate into useful knowledge when dealing with everyday life. This is particularly beneficial in the context of home cyber security use, where first-person narratives have not made up part of the research corpus to date, despite a consistent recognition that users struggle to apply strong cyber security methods in personal contexts. The framing of the autoethnographic diary study contributes a very simple, but extremely powerful, tool for anyone with more knowledge than the average user of any technology, enabling the expert to reflect upon how they themselves have fared when using, understanding and discussing the technology in daily life.},

	abstract     = {Augmented Reality Smart Glasses (ARSG) are a recent development in consumer-level personal computing technology. Research on ARSGs has largely focused on new forms of etiquette for these personal computing devices, but little else has been examined due in part to consumer availability. The most well-known example of ARSGs is Google Glass, which are no longer available for consumer purchase due to privacy concerns. Google has more recently transitioned to industry-focused applications with the Glass Enterprise Edition [1]. Recent consumer-facing iterations on the technology include Snapchat Spectacles and Ray-Ban Stories, which reignite some of the anxieties surrounding wearable cameras. Focals by North, the ARSG product studied in this project, do not have the capacity to record video or audio, thus mitigating the risk of privacy breaches. This study examines how users of Focals employ the device, successfully or not, to facilitate daily activities such as scheduling, communication, wayfinding, and how non-users perceive the interactions of Focals users. Participants wrote blog responses and participated in a focus group on their daily experiences with the glasses; they also speculated on potential uses and features of future iterations relating to accessibility and entertainment purposes. Focals by North, a relatively low-cost ARSG, aims to make this tech mass market to “seamlessly [blend] technology into our world” [2]. However, this study found participants preferred choice when receiving notifications, and greatly questioned the need for notifications to appear in their field of vision. We anticipate that these results will inform frameworks for assessing consumer facing ARSG products in future work.},

Our formative studies revealed key challenges ranging from a lack of detail about the study design, hindering comprehensibility, to inconsistencies between preregistrations and published papers. To explore ways for addressing these issues, we developed Ap\'{e}ritif, a research prototype that scaffolds the preregistration process and automatically generates analysis code and a methods description. In an evaluation with 17 HCI researchers, we found that Ap\'{e}ritif reduces the effort of preregistering a study, facilitates researchers’ workflows, and promotes consistency between research artifacts.},

We applied backward design principles to design a low-cost welding simulator in the form of modularized units through active consulting with welding training experts. Using a minimum viable prototype, we conducted a user study with 24 novices to test the system’s usability. Our findings show (1) greater effectiveness of the system in transferring skills to real-world environments as compared to accessible video-based alternatives and, (2) the visuo-haptic guidance during virtual welding enhances performance and provides a realistic learning experience to users.

Mental workload (MWL) is an established concept, and as a form of personal data could be useful for making positive life changes. However, MWL is typically only studied for isolated tasks to avoid overload and underload. We investigated lived experiences of MWL, aiming to understand how tracking such data could implicate our everyday lives. 19 participants, that had previously experienced tracking their mental workload, took part in interviews and an Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis identified four superordinate themes. Results point towards mixed and changing perceptions of MWL and the importance of fluctuating between MWL levels in daily life in terms of performances, perceptions, and wellbeing. These findings are captured in an apparent Cycle, which outside factors can disrupt, and we discuss these cycles in terms of personal informatics and work performance.},

In our survey (N&nbsp;=&nbsp;1195), participants worldwide assigned emotions and intensities to 68 face emojis. According to our results, certain feelings, such as happiness or shock, are visualized by manifold emojis covering a broad spectrum of intensities. Other feelings, such as anger, have limited and only very intense representative visualizations. We further emphasize that the cultural background influences emojis’ perception: for instance, linear-active cultures (e.g., UK, Germany) rate the intensity of such visualizations higher than multi-active (e.g., Brazil, Russia) or reactive cultures (e.g., Indonesia, Singapore).

To investigate these aspects, we implemented two types of VR pair-learning systems, a symmetric system with both peers using VR and an asymmetric system with one using a tablet. In a user study (N=46), the symmetric system statistically significantly provided higher presence, immersion, player experience, and lower intrinsic cognitive load, which are all important for learning. Symmetric and asymmetric systems performed equally well regarding learning outcome, highlighting that both are valuable learning systems. We used these findings to define guidelines on how to design co-located VR pair-learning applications, including characteristics for symmetric and asymmetric systems.},

Our findings contrast researchers’ visions of seamless farming technologies with the seamful realities of their work to produce them. We trace how, when anticipating future use, the seams that researchers themselves experience disappear, other seams are hidden from view by institutional support, and seams end users may face are too distant to be in sight. We develop suggestions for the design of these technologies grounded in a more artful management of seamfulness and seamlessness during the process of design and development.},

To address that, we conducted semi-structured interviews with eight YouTubers with disabilities. We found that they aimed to inform the public of diverse representations of disabilities, which led them to work with algorithms by strategically portraying disability identities.

To investigate the efficiency of these visualizations, we proposed an Augmented Reality simulation as a novel evaluation method, in which the above visualizations are represented as AR, and conducted a controlled experiment with 24 participants indoors.

We contribute a state-based Medication Routine Framework composed of four states (Wellness, New Task, Erratic, and Disruption) in two axes (regularity and time scale). Because most nonadherence due to forgetfulness occurs in nonroutine states (i.e., Erratic and Disruption state), we argue that improving technology for medication adherence requires designing for these states.

Recent research claimed that enterprise applications offer an opportunity for AI innovation at the user experience level. We conducted design workshops to explore the practices of experienced designers who work on cross-functional AI teams in the enterprise. We discussed how designers successfully work with and struggle with AI. Our findings revealed that designers can innovate at the system and service levels. We also discovered that making a case for an AI feature’s return on investment is a barrier for designers when they propose AI concepts and ideas. Our discussions produced novel insights on designers’ role on AI teams, and the boundary objects they used for collaborating with data scientists. We discuss the implications of these findings as opportunities for future research aiming to empower designers in working with data and AI.},

To address this, we propose SATS, a Suggestion-based Accurate Target Selection method, where target selection is formulated as a sequential decision problem. The objective is to maximize the utility: the negative time cost for the entire target selection procedure. The SATS decision process is dictated by a policy generated using reinforcement learning. It automatically decides when to provide suggestions and when to directly select the target. Our user studies show that SATS reduced error rate and selection time over Shift&nbsp;[51], a magnification-based method, and MUCS, a suggestion-based alternative that optimizes the utility for the current selection. SATS also significantly reduced error rate over BayesianCommand&nbsp;[58], which directly selects targets based on posteriors, with only a minor increase in selection time.},

We then ran a within-subjects study (N=32) in a virtual jazz-bar to investigate how heart rate (HR) and breathing rate (BR) visualizations, and signal rate, influence perceived avatar arousal, user distraction, and preferences. Findings show that skeuomorphic visualizations for both biosignals allow differentiable arousal inference; skeuomorphic and particles were least distracting for HR, whereas all were similarly distracting for BR; biosignal perceptions often depend on avatar relations, entertainment type, and emotion inference of avatars versus spaces. We contribute HR and BR visualizations, and considerations for designing social VR entertainment biosignal visualizations.},

We introduce the notion of a perspective continuum in VR, which is technically related to the camera position and conceptually to how users perceive their environment in VR. A perspective continuum enables adapting and manipulating the sense of agency and involvement in the virtual world. This flexibility of perspectives broadens the design space of VR experiences through deliberately manipulating perception. In a study, we explore users’ attitudes, experiences and perceptions while controlling a virtual character from the two known perspectives. Statistical analysis of the empirical results shows the existence of a perspective continuum in VR. Our findings can be used to design experiences based on shifts of perception.},

Additionally, we present an inductive thematic analysis, which highlights non-disclosure as a central theme, i.e., adolescents remaining unaware of their HIV status. Drawing from these findings, we discuss how to account for (the lack of) disclosure in the design of technology to support HIV management, and reflect on whether technology could (and should) support the process. We further highlight the risks that researchers and designers need to be aware of when designing HIV management technology for this audience.},

In this paper, we explore how an embodied, in-situ intervention in the form of a smart toy can impact emotion-related parent-child interactions in the home. We draw on (1) interviews with 29 parents of young children who had the smart toy for at least 1 month; (2) co-design workshops with 12 parents and 8 parenting course facilitators. We discuss how the smart toy impacted parent-child interactions around emotions for a subset of families, and draw on workshop data to explore how this could be designed for directly. Finally, we propose a set of design directions for technology-enabled systems aiming to elicit and scaffold specific parent-child interactions over time.},

Taking a situated lens, we embarked on a multiple case study of four schools who were aiming to adopt a new literacy game in the classroom. Through interviews with technology leaders and fieldnotes from our site observations, we systematically analysed their actions and concerns over two academic terms. This highlighted an overwhelming concern with managing the material dimension of the technology, teacher agency and division of labour and mechanisms for communication and monitoring.

These qualitative practices can often lack transparency that can present a problem for stakeholders (such as funding agencies) who seek evidence of the rigour and accountability in these decision-making processes. When qualitative research is done digitally, paradata is available as interaction logs that reveal the underlying processes, such as the time spent engaging with different segments of an interview. In practice, paradata is seldom used to examine the decisions associated with undertaking qualitative research. This paper explores the role of paradata arising from a four-month engagement with a community-led charity that used a digital platform to support their qualitative co-research project. Through observations of platform use and reflective post-deployment interviews, our findings highlight examples of paradata generated through digital tools in qualitative research, e.g., listening coverage, engagement rate, thematic maps and data discards. From this, we contribute a conceptualisation of paradata and discuss its role in qualitative research to improve process transparency, enhance data sharing, and to create feedback loops with research participants.},

	abstract     = {Information extraction (IE) approaches often play a pivotal role in text analysis and require significant human intervention. Therefore, a deeper understanding of existing IE practices and related challenges from a human-in-the-loop perspective is warranted. In this work, we conducted semi-structured interviews in an industrial environment and analyzed the reported IE approaches and limitations. We observed that data science workers often follow an iterative task model consisting of information foraging and sensemaking loops across all the phases of an IE workflow. The task model is generalizable and captures diverse goals across these phases (e.g., data preparation, modeling, evaluation.) We found several limitations in both foraging (e.g., data exploration) and sensemaking (e.g., qualitative debugging) loops stemming from a lack of adherence to existing cognitive engineering principles. Moreover, we identified that due to the iterative nature of an IE workflow, the requirement of provenance is often implied but rarely supported by existing systems. Based on these findings, we discuss design implications for supporting IE workflows and future research directions.},

Writing extensible software remains challenging, even for expert programmers. Reprogramming or extending existing software is often laborious or wholly blocked, requiring sophisticated knowledge of application architecture or setting up a development environment. We present Varv, a programming model representing reprogrammable interactive software as a declarative data structure. Varv defines interactive applications as a set of concepts that consist of a schema and actions. Applications in Varv support incremental modification, allowing users to reprogram through addition and selectively suppress, modify, or add behavior. Users can define high-level concepts, creating an abstraction layer and effectively a domain-specific language for their application domain, emphasizing reuse and modification. We demonstrate the reprogramming and collaboration capabilities of Varv in two case studies and illustrate how the event engine allows for extensive tooling support.},

Building on this work, this study analyzes the relatively understudied phenomenon of caste in computing. Contrary to common rhetorics of ‘castelessness,’ we show how computing worlds in India and Indian diasporic communities continue to be shaped and inflected by caste relations. We study how, when and where Dalits (formerly ‘untouchables’) encounter caste in computing. We show how they artfully navigate these caste inscriptions by interpreting, interrupting and ambiguating caste and by finding caste communities. Drawing on the life stories of 16 Dalit engineers and anti-caste, queer-feminist and critical race theories, we argue that a dynamic and performative approach to caste, and other forms of inequality in HCI and computing, emphasizes the artfulness and agency of those at the margins as they challenge structural inequality in everyday life. Lastly, we suggest practical ways of addressing caste to build more open and inclusive cultures of global computing.},

We organized a formal workshop with 19 participants and four solo DIY trials to evaluate the capability of the toolkit, the overall user engagement, the creations in both sessions, and the iterative suggestions.

This paper presents five biodata-based case studies demonstrating how design researchers can create knowledge about human bodies and behaviors via strategies that allow them to engage data diffractively. These studies suggest that designers can find insights for designing with data as it is lived by working with it in a slow, open-ended fashion that leaves room for messiness and time for discovering difference.

We address this problem by creating two new colour patterns (ColourIconizer, ColourMix). We evaluated these patterns against a previously published colour pattern (ColourMeters) using an online evaluation with three new colour identification tasks (Selection Task, Transition Task, Sorting Task). ColourMeters helped with the Transition Task, but struggled with the Selection and Sorting Tasks. Conversely, ColourIconizer helped with the Selection and Sorting Tasks but struggled to help on the Transition Task. ColourMix provided general assistance on all tasks. Our combined results help inform and improve the design of future colour patterns.},

To further investigate eudaimonic PX we interviewed 24 games players about ‘significant or memorable emotional experiences’ from their games playing and used grounded theory to analyse their responses. This led to the construction of the concept of ‘emotional exploration’ which is used to help explain (i) why players would seek out a eudaimonic PX, (ii) how eudaimonic PX is constituted and (iii) how developers can design for a eudaimonic PX.

In this paper, we present a gesture elicitation study aimed at understanding the impact of increased production. We show that users refine the most promising gestures and that how long it takes to find promising gestures varies by participant. We also show that gestural refinements provide insight into the gestural features that matter for users to assign semantic meaning and discuss implications for training gesture classifiers.},

As an approach to address this gap, we hosted a series of online workshops, soliciting 15 participants to engage in grounded speculations on plausible futures of DNA data storage. Themes drawn from the resulting imaginaries and discussions were situated within a selection of existing HCI literature, to generate an initial set of design opportunities and challenges for DNA data storage. Early analysis suggests that the system could be designed to 1) facilitate meaningful interactions that are intangible and molecular, and 2) foster better human relationship with more-than-human entities.

	abstract     = {(Dis)Appearables is an approach for actuated Tangible User Interfaces (TUIs) to appear and disappear. This technique is supported by Stages: physical platforms inspired by theatrical stages. Self-propelled TUI’s autonomously move between front and back stage allowing them to dynamically appear and disappear from users’ attention. This platform opens up a novel interaction design space for expressive displays with dynamic physical affordances. We demonstrate and explore this approach based on a proof-of-concept implementation using two-wheeled robots, and multiple stage design examples. We have implemented a stage design pipeline which allows users to plan and design stages that are composed with front and back stages, and transition portals such as trap doors or lifts. The pipeline includes control of the robots, which guides them on and off stage. With this proof-of-concept prototype, we demonstrated a range of applications including interactive mobility simulation, self re-configuring desktops, remote hockey, and storytelling/gaming. Inspired by theatrical stage designs, this is a new take on ‘controlling the existence of matter’ for user experience design.},

In studies with computer science researchers, this approach helps users discover authors considered useful for generating novel research directions. We also demonstrate an approach for displaying information about authors, boosting the ability to understand the work of new, unfamiliar scholars.

To address this need, we present Tisane, a mixed-initiative system for authoring generalized linear models with and without mixed-effects. Tisane introduces a study design specification language for expressing and asking questions about relationships between variables. Tisane contributes an interactive compilation process that represents relationships in a graph, infers candidate statistical models, and asks follow-up questions to disambiguate user queries to construct a valid model. In case studies with three researchers, we find that Tisane helps them focus on their goals and assumptions while avoiding past mistakes.},

Participants with visual choice experienced higher avatar identification and autonomy. Participants with audial choice experienced higher avatar identification and autonomy, but only within the group of participants who had visual choice available. Visual choice led to an increase in time spent, and indirectly led to increases in intrinsic motivation, immersion, time spent, future play motivation, and likelihood of game recommendation. Audial choice moderated the majority of these effects. Our results suggest that audial customization plays an important enhancing role vis-\`{a}-vis visual customization.

This paper collects data on 8,028 maintainers, 13,555 sponsors, and 22,515 sponsorships and conducts a comprehensive analysis. We explore the relationship between the Sponsor mechanism and developers along four dimensions using a combination of qualitative and quantitative analysis, examining why developers participate, how the mechanism affects developer activity, who obtains more sponsorships, and what mechanism flaws developers have encountered in the process of using it. We find a long-tail effect in the act of sponsorship, with most maintainers’ expectations remaining unmet, and sponsorship has only a short-term, slightly positive impact on development activity but is not sustainable. While sponsors participate in this mechanism mainly as a means of thanking the developers of OSS that they use, in practice, the social status of developers is the primary influence on the number of sponsorships. We find that both the Sponsor mechanism and open source donations have certain shortcomings and need further improvements to attract more participants.},

The results showed that social ratings and reviews could alter participants’ preferences and affect their status of attention, working memory, and emotion.

In this system, we propose a method that employs two projectors equipped with polarizers and a multi-layered screen comprising an anti-reflective plate, transparent screen, and wire grid polarizer. The multi-layered screen changes whether the projected image is shown on the front or rear side of the screen depending on the polarization direction of the incident light. Hence, the proposed method can project images on the front, rear, or both sides of the screen by projecting images from either or both projectors using polarizers. In addition, the proposed method can be easily deployed by simply attaching multiple optical films. We implement a prototype and confirm that the proposed method can selectively switch the projection surface.},

Personal Informatics (PI) systems augmented by algorithms and sensors have become popular ways to help users collect and reflect on data about stress. While prediction algorithms in the PI systems are mainly for diagnostic purposes, few studies examine how the explainability of algorithmic prediction can support user-driven self-insight. To this end, we developed MindScope, an algorithm-assisted stress management system that determines user stress levels and explains how the stress level was computed based on the user’s everyday activities captured by a smartphone. In a 25-day field study conducted with 36 college students, the prediction and explanation supported self-reflection, a process to re-establish preconceptions about stress by identifying stress patterns and recalling past stress levels and patterns that led to coping planning. We discuss the implications of exploiting prediction algorithms that facilitate user-driven retrospection in PI systems.},

Drawing on environmental studies, we outline key concepts of environmental stewardship – namely actors, capacity, and motivations – to unpack how different initiatives for handling waste are organised, both through grassroots and top-down interventions, and through varying sociotechnical configurations. We use these dimensions to analyse three different cases of waste management that illustrate how actions of care for the environment are ecologically organised, and what challenges might hinder them beyond –or besides– behavioural motivations. We conclude with a discussion on the orientation to action that the suggested framework provides, and its role in understanding, designing and assessing digital technologies in this domain. We argue that examining how stewardship actions fold into each other helps design sociotechnical interventions for managing waste from within a relational perspective.},

We conduct two co-design workshops with screen reader users to define design principles that guide the structure, content, and duration of a data narrative. Based on these principles and relevant auditory processing characteristics, we propose a dynamic programming approach to automatically generate an audio data narrative from a given dataset. We evaluate our approach with 16 screen reader users. Findings show with audio narratives, users gain significantly more insights from the data. Users describe data narratives help them better extract and comprehend the information in both the sonification and description.},

We used a speed-dating design method to allow 43 participants to rapidly compare 48 types of OSI restriction in various conversational contexts. We identified two “tug-of-wars” that take place when attention management is integrated into IM apps: one between fulfilling one’s contacts’ expectations and protecting one’s own attention, and the other, between protecting one’s privacy and asserting the justifiability of using communication restrictions. We also highlighted the participants’ desire to be diplomatic for sustaining their positive images and maintaining relational connectedness. Finally, we provide design recommendations for integrating attention management into IM apps.},

Primarily, these applications support asynchronous activities, such as information portals or forums to access rural journalism, but opportunities for real-time experience sharing remain largely under-explored. In this paper, we explore the potential of such forums to support remote mentoring of NGO volunteers, a practice that requires synchronous, dialogical formats for experience sharing and peer discussion. We engaged 28 participants from a rural Indian NGO in the design of peer-mentoring sessions that leverage synchronous audio discussions, using the structure and format of traditional talk-show radio as a starting point. The participants favored an entertaining approach to mentoring and discussed the logistics required to achieve this within their resource constraints. We conclude with design implications for designing media-driven community engagement platforms and the ethical challenges around protecting marginalized community interests.},

In the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries implemented digital contact tracing to contain the coronavirus outbreak. However, the adoption rates vary significantly across different countries. In this study, we investigate Chinese people’s adoption of digital contact tracing. We aim at finding the influence of Chinese culture on people’s attitudes and behaviors toward the technology. We interviewed 26 Chinese participants and used thematic analysis to interpret the data. Our findings showed that Chinese culture shaped citizens’ interactions with the digital contact tracing at multiple levels; driven by the culture, Chinese citizens accepted digital contact tracing and contributed to making digital contact tracing a socio-technical infrastructure of people’s daily lives. We also discuss such cultural influences with the growing literature of human infrastructure and crisis informatics.},

In this paper we present an exploration of natural gestures, followed by their implementation in a VR application and co-design of new gestures with a marginalized San community in Namibia. This study contributes to the still scarce empirical work in user-driven gesture design research, aiming to reduce legacy bias, on a methodological and technical level as well as through engaging non-WEIRD participants. Our findings confirm the applicability of our method, combined with Partner and Priming suggested by Morris et al., to the design of gestures inspired by natural interactions. We also consider the implementation of user-designed gestures to be necessary to asses usability, usefulness and technical issues in VR. Furthermore, the research directly advances the HCI agenda for diversity, through an ongoing research and design partnership with an indigenous community in Southern Africa, thereby challenging systemic bias and promoting design for the pluriverse.},

In this study, we consider this contrast in relation to worker communication patterns. We demonstrate the heterogeneous effects of standardization versus personalization across different stages of a project and examine the relative impact on job acquisition, project completion, and earnings.

Inspirational communication therefore appears as central to the process of leader emergence in virtual teams, even in a setting like OSS, where technical contributions have often been conceptualized as the sole pathway to gaining community recognition.

However, current haptic shape rendering devices generally focus on feedback of virtual objects, and require the users to put down or take off those devices to perceive real objects. Therefore, we propose FingerX to render haptic shapes and enable users to touch, grasp and interact with virtual and real objects simultaneously. An extender on the fingertip extends to a corresponding height to support between the fingertip and the real objects or the hand, to render virtual shapes. A ring rotates and withdraws the extender behind the fingertip when touching real objects. By independently controlling four extenders and rings on each finger with the exception of the pinky finger, FingerX renders feedback in three common scenarios, including touching virtual objects augmented by real environments (e.g.,&nbsp;a desk), grasping virtual objects augmented by real objects (e.g.,&nbsp;a bottle) and grasping virtual objects in the hand. We conducted a shape recognition study to evaluate the recognition rates for these three scenarios and obtained an average recognition rate of 76.59% with shape visual feedback. We then performed a VR study to observe how users interact with virtual and real objects simultaneously and verify that FingerX significantly enhances VR realism, compared to current vibrotactile methods.},

	abstract     = {Ridesharing services do not make data of their availability (supply, utilization, idle time, and idle distance) and surge pricing publicly available. It limits the opportunities to study the spatiotemporal trends of the availability and surge pricing of these services. Only a few research studies conducted in North America analyzed these features for only Uber and Lyft. Despite the interesting observations, the results of prior works are not generalizable or reproducible because: i) the datasets collected in previous publications are spatiotemporally sensitive, i.e., previous works do not represent the current availability and surge pricing of ridesharing services in different parts of the world; and ii) the analyses presented in previous works are limited in scope (in terms of countries and ridesharing services they studied). Hence, prior works are not generally applicable to ridesharing services operating in different countries. This paper addresses the issue of ridesharing-data unavailability by presenting Ridesharing Measurement Suite (RMS). RMS removes the barrier of entry for analyzing the availability and surge pricing of ridesharing services for ridesharing users, researchers from various scientific domains, and regulators. RMS continuously collects the data of the availability and surge pricing of ridesharing services. It exposes real-time data of these services through i) graphical user interfaces and ii) public APIs to assist various stakeholders of these services and simplify the data collection and analysis process for future ridesharing research studies. To signify the utility of RMS, we deployed RMS to collect and analyze the availability and surge pricing data of 10 ridesharing services operating in nine countries for eight weeks in pre and during pandemic periods. Using the data collected and analyzed by RMS, we identify that previous articles miscalculated the utilization of ridesharing services as they did not count in the vehicles driving in multiple categories of the same service. We observe that during COVID-19, the supply of ridesharing services decreased by 54%, utilization of available vehicles increased by 6%, and a 5 \texttimes{} increase in the surge frequency of services. We also find that surge occurs in a small geographical region, and its intensity reduces by 50% in about 0.5 miles away from the location of a surge. We present several other interesting observations on ridesharing services’ availability and surge pricing.},

Informed by interviews and observations, we designed a zoomorphic floor cleaning robot which playfully interacts with care home residents affected by dementia. A field study shows that playful interaction can facilitate the introduction of utilitarian robots in care homes, being nonthreatening and easy to make sense of. Residents previously reacted with distress to a Roomba robot, but were now amused by and played with our cartoonish cat robot or simply tolerated its presence. They showed awareness of the machine-nature of the robot, even while engaging in pretend-play. A playful approach to the design of functional robots can thus explicitly conceptualize such robots as social actors in their context of use.},

Drawing upon a communication model of interactivity, we designed a data-rich site with three different types of interactive features—namely, modality interactivity, message interactivity, and source interactivity—and empirically tested their relative and combined effects on user engagement and user experience with a 2 (modality) \texttimes{} 3 (source) \texttimes{} 2 (message) field experiment (N =166). Findings shed light on how interface designers, online news editors and journalists can maximize user engagement with data-rich news content.

More than technical, we contend that data annotation is a systematic exercise of power through organizational structure and practice.

The results show, however, that the scales were not independent of each other. Combining perspicuity, efficiency, and dependability to pragmatic aspects as well as novelty and stimulation to hedonic aspects of UX improved the model fit significantly. The systematic variations of product properties and correlations with the System Usability Scale (SUS) in a second experiment with N=499 participants supported the validity of these two factors.

We demonstrate this approach with our game simulating drug shortages in a supply chain context.

This analysis revealed a wide assortment of applications, and that most systems’ designs addressed only a small subset of principles among those we identified.

Here, we leverage data from Birdwatch, Twitter’s crowdsourced fact-checking pilot program, to directly measure judgments of whether other users’ tweets are misleading, and whether other users’ free-text evaluations of third-party tweets are helpful. For both sets of judgments, we find that contextual features – in particular, the partisanship of the users – are far more predictive of judgments than the content of the tweets and evaluations themselves. Specifically, users are more likely to write negative evaluations of tweets from counter-partisans; and are more likely to rate evaluations from counter-partisans as unhelpful. Our findings provide clear evidence that Birdwatch users preferentially challenge content from those with whom they disagree politically. While not necessarily indicating that Birdwatch is ineffective for identifying misleading content, these results demonstrate the important role that partisanship can play in content evaluation. Platform designers must consider the ramifications of partisanship when implementing crowdsourcing programs.},

We show that predicting mental wellbeing with passive data (offline sensors or online social media) is related to how the ground-truth is measured (objective arousal or self-report). Features with psycho-social signals (e.g., language) were better at predicting self-reported anxiety and stress. Conversely, features with behavioral signals (e.g., sleep), were better at predicting stressful arousal. Regardless of the source of ground truth, integrating both signals boosted prediction. To reduce the semantic gap, we provide recommendations to evaluate ground truth measures and adopt parsimonious sensing.},

Walking-in-place (WIP) locomotion solutions may provide a natural approach for VR use cases that require locomotion to share similar qualities with walking in real-life. However, there is limited knowledge on the range of experiences across common WIP methods to inform the design of usable WIP solutions using consumer-accessible components. This paper contributes to this knowledge via a user study with 40 participants that experienced several easy-to-setup WIP methods in a VR commuting simulation. A nuanced understanding of cybersickness and exertion relationships and walking affordances based on different tracker setups were among the findings derived from a corroborated analysis of think-aloud, interview, and observational data, supplemented with self-reports of VR sickness, presence and flow. Practical design insights were then constructed along the dimensions of cybersickness, affordances, space and user interfaces.},

Herein we propose ImpactVest to render spatio-temporal multilevel impact force feedback on body. By independently controlling nine impactors in a 3 \texttimes{} 3 layout using elastic force, impact is generated at different levels, positions and time sequences for versatile spatial and temporal combinations. We conducted a just-noticeable difference (JND) study to understand users’ impact level distinguishability on the body. A time interval threshold study was then performed to ascertain what time interval thresholds between two impact stimuli should be used to distinguish from simultaneous impact, a continuous impact stroke and two discrete impact stimuli. Based on the results, we conducted a VR experience study to verify that impact feedback from ImpactVest enhances VR realism.},

Based on these results, we created a system that automatically generates speech balloons matching linear emotional arousal intensity by Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Networks (ACGAN).

Next, we design a few-shot learning framework which derives a lightweight model from our pre-trained model, enabling knowledge transfer without performance degradation. We validate our approach through a user study (N=20) examining on-device customization from 12 new gestures, resulting in an average accuracy of 55.3%, 83.1%, and 87.2% on using one, three, or five shots when adding a new gesture, while maintaining the same recognition accuracy and false-positive rate from the pre-existing gesture set. We further evaluate the usability of our real-time implementation with a user experience study (N=20). Our results highlight the effectiveness, learnability, and usability of our customization framework.

Less exciting is the need for holding hand controllers, which limits applications that demand expressive, readily available interactions. Prior research investigated freehand AR/VR input by transforming the user’s body into an interaction medium. In contrast to previous work that has users’ hands grasp virtual objects, we propose a new interaction technique that lets users’ hands become virtual objects by imitating the objects themselves. For example, a thumbs-up hand pose is used to mimic a joystick. We created a wide array of interaction designs around this idea to demonstrate its applicability in object retrieval and interactive control tasks. Collectively, we call these interaction designs Hand Interfaces. From a series of user studies comparing Hand Interfaces against various baseline techniques, we collected quantitative and qualitative feedback, which indicates that Hand Interfaces are effective, expressive, and fun to use.},

Then, we consulted eight experts from the film industry to formulate 28 guidelines. To validate the usability and effectiveness of the guidelines, we asked participants to create data video openings with and without the guidelines, which were then evaluated by experts and the general public. Results showed that the openings designed with the guidelines were perceived to be more attractive, and the guidelines were praised for clarity and inspiration.},

Consequently, little is known about the tradeoffs of pursuing data-driven approaches for health chatbots. We examined multiple artificial intelligence (AI) approaches to enable micro-coaching dialogs in nutrition — brief coaching conversations related to specific meals, to support achievement of nutrition goals — and compared, reinforcement learning (RL), rule-based, and scripted approaches for dialog management. While the data-driven RL chatbot succeeded in shorter, more efficient dialogs, surprisingly the simplest, scripted chatbot was rated as higher quality, despite not fulfilling its task as consistently.

When a user is unavailable, e.g., focused on a task or in a call, our approach captures co-located or remote physical events in real-time, constructs a causality graph of co-dependent events, and lets immersed users revisit them at a suitable time in a causally accurate way. Enabled by our system AsyncReality, we present a workplace scenario that includes walk-in interruptions during a person’s focused work, physical deliveries, and transient spoken messages. We then generalize our approach to a use-case agnostic concept and system architecture. We conclude by discussing the implications of Asynchronous Reality for future offices.},

	abstract     = {Online medical crowdfunding campaigns (OMCCs) help patients seek financial support. First impressions (FIs) of an OMCC, including perceived empathy, credibility, justice, impact, and attractiveness, could affect viewers’ donation decisions. Images play a crucial role in manifesting FIs, and it is beneficial for fundraisers to understand how viewers may judge their selected images for OMCCs beforehand. This work proposes a data-driven approach to assessing whether an OMCC image conveys appropriate FIs. We first crowdsource viewers’ perception of OMCC images. Statistical analysis confirms that agreement on all five dimensions of FIs exists, and these FIs positively correlate with donation intention.

We investigate menstrual tracking and data-sharing attitudes and practices in educated, young (20-30 years old) menstruating individuals based in the United States, with self-identified minimal menstrual education backgrounds. Using interviews (N=18), a survey (N=62), and participatory design (N=7), we find that existing mechanisms for tracking and sharing data on menstruation are not adequately responsive to the needs of those who seek relevant menstrual education, are not in the sexual majority, and/or wish to customize what menstrual data they share and with whom. Our analysis highlights a design gap for participants with minimal sexual education backgrounds who wish to better understand their cycles. We also contribute a deepened understanding of structural health inequities that impact menstrual tracking and sharing practices, making recommendations for technology-mediated menstrual care.},

To express such variations of confusion matrices, we design an algebra that models confusion matrices as probability distributions. Based on this algebra, we develop Neo, a visual analytics system that enables practitioners to flexibly author and interact with hierarchical and multi-output confusion matrices, visualize derived metrics, renormalize confusions, and share matrix specifications. Finally, we demonstrate Neo’s utility with three model evaluation scenarios that help people better understand model performance and reveal hidden confusions.},

While prior work has studied gender roles in greeting card messages, systematic analysis at scale and tools for raising the awareness of gender stereotyping remain under-investigated. To this end, we collect a large greeting card message corpus covering three different occasions (birthday, Valentine’s Day and wedding) from three sources (exemplars from greeting message websites, real-life greetings from social media and language model generated ones). We uncover a wide range of gender stereotypes in this corpus via topic modeling, odds ratio and Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT). We further conduct a survey to understand people’s perception of gender roles in messages from this corpus and if gender stereotyping is a concern. The results show that people want to be aware of gender roles in the messages, but remain unconcerned unless the perceived gender roles conflict with the recipient’s true personality. In response, we developed GreetA, an interactive visualization and writing assistant tool to visualize fine-grained topics in greeting card messages drafted by the users and the associated gender perception scores, but without suggesting text changes as an intervention.},

Given the cultural and contextual aspects of accommodating bystanders, we identify a gap where bystanders in non-western societies have been insufficiently researched. To address this we conduct 20 interviews with domestic workers and household employers in Jordan, exploring privacy attitudes and practices. Our analysis uncovers a complex interplay between religious and social norms; legal and regulatory perspectives on privacy; and tensions between households and their domestic workers. We explore issues arising from smart homes coexisting as a residence and workplace, and highlight how workplace protections are ill-suited.

We found that workers perceive both platform companies and customers as sources of unnecessary and opaque data collection and surveillance that can threaten their privacy, safety, and economic outcomes. Workers also engage in many risk mitigation strategies, including self-protective surveillance behaviors such as video recording themselves and customers, as a costly but necessary response to power imbalances created by surveillance.

Through semi-structured interviews with children with T1D and their parents (N=41), our study showed that children’s knowledge of illness management and motivation for self-care were crucial for their transition towards independence. Based on these two factors, we identified four types of children’s collaboration (i.e., dependent, resistant, eager, and independent) and parents’ strategies for supporting their children’s independence.

Existing methods mainly focus on the visual appearance of visualizations by regarding them as bitmap images. However, the structural information intrinsically existing in SVG-based visualizations is ignored. Such structural information can delineate the spatial and hierarchical relationship among visual elements, and characterize visualizations thoroughly from a new perspective. This paper presents a structure-aware method to advance the performance of visualization retrieval by collectively considering both the visual and structural information.

We showed HybridTrak is more accurate than RGB or depth-based tracking methods on the MPI-INF-3DHP dataset.

However, the facilitator role has not yet been thoroughly debated in existing design discourse, and support for role-related reflections is limited. As the first steps towards an enriched collective understanding of this specific role and its realization, we interviewed 14 respondents with an academic background in participatory design and extensive facilitation experience. Based on a content analysis of the interviews, we identified six facets of the role: (1) trust builder, (2) enabler, (3) inquirer, (4) direction setter, (5) value provider, and (6) users’ advocate. Each facet is presented as consisting of the respondents’ perceived associated responsibilities and corresponding strategies. Our results paint a complex picture of participatory design facilitation. We propose the multi-faceted understanding of the facilitator role emerging from this work as a basis for problematized reflection on the role and its realization.},

We found that stress patterns, emotional states, and physical states are similar for both groups. Our autistic participants prioritized academic success over everything else, often intentionally confining their movements among academic, resident, and work locations to engage themselves with academic work as much as possible. They had a small number of friends, always preferring quality over quantity and sometimes regarding friends as close as family members. To maintain a better social life, they extensively used social media. They slept more than neurotypical participants per day; however, they experienced lower sleep quality.},

We investigated: 1) how viewers’ affect is linked to their behavioural change intentions; 2) how these affect are linked to the viewers’ personality traits; 3) which attributes of DVs are linked to their persuasive potential. Results from both studies indicated that viewers’ negative affect lowered their behavioural change intentions. Individuals with higher neuroticism exhibited higher negative affect and were harder to convince. Finally, Study 2 proved that providing any solutions to the health problem, presented in the DV, made the viewers perceive the videos as more actionable while lowering their negative affect, and importantly, induced higher behavioural change intentions.},

Users can modify IoT service mashups using CoMMA through natural language conversations. CoMMA has a two-step mashup modification interaction, an implicature-based localization step, and a modification step with a disambiguation strategy. The localization step allows users to easily search for a mashup by vocalizing their expressions in the environment. The modification step supports users to modify mashups by speaking simple modification commands. We conducted a user study and the results show that CoMMA is as effective as visual approaches in terms of task completion time and perceived task workload for modifying IoT service mashups.},

The Implicit Association Test (IAT) has been widely used to assess people’s associations of target concepts with qualitative attributes, such as the likelihood of being hired or convicted depending on race, gender, or age. The condensed version–the Brief IAT–aims to implicit biases by measuring the reaction time to concept classifications. To use this measure in HCI research, however, we need a way to construct and validate target concepts, which tend to quickly evolve and depend on geographical and cultural interpretations. In this paper, we introduce and evaluate a new method to appropriate the BIAT using crowdsourcing to measure people’s leanings on polarising topics. We present a web-based tool to test participants’ bias on custom themes, where self-assessments often fail. We validated our approach with 14 domain experts and assessed the fit of crowdsourced test construction. Our method allows researchers of different domains to create and validate bias tests that can be geographically tailored and updated over time. We discuss how our method can be applied to surface implicit user biases and run studies where cognitive biases may impede reliable results.},

However, current mannequins have no dynamic facial expressions, which decreases the mannequins’ fidelity and impacts students’ learning outcomes and experience. This study proposes a projection-based AR system for overlaying dynamic facial expressions on a mannequin and implements the system in a stroke simulation. Thirty-six undergraduate nursing students participated in the study and were equally divided into the control (without the system) and experimental group (with the system). The participants’ gaze behavior, simulation performance, and subjective evaluation were measured. Results illustrated that the participants focused more on the face-animated mannequin than the traditional mannequin during the simulation. Nursing experts believed that the face-animated mannequin increased the participants’ performance in recognizing deviations but decreased their performance in seeking additional information. Moreover, the participants reported that the face-animated mannequin was more interactive and helpful for performing appropriate assessments than the traditional mannequin.},

Besides revealing important facts, our findings highlight the need of decentering the design from the victims (children and/or guardians) to the community. Hence, building on the theory of transformative justice, we prototyped and evaluated ‘ShishuShurokkha’ – an online tool that involves the whole community by allowing anonymous bystander reporting, visualizing case-maps, connecting with legal, medical, and social support, and raising awareness. The evaluation of ShishuShurokkha shows the promise for such a communal approach toward combating child sexual abuse, and highlights the needs for sincere involvement of the government, NGOs, the legal, educational, and religious services in this.},

Overall, the tendency of players to make moves similar to those recommended by AI has sharply increased since 2017. The degree to which players’ expected win rates fluctuate during a game has also decreased significantly since 2017.

We evaluated four clutching techniques with 34 health professionals, measuring interaction performance and interviewing them to obtain insight into their views on clutching, and touchless control of medical imaging. As well as exploring the performance of the different clutching techniques, our analysis revealed an appetite for reliable touchless interfaces, a strong desire to reduce shared surface contact, and suggested potential improvements such as combined authentication and touchless control.

These proposals resulted from ideation workshops involving 12 professional designers, and were presented as scenario-based storyboards during interviews. Our interviews revealed three design approaches that appealed to parents. We describe seven benefits that parents imagined these approaches would have, and discuss ways in which they should be further explored. Thus, we contribute to a more complete understanding of how technology design might better support parents’ aspirations for how devices are used within the family.},

We present Cicero, a declarative grammar for concisely specifying responsive visualization transformations which paves the way for more intelligent responsive visualization authoring tools. Cicero’s flexible specifier syntax allows authors to select visualization elements to transform, independent of the source view’s structure. Cicero encodes a concise set of actions to encode a diverse set of transformations in both desktop-first and mobile-first design processes. Authors can ultimately reuse design-agnostic transformations across different visualizations. To demonstrate the utility of Cicero, we develop a compiler to an extended version of Vega-Lite, and provide principles for our compiler. We further discuss the incorporation of Cicero into responsive visualization authoring tools, such as a design recommender.},

Taking a researcher-introspective approach, two authors reflectively analyzed the processes and outcomes of the inquiry. The findings revealed that during the creative practice, the activity of seeing is a meaning-making process that is guided, shifted, and diffracted through visual conversations between visible and invisible qualities suggested by compositional rules and computer vision.

We collected gaze and typing behavior from 49 users while creating accounts for 1) a webmail client and 2) a news website. While most participants came up with a new password, 32% reported having reused an old password when setting up their accounts. We then compared different ML models to detect password reuse from the collected data. Our models achieve an accuracy of up to 87.7% in detecting password reuse from gaze, 75.8% accuracy from typing, and 88.75% when considering both types of behavior.

Given the increasing digital technology adoption amongst older adults, researchers have investigated how technology can support aging populations. However, little work has examined how technology can support older adults during crises, despite increasingly common natural disasters, public health emergencies, and other crisis scenarios in which older adults are especially vulnerable. Addressing this gap, we conducted focus groups with older adults residing in coastal locations to examine to what extent they felt technology could support them during emergencies. Our findings characterize participants’ desire for tools that enhance community resilience-local knowledge, preparedness, community relationships, and communication, that help communities withstand disasters. Further, older adults’ crisis technology preferences were linked to their sense of control, social relationships, and digital readiness. We discuss how a focus on community resilience can yield crisis technologies that more effectively support older adults.},

To meet this need, we study three renowned art-and-engineering practitioners (Kl\"{u}ver, Paik, Moog) and our own experimental project titled ‘The Electronicists’ in which participants from different disciplines collaborated to produce three hybrid works. Based on this work, we propose a framework of ‘techno-aesthetic encounters’ that pursues event-based creativity through the mediation of engineering, art, and humanistic engagements. We suggest trust-based experiments, error-engaged studio, and art-based ethnography as promising methodological tenets of this approach.},

To inform the system design, we developed five scenarios exploring the benefits that hand-held and head-worn AR can bring to STEM instruction and developed a design space of AR interactions enhancing paper based on these scenarios and prior work. Using the example of an AR physics handout, we assessed the system’s potential with PhD-level instructors and its usability with XR design experts.

We propose to normalize the speed-accuracy biases by applying the effective sizes to existing Fitts’ law formulations including width W and height H. We call this target-size adjustment the bivariate effective width method. We found that, overall, Accot and Zhai’s weighted Euclidean model using the effective width and height independently showed the best fit to the data in which the three instruction conditions were mixed (i.e., the time data measured in all instructions were analyzed with a single regression expression).

Finally, we mapped the design categories and associated design heuristics to core components of popular open science platforms.

We identify three key challenges—overcoming habits, learning new forms of movement, transitioning over time—and their strategies for addressing them. We argue that successful tools must help dancers change their mentality about new movement styles, rather than focusing solely on movement mechanics. We suggest three possible implications for design: develop “movement substrates” that handle multiple movement representations; integrate learning and reflection in a single session; and create movement definitions through movement.

Since most smartphones have a front camera, this method can be used regardless of the device model; in addition, no additional sensor or hardware is required.

In partnership with a timebank and a federally qualified healthcare center (FQHC), 30 participants completed activity packets and 29 of them attended online workshop sessions. Our findings suggest that promoting trust between drivers and riders requires systems that prioritize safety and reliability; yet, there were discrepancies in the ability of the timebank and FQHC to moderate trust. We also found that timebank supports reciprocity, but healthcare transportation requires additional support to ensure balanced reciprocity. We explain these findings drawing from network closure and trust literature. Finally, we contribute design implications for systems that promote trust and facilitate relational over transactional interactions, which help to promote reciprocity and reflect participants’ values.},

Across two online experiments, we measure the effectiveness of using nutritional information nudges with added in-group (people like you) and out-group (people not like you) social comparisons. Our preliminary findings suggest that out-group social comparison nudges can be effective in encouraging both normal weight and overweight adults to reduce calories, even when these adults indicate that they do not typically change their diet behaviors.

Based on a seven-month-long qualitative empirical study in Dhaka, this paper reports how Facebook commerce (F-commerce) drives many local women to actively engage in home-based businesses, which in turn, challenges the inherent spatial regulations of modern residential architecture. This paper also documents how F-commerce mediated transformations in residential spaces are promoting heterogeneous functions, re-surfacing traditional values, and altering orders and rationales that define modern housing. Drawing from a rich body of literature in urban housing architecture, critical theories around modernism, South-Asian feminism, and postcolonial computing, we explain how these spatial transformations and alterations are “appropriating” architectural design vocabularies. Our findings further explain how negligence toward such emerging needs often marginalizes the women spatially and economically, who are involved in F-commerce. We conclude with design implications to architecture and HCI to address these issues, and connect our findings to the broader agendas of Postcolonial HCI around diversity, inclusion, and global development.},

Passages directly supports the above-listed activities as well as fluid transitions among them. Two user studies show that participants found Passages both elegant and powerful, facilitating their work practices and enabling greater reuse and novel strategies for analyzing and composing documents.

As an initial step, this paper presents research in developing the backchanneling ability in CAs in the form of a verbal response to engage the speaker. We analyzed 246 conversations of cognitive assessments between older adults and human assessors, and derived the categories of reactive backchannels (e.g. “hmm”) and proactive backchannels (e.g. “please keep going”). This is used in the development of TalkTive, a CA which can predict both timing and form of backchanneling during cognitive assessments. The study then invited 36 older adult participants to evaluate the backchanneling feature. Results show that proactive backchanneling is more appreciated by participants than reactive backchanneling.},

We present InfraredTags, which are 2D markers and barcodes imperceptible to the naked eye that can be 3D printed as part of objects, and detected rapidly by low-cost near-infrared cameras. We achieve this by printing objects from an infrared-transmitting filament, which infrared cameras can see through, and by having air gaps inside for the tag’s bits, which appear at a different intensity in the infrared image. We built a user interface that facilitates the integration of common tags (QR codes, ArUco markers) with the object geometry to make them 3D printable as InfraredTags. We also developed a low-cost infrared imaging module that augments existing mobile devices and decodes tags using our image processing pipeline. Our evaluation shows that the tags can be detected with little near-infrared illumination (0.2lux) and from distances as far as 250cm. We demonstrate how our method enables various applications, such as object tracking and embedding metadata for augmented reality and tangible interactions.},

However, these ideals often remove women's control over their bodies overlooking how the bodily experiences of pregnancy are socially and culturally constructed. We report on 27 interviews with pregnant women and nursing mothers in rural and semi-urban areas of South India, and six focus groups with 23 frontline health workers as secondary data. We explore how the embodied pregnancy experiences are influenced and negotiated by the socio-cultural context and existing care infrastructures. Our findings highlight how the ways of seeing, knowing, and caring for a body of a pregnant woman through often conflicting norms, beliefs and practices of medicine, nourishment and care actively shape the experiences of pregnancy. We open up a space for novel opportunities for digital health technologies to enhance women's embodied experiences and pregnancy care infrastructures in the Global South.},

Finger identification, or assigning different functionality to different fingers, has been frequently proposed. However, while the value of the technique seems clear, its implementation remains challenging, often relying on external devices (e.g., worn magnets) or explicit instructions. Addressing these limitations, this paper explores a novel approach to natural and unencumbered finger identification on an unmodified smartwatch: sonar. To do this, we adapt an existing finger tracking smartphone sonar implementation—rather than extract finger motion, we process raw sonar fingerprints representing the complete sonar scene recorded during a touch. We capture data from 16 participants operating a smartwatch and use their sonar fingerprints to train a deep learning recognizer that identifies taps by the thumb, index, and middle fingers with an accuracy of up to 93.7%, sufficient to support meaningful application development.},

Specifically, we report on how youth in a six-week design internship used unmaking as a design move to subvert conventional narratives about their surrounding urban context. We analyze how this led to conflictual encounters at the local senior center, and compare it to the other, making-centric proposals which received favorable feedback but failed to raise the same important discussions. Through this ethnographic account, we argue that critical unmaking is important yet overlooked, and should be in the repertoire of design moves available for agonism and provocation.},

We identified the remote co-teaching classes’ standard practices and co-teachers’ collaborative work process. We also found that remote teachers’ high-quality class directly impacted local teachers and students. Furthermore, interestingly, local teachers were also actively involved in making indirect impacts on their students by deeply coordinating with remote teachers and adapting the resources offered by the remote teachers.

Third, we demonstrated how it enables interactions not possible before by building a range of applications, such as (1) synchronizing head orientations of two users, which enables a user to communicate head nods to another user while listening to music, and (2) directly changing the user's head orientation to locate objects in AR. Finally, in our second study, participants felt that our head actuation contributed positively to their experience in four distinct applications.},

Nine in-depth interviews with eHealth coaches were conducted. The data were analyzed using thematic analysis, deriving three themes: ‘Understanding the client,’ ‘Adapting Support,’ and ‘Navigating challenges.’ Coaches used both assessment tools and their growing relationship to understand client's needs. Coaches adapted the pace and nature of educational content, utilized their clients' preferred technologies, and adopted different personas to meet the needs of each individual. Providing tailored support also presented challenges for eHealth coaches, with technology eroding personal and professional boundaries. Our work interrogates what it means to ‘tailor’ support, through exploring coaching as a humanistic approach to behaviour change, with implications for the design of person-centered digital coaching interventions/systems.},

Results showed significant effects: increasing Intensity caused higher ratings of urgency, annoyance and arousal but reduced valence. We established clear levels for differentiating each sensation. A second study then investigated Intensity and Pulse Frequency to find out how many distinguishable levels could be perceived. Results showed that both Intensity and Pulse Frequency significantly affected perception, with four distinguishable levels of Intensity and two of Pulse Frequency.

However, our system utilizes a controller-based interaction system to enable diverse users to interactively create articulated plasterwork in-situ. A customizable computational toolset converts human intentions into robotic motions while respecting robotic and material constraints. To accomplish this, we developed both an interactive computational model to translate the data from a motion-tracking system into robotic trajectories using design and editing tools as well as an audio-visual guidance system for in-situ projection. We then conducted two user-studies of designers and skilled workers who used IRoP to design and fabricate a full-scale demonstrator.},

But these TAs are often relative beginners themselves, both in programming and in teaching. In this paper, we examine the impact of availability of corrected code on TAs’ ability to find, fix, and address bugs in student code. We found that seeing a corrected version of the student code helps TAs debug code 29% faster, and write more accurate and complete student-facing explanations of the bugs (30% more likely to correctly address a given bug). We also observed that TAs do not generally struggle with the conceptual understanding of the underlying material. Rather, their difficulties seem more related to issues with working memory, attention, and overall high cognitive load.},

In virtual worlds, players can adopt empowering roles to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and/or adapt to climate impacts. However, the lack of a comprehensive exploration of existing climate-related identities and actions prevents understanding their potential. Here, we analyze 80 video games and classify avatar identities, or expected player roles, into six types. Climate selves encourage direct life changes; climate citizens are easy to identify with and imitate; climate heroes are inspirational figures upholding environmental values; empowered individuals deliberate to avoid a tragedy of the commons; authorities should consider stakeholders and the environment; and faction leaders engage in bi- or multilateral relations. Adaptation is often for decision-making profiles, while empowered individuals, authorities, and faction leaders usually face conflicting objectives. We discuss our results in relation to avatar research and provide suggestions for researchers, designers, and educators.},

Over a six-week field evaluation of LivingMoments, involving six participants living at home with different levels of dementia, we collected qualitative and quantitative data about the experiences of them and their relatives. Based on the data analysis, we found the need to adapt communication to individual abilities, lowering barriers through content calibration and establishing habits for continuous use.

Our solution utilizes a NIR front-facing camera for facial recognition paired with the RGB selfie camera to perform tracking of absolute pupil dilation with sub-millimeter accuracy. In comparison to a gold standard pupillometer during a pupillary light reflex test, the smartphone-based system achieves a median MAE of 0.27mm for absolute pupil dilation tracking and a median error of 3.52% for pupil dilation change tracking. Additionally, we remotely deployed the system to older adults as part of a usability study that demonstrates promise for future smartphone deployments to remotely collect data in older, inexperienced adult users operating the system themselves.},

We found that more control dimensions (sliders) significantly increase task difficulty and user actions. Visual feedforward partly mitigates this by enabling more goal-directed interaction. However, we found no evidence of faster or more accurate task performance. This indicates a tradeoff between feedforward detail and implied cognitive costs, such as attention. Moreover, we found that visualizations alone are not always sufficient for users to understand individual control dimensions. Our study quantifies fundamental UI design factors and resulting interaction behavior in this context, revealing opportunities for improvement in the UI design for interactive applications of generative models.

	abstract     = {Fitness tracking applications allow athletes to record and share their exercises online, including GPS routes of their activities. However, sharing mobility data potentially raises real-world privacy and safety risks. One strategy to mitigate that risk is a “Privacy Zone,” which conceals portions of the exercise routes that fall within a certain radius of a user-designated sensitive location. A pressing concern is whether privacy zones are an effective deterrent against common attackers, such as a bike thief that carefully scrutinizes online exercise activities in search of their next target. Further, little is known about user perceptions of privacy zones or how they fit into the broader landscape of available privacy precautions. This work presents an online user study (N=603) that investigates the privacy concerns of fitness tracking users and evaluates the efficacy of privacy zones. Participants were first asked about their privacy behaviors with respect to fitness tracking applications. Next, participants completed an interactive task in which they attempted to deduce hidden locations protected by a privacy zone; we manipulated the number of displayed exercise activities that interacted with the privacy zone, as well as its size. Finally, participants were asked further questions about their impressions of privacy zones and use of other privacy precautions. We found that participants successfully inferred protected locations; for the most common privacy zone size, 68% of guesses fell within 50 meters of the hidden location when participants were shown just 3 activities. Further, we found that participants who viewed 3 activities were more confident about their success in the task compared to participants who viewed 1 activity. Combined, these results indicate that users’ privacy-sensitive locations are at risk even when using a privacy zone. We conclude by considering the implications of our findings on related privacy features and discuss recommendations to fitness tracking users and services to improve the privacy and safety of fitness trackers.},

Leveraging this idea, we designed a circular progress bar to provide progress updates in paracentral and near-peripheral vision. We compared it with textual and linear progress bars under two conversation settings: a simulated one with a digital conversation partner and a realistic one with a real partner. Results show that a circular progress bar can effectively reduce notification distractions without losing eye contact and is more preferred by users.

This paper presents Meander Coil++, enabling safe, energy-efficient, and body-scale wireless power delivery. Meander Coil++ uses a wiring pattern that suppresses electromagnetic exposure to the human body without compromising power delivery performance and a liquid-metal-based low-loss conductive cord. With these advancements, Meander Coil++ transmits a few watts of power to on-body devices at 25% DC-to-DC efficiency while complying with international safety guidelines regarding electromagnetic exposure.

While it has experienced a surge in popularity internationally, people with visual impairments cannot enjoy webtoon with the lack of an accessible format. While traditional image description practices can be adopted, resulting descriptions cannot preserve webtoons’ unique values such as control over the reading pace and social engagement through comments. To improve the webtoon reading experience for BLV users, we propose Cocomix, an interactive webtoon reader that leverages comments into the design of novel webtoon interactions. Since comments can identify story highlights and provide additional context, we designed a system that provides 1) comments-based adaptive descriptions with selective access to details and 2) panel-anchored comments for easy access to relevant descriptive comments. Our evaluation (N=12) showed that Cocomix users could adapt the description for various needs and better utilize comments.},

However, the recent emergence of pervasive data about the sport and the growth of new forms of sports analytics is changing writers’ jobs. While these writers seek to leverage the data and analytics to create engaging, data-driven stories, they typically lack the technical background to perform analytics or efficiently explore data. We investigated and analyzed the work and context of basketball writers, interviewed nine stakeholders to understand the challenges from a holistic view. Based on what we learned, we designed and constructed two interactive visualization systems that support rapid and in-depth sports data exploration and sense-making to enhance their articles and reporting. We deployed the systems during the recent NBA playoffs to gather initial feedback. This article describes the visualization design study we conducted, the resulting visualization systems, and what we learned to potentially help basketball writers in the future.},

	abstract     = {Multimodal Interfaces (MMIs) combining speech and spatial input have the potential to elicit minimal cognitive load. Low cognitive load increases effectiveness as well as user satisfaction and is regarded as an important aspect of intuitive use. While this potential has been extensively theorized in the research community, experiments that provide supporting observations based on functional interfaces are still scarce. In particular, there is a lack of studies comparing the commonly used Unimodal Interfaces (UMIs) with theoretically superior synergistic MMI alternatives. Yet, these studies are an essential prerequisite for generalizing results, developing practice-oriented guidelines, and ultimately exploiting the potential of MMIs in a broader range of applications. This work contributes a novel observation towards the resolution of this shortcoming in the context of the following combination of applied interaction techniques, tasks, application domain, and technology: We present a comprehensive evaluation of a synergistic speech &amp; touch MMI and a touch-only menu-based UMI (interaction techniques) for selection and system control tasks in a digital tabletop game (application domain) on an interactive surface (technology). Cognitive load, user experience, and intuitive use are evaluated, with the former being assessed by means of the dual-task paradigm. Our experiment shows that the implemented MMI causes significantly less cognitive load and is perceived significantly more usable and intuitive than the UMI. Based on our results, we derive recommendations for the interface design of digital tabletop games on interactive surfaces. Further, we argue that our results and design recommendations are suitable to be generalized to other application domains on interactive surfaces for selection and system control tasks.},

Eyeglasses are emerging as a socially-acceptable eating detection wearable, but existing approaches require custom-built frames and consume large power. We propose MyDJ, an eating detection system that could be attached to any eyeglass frame. MyDJ achieves accurate and energy-efficient eating detection by capturing complementary chewing signals on a piezoelectric sensor and an accelerometer. We evaluated the accuracy and wearability of MyDJ with 30 subjects in uncontrolled environments, where six subjects attached MyDJ on their own eyeglasses for a week. Our study shows that MyDJ achieves 0.919 F1-score in eating episode coverage, with 4.03 \texttimes{} battery time over the state-of-the-art systems. In addition, participants reported wearing MyDJ was almost as comfortable (94.95%) as wearing regular eyeglasses.},

Through a series of formative, perceptual, and user experience studies with a combined total of 72 unique participants, we explored several perceptual designs using force magnitude scaling and duration scaling methods to expand the dynamic range of perceived force magnitude.

We report on two studies on touch-affect associations, using the crossmodal “Bouba-Kiki” paradigm, to understand affective responses to shape-change as it unfolds. We investigate experiences with a shape-change gadget, as it moves between rounded (“Bouba”) and spiky (“Kiki”) forms. We capture affective responses via the circumplex model, and use a motion analysis approach to understand the certainty of these responses. We find that touch-affect associations are influenced by both the size and the frequency of the shape-change and may be modality-dependent, and that certainty in affective associations is influenced by association-consistency.},

We built mixed-effects models to examine the effect of the note-taking modality on learners’ text comprehension, the content of notes and their meta-comprehension judgement. Our findings suggest that taking notes using voice leads to a higher conceptual understanding of the text when compared to typing the notes. We also found that using voice triggers generative processes that result in learners taking more elaborate and comprehensive notes.

The narration behavior of screen readers for such out-of-vocabulary words and the corresponding impact on the social media experience of blind screen reader users are still uncharted research territories. Therefore we seek to plug this knowledge gap by examining how current popular screen readers narrate different types of out-of-vocabulary words found on Twitter, and also, how the presence of such words in tweets influences the interaction behavior and comprehension of blind screen reader users. Our investigation showed that screen readers rarely autocorrect out-of-vocabulary words, and moreover they do not always exhibit ideal behavior for certain prolific types of out-of-vocabulary words such as acronyms and initialisms. We also observed that blind users often rely on tedious and taxing workarounds to comprehend actual meanings of out-of-vocabulary words. Informed by the observations, we finally discuss methods that can potentially reduce this interaction burden for blind users on social media.},

	abstract     = {Mentorship and other social and relational support have been vital to poverty alleviation and transformative change. It is crucial to understand the underlying factors in the success of mentoring models and subsequent programs to support them. Thus, we conducted a mixed-methods study consisting of longitudinal surveys of community participants followed by semi-structured interviews with 28 community members, eight mentors, and two coaches participating in a community-based mentorship program. Drawing from community-based participatory research in partnership with a non-profit located in a Midwestern United States (U.S.) city, we unpack how the program supported self-sufficiency and economic mobility among adults experiencing financial hardships. Through an infrastructural lens, we attend to individuals’ infrastructuring work in social support, flexibility, and trust to support a “village” model of community-based mentorship. Our results show how the village model differs from traditional mentorship models that assume dyadic, one-to-one, often didactic, and hierarchical relationships (e.g., expert and prot\'{e}g\'{e}, adult and child) and are used primarily in the workplace and educational settings. The village mentorship model advocates for less hierarchical and more balanced relationships in non-institutional settings and flexible communication and technological needs. We discuss new research opportunities and design strategies for rethinking technology-mediated mentorship to support poverty-stricken adults in the U.S.},

There is a rich methodology literature on metrics and analysis methods that helps researchers understand and characterize data arising from such studies. However, deriving concrete gesture vocabularies from this data, which is often the ultimate goal, remains largely based on heuristics and ad hoc methods. In this paper, we treat the problem of deriving a gesture vocabulary from gesture elicitation data as a computational optimization problem. We show how to formalize it as an optimal assignment problem and discuss how to express objective functions and custom design constraints through integer programs. In addition, we introduce a set of tools for assessing the uncertainty of optimization outcomes due to random sampling, and for supporting researchers’ decisions on when to stop collecting data from a gesture elicitation study. We evaluate our methods on a large number of simulated studies.},

Does their faith in one type or another depend on the quality of the recommendation, rather than how the recommendation appears to have been derived? We conducted an empirical study with a prototype of a movie recommender system to find out. A 3 (Ostensible Recommender Type: Content vs. Collaborative vs. Demographic Filtering) x 2 (Recommendation Quality: Good vs. Bad) experiment (N=226) investigated how users evaluate systems and attribute responsibility for the recommendations they receive. We found that users trust systems that use collaborative filtering more, regardless of the system's performance.

While existing mechanisms work well for simple software, they scale poorly to large feature-rich applications. In this paper, we explore new techniques to support trial-and-error in complex applications. We identify key benefits and challenges of trial-and-error, and introduce a framework with a conceptual model and design space. Using this framework, we developed three techniques: ToolTrack to keep track of trial-and-error progress; ToolTrip to go beyond trial-and-error of single commands by highlighting related commands that are frequently used together; and ToolTaste to quickly and safely try commands. We demonstrate how these techniques facilitate trial-and-error, as illustrated through a proof-of-concept implementation in the CAD software Fusion&nbsp;360. We conclude by discussing possible scenarios and outline directions for future research on trial-and-error.},

We propose a system that helps users create stylized casual 3D animations. A layered authoring interface is employed to balance between ease of use and expressiveness. Our surface level UI is a timeline sequencer that lets users add preset stylization effects such as squash and stretch and follow through to plain motions. Users can adjust spatial and temporal parameters to fine-tune these stylizations. These edits are propagated to our node-graph-based second level UI, in which the users can create custom stylizations after they are comfortable with the surface level UI. Our system also enables the stylization of interactions among multiple objects like force, energy, and collision. A pilot user study has shown that our fluid layered UI design allows for both ease of use and expressiveness better than existing tools.},

To address these issues, we developed Depth-Adaptive Cursor&nbsp;, a 2D-mouse driven pointing technique for 3D selection with depth-adaptation that continuously interpolates the cursor depth by inferring what users intend to select based on the cursor position, the viewpoint, and the selectable objects. Depth-Adaptive Cursor&nbsp;uses a novel CD gain tool to compute a usable range of CD gains for general mouse-based pointing in VR.

We find that many users simultaneously use both a browser-based and a third-party manager, using each as a backup for the other, with this new paradigm having intriguing usability and security implications. Users also eschew generated passwords because these passwords are challenging to enter and remember when the manager is unavailable, necessitating new generators that create easy-to-enter and remember passwords. Additionally, the credential audits provided by most managers overwhelm users, limiting their utility and indicating a need for more proactive and streamlined notification systems.

	abstract     = {Online learners are hugely diverse with varying prior knowledge, but most instructional videos online are created to be one-size-fits-all. Thus, learners may struggle to understand the content by only watching the videos. Providing scaffolding prompts can help learners overcome these struggles through questions and hints that relate different concepts in the videos and elicit meaningful learning. However, serving diverse learners would require a spectrum of scaffolding prompts, which incurs high authoring effort. In this work, we introduce Promptiverse, an approach for generating diverse, multi-turn scaffolding prompts at scale, powered by numerous traversal paths over knowledge graphs. To facilitate the construction of the knowledge graphs, we propose a hybrid human-AI annotation tool, Grannotate. In our study (N=24), participants produced 40 times more on-par quality prompts with higher diversity, through Promptiverse and Grannotate, compared to hand-designed prompts. Promptiverse presents a model for creating diverse and adaptive learning experiences online.},

However, UI layouts in existing datasets are often noisy, have mismatches with their visual representation, or consists of generic or app-specific types that are difficult to analyze and model. In this paper, we propose the CLAY pipeline that uses a deep learning approach for denoising UI layouts, allowing us to automatically improve existing mobile UI layout datasets at scale. Our pipeline takes both the screenshot and the raw UI layout, and annotates the raw layout by removing incorrect nodes and assigning a semantically meaningful type to each node. To experiment with our data-cleaning pipeline, we create the CLAY dataset of 59,555 human-annotated screen layouts, based on screenshots and raw layouts from Rico, a public mobile UI corpus. Our deep models achieve high accuracy with F1 scores of 82.7% for detecting layout objects that do not have a valid visual representation and 85.9% for recognizing object types, which significantly outperforms a heuristic baseline. Our work lays a foundation for creating large-scale high quality UI layout datasets for data-driven mobile UI research and reduces the need of manual labeling efforts that are prohibitively expensive.},

Through a review of 38 research papers, this work maps trends, themes, and methods of empirical research on children and CAs in HCI research over the last decade. A thematic analysis of the research found that work in this domain focuses on seven key topics: ascribing human-like qualities to CAs, CAs? support of children?s learning, the use and role of CAs in the home and family context, CAs? support of children?s play, children?s storytelling with CA, issues concerning the collection of information revealed by CAs, and CAs designed for children with differing abilities. Based on our findings, we identify the needs to account for children’s intersectional identities and linguistic and cultural diversity and theories from multiple disciples in the design of CAs, develop heuristics for child-centric interaction with CAs, to investigate implications of CAs on social cognition and interpersonal relationships, and to examine and design for multi-party interactions with CAs for different domains and contexts.},

Prior work has shown that children's interaction behaviors and expectations of technological devices can be quite different from adults’. It is important to understand children's mental models of AR headsets to design more effective experiences for them. To elicit children's perceptions, we conducted four participatory design sessions with ten children on designing content for imaginary AR headsets. We found that children expect AR systems to be highly intelligent and to recognize and virtually transform surroundings to create immersive environments. Also, children are in favor of using these devices for difficult tasks but prefer to work on their own for easy tasks. Our work contributes new understanding on how children comprehend AR headsets and provides recommendations for designing future headsets for children.},

In this design study, we analyse post-hoc how each of the seven projects employed aspects of counterfunctional design to achieve these aims.

Through interviews accompanying these requests and discussions scrutinising returned data, it appears that GDPR falls short of its goals due to non-compliance and low-quality responses. Participants found their hopes to understand providers’ data practices or harness their own data unmet. This causes increased distrust without any subjective improvement in power, although more transparent providers do earn greater trust.

We construct this design space through a systematic review of 47 physicalizations and analyze the interrelationships of key factors when designing a physicalization. This design space cross-pollinates knowledge from relevant HCI communities, providing a cohesive overview of what designers should consider when creating a data physicalization while suggesting new design possibilities. We analyze the design decisions present in current physicalizations, discuss emerging trends, and identify underlying open challenges.},

Workers generate designs to address these issues while considering competing interests of the platforms, customers, and themselves, such as information translucency, incentives co-configured by workers and platforms, worker-centered data-driven insights for well-being, and collective driver data sharing.

Collective action may empower groups of people affected by a PVEI to jointly demand redress, but a necessary first step is for the collective to agree on demands. We designed a sensitizing prototype to explore how to shepherd a collective to generate a unified set of demands for redress in response to a triggering PVEI. We found that collectives can converge on high-priority concerns and demands for redress, and that many of their demands indicated preferences for broad reform. We then gathered a panel of security and privacy experts to react to the collective’s demands. Experts were dismissive, preferring incremental measures that cleanly mapped onto existing legal structures. We argue this misalignment may help uphold the power chasm between data-harvesting institutions and the individuals whose personal data they monetize.},

Overall, we observe how workers’ reliance upon the ADS is guided by (1) their knowledge of rich, contextual information beyond what the AI model captures, (2) their beliefs about the ADS’s capabilities and limitations relative to their own, (3) organizational pressures and incentives around the use of the ADS, and (4) awareness of misalignments between algorithmic predictions and their own decision-making objectives.

CAs for polyadic interactions are unique because they encompass hybrid social interactions, i.e., human-CA, human-to-human, and human-to-group behaviors. However, research on polyadic CAs is scattered across different fields, making it challenging to identify, compare, and accumulate existing knowledge. To promote the future design of CA systems, we conducted a literature review of ACM publications and identified a set of works that conducted UX (user experience) research. We qualitatively synthesized the effects of polyadic CAs into four aspects of human-human interactions, i.e., communication, engagement, connection, and relationship maintenance. Through a mixed-method analysis of the selected polyadic and dyadic CA studies, we developed a suite of evaluation measurements on the effects. Our findings show that designing with social boundaries, such as privacy, disclosure, and identification, is crucial for ethical polyadic CAs. Future research should also advance usability testing methods and trust-building guidelines for conversational AI.},

Row-column scanning provides a method for choosing items arranged in a grid using a single switch. An alternative, Nomon, allows potential selections to be arranged arbitrarily rather than requiring a grid (as desired for gaming, drawing, etc.) — and provides an alternative probabilistic selection method. While past results suggest that Nomon may be faster and easier to use than row-column scanning, no work has yet quantified performance of the two methods over longer time periods or in tasks beyond writing. In this paper, we also develop and validate a webcam-based switch that allows a user without a motor impairment to approximate the response times of a motor-impaired single switch user; although the approximation is not a replacement for testing with single-switch users, it allows us to better initialize, calibrate, and evaluate our method. Over 10 sessions with the webcam switch, we found users typed faster and more easily with Nomon than with row-column scanning. The benefits of Nomon were even more pronounced in a picture-selection task. Evaluation and feedback from a motor-impaired switch user further supports the promise of Nomon.},

Both teachers and students must develop spatial competencies to effectively use classroom spaces, enabling fluid verbal and non-verbal interaction. While video permits rich activity capture, it provides no support for quickly seeing activity patterns that can assist learning. In contrast, position tracking systems permit the automated modelling of spatial behaviour, opening new possibilities for feedback. This paper introduces the design rationale for ”Dandelion Diagrams” that integrate participant location, trajectory and body orientation over a variable period. Applied in two authentic teaching contexts (a science laboratory, and a nursing simulation) we show how heatmaps showing only teacher/student location led to misinterpretations that were resolved by overlaying Dandelion Diagrams. Teachers also identified a variety of ways they could aid professional development. We conclude Dandelion Diagrams assisted sensemaking, but discuss the ethical risks of over-interpretation.},

This is achieved using a mechanism with spinning and pivoting disks that apply a tangential skin-slip movement to the fingertips. With SpinOcchio, we determined the baseline haptic discrimination threshold for skin-slip, and, using these results, we tested how haptic realism of motion and thickness is perceived with varying visual cues in VR. Surprisingly, the results show that in all cases, visual cues dominate over haptic perception. Based on these results, we suggest applications that leverage skin-slip and grip interaction, contributing further to realistic experiences in VR.},

These measurements are used to derive the user’s face orientation and distance with respect to the device. We conduct a ground truth comparison and user study to evaluate FaceOri’s performance. The results show that the system can determine whether the user orients to the device at a 93.5% accuracy within a 1.5 meters range. Furthermore, FaceOri can continuously track user’s head orientation with a median absolute error of 10.9 mm in the distance, 3.7° in yaw, and 5.8° in pitch.

Three sets of experiments involving sixty-six participants were conducted to investigate the effects of (i) visual complexity of eye design, (ii) blink rate, and (iii) gaze aversion of social robots on users’ perceived trustworthiness. Results indicate that high visual complexity and gaze aversion lead to higher perceived trustworthiness and reveal a positive correlation between the perceived anthropomorphic effect of eye design and users’ perceived trust, while a non-significant effect of blink rate has been found.

	abstract     = {Image-based sexual abuse (IBSA) is a severe social problem that causes survivors tremendous pain. IBSA survivors may encounter a lack of information and victim blame when seeking online and offline assistance. While institutions support survivors, they cannot be available 24 hours a day. Because the immediate reaction to IBSA is crucial to remove intimate images and prevent further distribution, survivors need first responders who are always accessible and do not blame them. Chatbots are constantly available, do not judge the conversation partner, and may deliver structured information and words of comfort. Therefore, we developed a chatbot to provide information and emotional support to IBSA survivors in dealing with their abuse. We analyzed nine chatbots for sexual violence survivors to identify common design elements. In addition, we sought advice from five professional counselors about the challenges survivors have while responding to their harm. We conducted a user study with 25 participants to determine the chatbot’s effectiveness in providing information and emotional support compared to internet search. The chatbot was better than the internet search regarding information organization, accessibility, and conciseness. Furthermore, the chatbot excels in providing emotional support to survivors. We discuss the survivor-centered information structure and design consideration of emotionally supportive conversation.},

We also characterized the types of privacy concerns users wanted to address through SH-PPBs, the reasons preventing users from doing SH-PPBs, and privacy features they wished they had to support SH-PPBs. We then storyboarded 11 privacy protection concepts to explore opportunities to better support users’ needs, and asked another 227 participants to criticize and rank these design concepts. Among the 11 concepts, Privacy Diagnostics, which is similar to security diagnostics in anti-virus software, was far preferred over the rest.

We created 18 SFX, studied their impact on perceived valence and arousal (N = 49) and selected four suitable SFX to be used in a between-participants user study (N = 317). Our findings show that neither task performance, affect, immersion, nor enjoyment were significantly affected by the sounds. Only the pressure/tension factor differed significantly, indicating that low valence sounds should be avoided to accompany point rewards. Overall, our results suggest that SFX seem to have less impact than expected in gamified systems.

In this study, we interviewed 24 childhood cancer survivors and six caregivers about their cancer survivorship experiences. The results of our analysis indicate that the challenges of transitioning to adulthood as a cancer survivor necessitate the development and management of multiple societal, relational, and personal boundaries, processes that social computing technologies can help or hinder.

In this paper, we first ran a bodystorming design workshop to capture the limitations of existing manual UI transition approaches in spatially diverse tasks. Then we addressed these limitations by designing and evaluating three UI transition mechanisms with different levels of automation and controllability (low-effort manual, semi-automated, fully-automated). Furthermore, we simulated imperfect contextual awareness by introducing prediction errors with different costs to correct them. Our results provide valuable lessons about the trade-offs between UI automation levels, controllability, user agency, and the impact of prediction errors.},

In a user study, participants evaluated the understandability of explanations for different framing and labeling conditions for loan applications and music recommendations.

However, the overall process remains challenging- from capturing design requirements and motion planning to authoring them to creating 3D models of mechanical parts to programming electronics, as it demands expertise. We introduce Mobiot, an end-user toolkit to help non-experts capture the design and motion requirements of legacy objects by demonstration. It then automatically generates 3D printable attachments, programs to operate assembled modules, a list of off-the-shelf electronics, and assembly tutorials. The authoring feature further assists users to fine-tune as well as to reuse existing motion libraries and 3D printed mechanisms to adapt to other real-world objects with different motions. We validate Mobiot through application examples with 8 everyday objects with various motions applied, and through technical evaluation to measure the accuracy of motion reconstruction.},

In this paper, we simulate human imprecision in conversational IVAs’ temporal statements. We conducted a survey to identify temporal statement patterns, transferred them to a conversational IVA, and conducted a user study evaluating the effects of time precision on perceived anthropomorphism and usefulness. Statistical analyses reveal significant interaction between time precision and agents’ use of memory aids, indicating that (i) imprecise agents are perceived as more human-like than precise agents when responding immediately, and (ii) unnaturally high levels of temporal precision can be compensated for by memory aid use. Further findings underscore the value of continued inquiry into cultural variations.},

We conduct two experiments (N=44, N=30) investigating multifractality in mouse movements during a computer game, replicating prior results and contributing new findings. Our results show that multifractality correlates with dimensions associated with readiness-to-hand, including skill and task-engagement, during tool breakdown, task learning and normal play.

This bias was significantly reduced when the order of information presentation was reversed such that people first saw substantive profile information related to their explicitly-stated preferences before seeing the profile name and photo.

Combining survey responses from 29,284 participants in 15 countries with server-logged data of Facebook use, we found that when people thought that Facebook was good for them and for society, time spent on the platform was not significantly associated with well-being. Conversely, when they thought Facebook was bad, greater time spent was associated with lower well-being. On average, there was a small, negative correlation between time spent and well-being and the causal direction is not known. Beliefs had a stronger moderating relationship when time-spent measures were self-reported rather than coming from server logs.

We find that playbooks can help simplify and support incident response efforts.

FluidMeet enables out-group members to overhear group conversations while allowing conversation groups to control their shared level of context.

Users appreciated that explanation feedback helped focus their efforts and provided directions for improvement. This resulted in explanations improving diversity compared to no feedback or feedback with scores only. Hence, our approach opens opportunities for explainable AI towards scalable and rich feedback for iterative crowd ideation and creativity support tools.},

To support designers who aim to engage in a participatory design process in EMS environments, we created and evaluated the Contextual Secondary Video Toolkit (CSVT). This method uses secondary video material and design cards that allow domain experts to identify and prioritise challenges in their work environment and generate design ideas that address them. We illustrate the effects of the CSVT on design processes by analysing four workshops during which aeromedical EMS staff explored the potential of augmented reality to support their work. Our results indicate that the CSVT can support reflection about work practices, aid the generation of design ideas, and facilitate genuine participation. Furthermore, our data indicates that the use of secondary video in design projects is appropriate and even has certain advantages compared to primary field video.},

We conducted a study to investigate the use of sensor data available on an off-the-shelf VR device and additional contextual information, including current activity and engagement of users, to predict opportune moments for sending notifications using deep learning models. Our analysis shows that using mainly sensor features could achieve 72% recall, 71% precision and 0.86 area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC); performance can be further improved to 81% recall, 82% precision, and 0.93 AUROC if information about activity and summarized user engagement is included.},

We interviewed 20 women gig workers to hear their unique experiences with these challenges. We found that gig platforms are gender-agnostic, meaning they do not acknowledge women’s experiences and the value they bring. By not enforcing anti-harassment policies in design, gig platforms also leave women workers vulnerable to bias and harassment. Due to the lack of support for immediate actions and in fear of losing access to work, women workers “brush off” harassment. In addition, the platforms’ dispatching and recommendation mechanisms do not acknowledge women’s contributions in perceived safety for customers and social support for peer workers.},

We address this gap by exploring the pro-sharing attitudes and privacy perceptions of 30 HEMS users and non-users through an interview study. While participants are concerned about data misuse and stigmatization, our analysis also reveals that incentives, altruism, trust, security and privacy, transparency and accountability encourage data sharing.

A quantitative evaluation revealed that the outputs of GANSpiration-based example suggestion approaches are relevant to the input design, and at the same time include diverse instances.

Recently, there is an emerging approach to conversational information systems for support-seeking of sexual violence survivors, featuring personalization with wide availability and anonymity. However, a single best solution might not exist as sexual violence survivors have different needs and purposes in seeking support channels. To better envision conversational support-seeking systems for sexual violence survivors, we explore personalization trade-offs in designing such information systems. We implement a high-fidelity prototype dialogue-based information system through four design workshop sessions with three professional caregivers and interviewed with four self-identified survivors using our prototype. We then identify two forms of personalization trade-offs for conversational support-seeking systems: (1) specificity and sensitivity in understanding users and (2) relevancy and inclusiveness in providing information. To handle these trade-offs, we propose a reversed approach that starts from designing information and inclusive tailoring that considers unspecified needs, respectively.},

Then, we conduct a within-subject user study in which 18 college instructors deliver lectures online with Glancee and two baselines, EngageClass and ZoomOnly. Results show that Glancee can effectively support online teaching and is perceived to be significantly more helpful than the baselines. We further investigate how instructors’ emotions, behaviors, attention, cognitive load, and trust are affected during the class.

However, it is difficult to design a complex motion and build a control system for large numbers of trusses. In this paper, we present PneuMesh, a novel truss-based shape-changing system that is easy to design and build but still able to achieve a range of tasks. PneuMesh accomplishes this by introducing an air channel connection strategy and reconfigurable constraint design that drastically decreases the number of control units without losing the complexity of shape-changing. We develop a design tool with real-time simulation to assist users in designing the shape and motion of truss-based shape-changing robots and devices. A design session with seven participants demonstrates that PneuMesh empowers users to design and build truss structures with a wide range of shapes and various functional motions.},

HydroMod consists of palm-sized small modules, which can generate liquid flow with the electrohydrodynamics (EHD) phenomenon by simply connecting the modules.

We found that problematic microtransactions with mobile games featuring more frequent and different techniques compared to desktop games. Across both, players minded issues related to fairness, transparency, and degraded user experience, supporting prior theoretical work, and importantly take issue with monetisation-driven design as such. We identify future research needs on why microtransactions in particular spark this critique, and which player communities it may be more or less representative of.},

We found that children actively interacted with the media character in the conversational videos and their parents spontaneously provided support in the process. We also found that the children who watched the conversational video performed better in the immediate, episode-specific science assessment compared to their peers who watched the broadcast, non-interactive version of the same episode. Several design implications are discussed for using conversational technologies to better support child active learning and parent involvement in video watching.},

We then designed ZenVR: an interactive system to deliver an eight-lesson meditation curriculum to support learners’ progress. In Phase II, we conducted a 6-week longitudinal lab-based evaluation with 15 novice meditation learners.

To support these practices digitally, Style Blink (“Style-Blocks+Ink”) explores handcrafted styling as a first-class object. Style-blocks encapsulate digital ink, enabling people to craft, modify, and reuse embellishments and decorations for larger structures, and apply custom layouts. For example, we provide interaction instruments that style ink for personal expression, inking palettes that afford creative experimentation, fillable pens that can be “loaded” with commands and actions to replace menu selections, techniques to customize inked structures post-creation by modifying the underlying handcrafted style-blocks and to re-layout the overall structure to match users’ preferred template. In effect, any ink stroke, notation, or sketch can be encapsulated as a style-object and re-purposed as a tool. Feedback from 13 users show the potential of style adaptation and re-use in individual sketching practices.},

To investigate the performance of the proposed teleportation methods, we conducted a controlled lab experiment (N = 24) with a mid-air coin collection task to assess accuracy, efficiency and VR sickness. We discovered that the linear aiming method leads to faster and more accurate target selection. Moreover, a combination of linear aiming and instant transitioning leads to the highest efficiency and accuracy without increasing VR sickness.},

However, this random probing can interrupt users and adversely influence users’ emotional states by inducing disturbance and stress. This work aims to understand how ESMs themselves may compromise the validity of ESM responses and what contextual factors contribute to changes in emotions when users respond to ESMs. Towards this goal, we analyze 2,227 samples of the mobile ESM data collected from 78 participants. Our results show ESM interruptions positively or negatively affected users’ emotional states in at least 38% of ESMs, and the changes in emotions are closely related to the contexts users were in prior to ESMs. Finally, we discuss the implications of using the ESM and possible considerations for mitigating the variability in emotional responses in the context of mobile data collection for affective computing.},

Novices, however, often plan on-the-fly during implementation, resulting in unsuccessful problem-solving due to lack of mental organization of the solution. Research shows that subgoal learning helps learners develop more complete solution plans by enhancing their understanding of the high-level solution structure. However, expert-created materials such as subgoal labels are necessary to provide learning benefits from subgoal learning, which are a scarce resource in self-learning due to limited availability and high cost. We propose a learnersourcing workflow that collects high-quality subgoal labels from learners by helping them improve their label quality. We implemented the workflow into AlgoSolve, a prototype interface that supports subgoal learning for algorithmic problems. A between-subjects study with 63 problem-solving novices revealed that AlgoSolve helped learners create higher-quality labels and more complete solution plans, compared to a baseline method known to be effective in subgoal learning.},

The system includes a context-based voice agent and two AI-driven collaborative strategies: the real-time transformation of children's telling into drawings, and the generation of abstract sketches with semantic similarity to existing story content. We conducted a 2 \texttimes{} 2 study with 64 children to evaluate the efficacy of StoryDrawer by varying the two strategies in four conditions.

As users increasingly type on the go, text input on mobile and wearable devices has had to compromise on full-size typing. In this paper, we present TapType, a mobile text entry system for full-size typing on passive surfaces—without an actual keyboard. From the inertial sensors inside a band on either wrist, TapType decodes and relates surface taps to a traditional QWERTY keyboard layout. The key novelty of our method is to predict the most likely character sequences by fusing the finger probabilities from our Bayesian neural network classifier with the characters’ prior probabilities from an n-gram language model. In our online evaluation, participants on average typed 19 words per minute with a character error rate of 0.6% after 30 minutes of training. Expert typists thereby consistently achieved more than 25&nbsp;WPM at a similar error rate. We demonstrate applications of TapType in mobile use around smartphones and tablets, as a complement to interaction in situated Mixed Reality outside visual control, and as an eyes-free mobile text input method using an audio feedback-only interface.},

We present a taxonomy of characteristics that defines the mobile usability of HITs for smartphone devices. The taxonomy is developed based on findings from a study of three consecutive steps. In Step 1, we establish an initial design of our taxonomy through a targeted literature analysis. In Step 2, we verify and extend the taxonomy through an online survey with Amazon Mechanical Turk crowdworkers. Finally, in Step 3 we demonstrate the taxonomy’s utility by applying it to analyze the mobile usability of a dataset of scraped HITs. In this paper, we present the iterative development of the taxonomy, highlighting the observed practices and preferences around mobile crowdwork.

Existing voice manipulation interfaces are often complex to use, and highly limited in their ability to modify vocal characteristics beyond small adjustments. To address these challenges, we designed a framework that allows users to explore and select from a large set of voices, and thereafter manipulate the voice(s) to converge towards an effective match for one they have in mind.

We found qualitative evidence that gaming was an often actively sought out and successful means of replenishing particular needs, but one that could ‘backfire’ for some through an appraisal process discounting gaming as ‘unreal’. Meanwhile, contrary to our predictions, the quantitative data showed a “rich get richer, poor get poorer” pattern: need satisfaction in daily life positively correlated with need satisfaction in games.

Our results revealed a counter-intuitive effect where reading round numbers helped people better approximate the precise values, while seeing precise numbers made them worse. We also conducted two surveys to elicit individual preferences for the ideal degree of rounding for numbers spanning seven orders of magnitude in various contexts. From the surveys, we found that people tended to prefer more precision when the rounding options contained only digits (e.g., ”2,500,000”) than when they contained modifier terms (e.g., ”2.5 million”).

It emerges that data structuring is subject to a complex network of incentives and constraints, including factors extrinsic to spreadsheets such as the user’s expertise, auxiliary tools, and collaborator needs. Moreover, we find that table columns are an important abstraction, and that operations such as conditional formatting, data validation, and formula authoring can be implemented on table columns, rather than cell ranges. To probe this, we designed 4 click-through prototypes for a follow-up study with 20 participants. We found that although column operations improved the value proposition of structured tables, they are unlikely to supplant the advantages of the flexible grid.},

Current contrastive explanations are rudimentary comparisons between examples or raw features, which remain difficult to interpret, since they lack semantic meaning. We argue that explanations must be more relatable to other concepts, hypotheticals, and associations. Inspired by the perceptual process from cognitive psychology, we propose the XAI Perceptual Processing Framework and RexNet model for relatable explainable AI with Contrastive Saliency, Counterfactual Synthetic, and Contrastive Cues explanations. We investigated the application of vocal emotion recognition, and implemented a modular multi-task deep neural network to predict and explain emotions from speech. From think-aloud and controlled studies, we found that counterfactual explanations were useful and further enhanced with semantic cues, but not saliency explanations. This work provides insights into providing and evaluating relatable contrastive explainable AI for perception applications.},

However, prototyping these systems is challenging, as it requires sophisticated technical skills, time, and often expensive hardware. We present VRception, a concept and toolkit for quick and easy prototyping of cross-reality systems. By simulating all levels of the reality-virtuality continuum entirely in Virtual Reality, our concept overcomes the asynchronicity of realities, eliminating technical obstacles. Our VRception Toolkit leverages this concept to allow rapid prototyping of cross-reality systems and easy remixing of elements from all continuum levels. We replicated six cross-reality papers using our toolkit and presented them to their authors. Interviews with them revealed that our toolkit sufficiently replicates their core functionalities and allows quick iterations. Additionally, remote participants used our toolkit in pairs to collaboratively implement prototypes in about eight minutes that they would have otherwise expected to take days.},

We see this rather "unusual" location for a conference as both an acknowledgement of the role underrepresented regions play in the field of Human-Computer Interaction as well as a symbol for more outreach to the rest of the world.The ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems is the premier international conference of Human-Computer Interaction. CHI - pronounced "kai" - is a place where researchers and practitioners gather from across the world to discuss the latest in interactive technology. We are a multicultural community from highly diverse backgrounds who together investigate new and creative ways for people to interact.CHI has a rich history of bringing together people from different disciplines, cultures, sectors, communities and backgrounds. Through CHI, designers, researchers and practitioners come together with the common purpose of creating technology that works for people and society.We are increasingly realizing how our technology use is changing how we delineate work and pleasure, how it is advancing our productivity but at the same time threatening our wellbeing. In choosing a beautiful location like Hawai'i, we hope we highlight the importance of work-life balance and also elicit new discussions on such critical perspectives about the future of interactive technology.Thanks to our massive numbers of volunteers and help from ACM and its SIGCHI members, we are excited to present a vibrant technical and social programme for you to experience. Over six days, participants can join and continue to engage with the CHI community and explore technology and world-class research, and engage in discussions with designers, researchers, students, and practitioners!Ho'omalu-o means "to conserve; to use or manage wisely" in the Hawaiian language. One of our goals for CHI 2020 is to make more sustainable choices wherever we can, recognising, of course, that any travel, especially to locations like ours, has a significant impact on the environment. Working with the Sustainability Chairs, we have chosen recycled, biodegradable or eco-friendly products and engaged with local suppliers, wherever possible. We have implemented options to reduce travel related to the conference organisation by using videoconference meetings as much as possible. We have worked with the CHI Steering and Executive Committee to identify future opportunities to reduce travel and to reduce the number of meetings. We have removed the conference bag and gifts by default and encouraged the selection of more sustainable food choices (including the decision not to serve red meat). We have also chosen reusable or compostable crockery and cutlery where possible and are donating any remaining food to a homeless shelter to avoid food waste.Furthermore, we have chosen to locate all activities in or near the Convention Centre and negotiated deals with hotels nearby to reduce the need for transportation. The Convention Centre itself is the first and only public assembly convention centre to earn LEED v.4 O+M Gold Certification in the United States. In the spirit of Ho'omaluo- , we have also decided to set the default temperature in the venue higher to reduce air condition energy usage.A particular highlight is the Interactivity programme, which will be launched at the Reception on Monday evening, giving a live glimpse into the future with hands-on prototypes, design experiences as well as inspirational technologies.We are also excited to continue the commitment to making CHI, and CHI content, more widely accessible. We will be live-streaming even more paper sessions. We also provide a nursing room, all-gender bathrooms, badge pronouns, a desensitization room and a prayer room.}

While there has been substantial research in recent years to build fair decision-making algorithms, there has been less research seeking to understand the factors that affect people's perceptions of fairness in these systems, which we argue is also important for their broader acceptance. In this research, we conduct an online experiment to better understand perceptions of fairness, focusing on three sets of factors: algorithm outcomes, algorithm development and deployment procedures, and individual differences. We find that people rate the algorithm as more fair when the algorithm predicts in their favor, even surpassing the negative effects of describing algorithms that are very biased against particular demographic groups. We find that this effect is moderated by several variables, including participants' education level, gender, and several aspects of the development procedure. Our findings suggest that systems that evaluate algorithmic fairness through users' feedback must consider the possibility of "outcome favorability" bias.},

We then study the theoretical performance envelopes of a context-aware sentence retrieval system, identifying potential keystroke savings as a function of the parameters of the subsystems, such as the accuracy of the underlying auto-complete word prediction algorithm and the accuracy of sensed context information under varying assumptions. We find that context-aware sentence retrieval has the potential to provide users with considerable improvements in keystroke savings under reasonable parameter assumptions of the underlying subsystems.

Thereafter, we synthesized 12 neutrally-spoken voice messages, validated (N=7) them, then tested (N=12) if thermal stimuli can augment their perception with affect. We found warm and cool stimuli (a) can be perceived on the chest, and quickly without fabric (4.7-5s) (b) do not incur discomfort (c) generally increase arousal of voice messages and (d) increase / decrease message valence, respectively. We discuss how thermal displays can augment voice perception, which can enhance voice assistants and support individuals with emotional prosody impairments.},

Transient (newer) authors of posts and comments on r/science use less specialized language than more frequent authors, and those that leave the community use less specialized language than those that stay, even when comparing their first comments. These findings suggest that the specialized language used in r/science has a gatekeeping effect, preventing participation by people whose language does not align with that used in r/science.

Recent work suggests that the interpretation of vertical deictic gestures can be significantly improved by warping the pointing arm. In this paper, we extend previous work by showing that models enable to also improve the interpretation of deictic gestures at targets all around the user. Through a study with 28 participants in a CVE, we analyzed the errors users make when interpreting deictic gestures. We derived a model that rotates the arm of a pointing user's avatar to improve the observing users' accuracy. A second study with 24 participants shows that we can improve observers' accuracy by 22.9%.

Similarly, if we are subjected to a vibrotactile stimulus with a frequency directly coupled to our actions, we do not experience vibration - instead we experience this as a material property. My thesis explores this phenomenon of 'material experience' in three parts. Part I contributes two novel devices, a flexible phone which provides haptic feedback as it is being deformed, and a system which can track a finger and simultaniously provide haptic feedback. Part II investigates how vibration is perceived, when coupled to motion: what are the effects of varying feedback parameters and what are the effects of different types of motion? Part III reflects and contextualizes the findings presented in the previous sections.

We assessed pre- and post-test changes in levels of self-efficacy, outcome expectation, and intent to act relating to various preparedness and response actions. We found that playing the game increases these scores significantly in all game conditions immediately after play. Where avatar characteristics were significant, more resources led to higher scores. However, contrary to our predictions, randomly assigned avatars led to higher increases in scores than when players chose and named their avatar. Future studies are planned to explore a variety of other game features designed to maximize motivation and behavior change in young adults.},

Yet, the agents can only be activated using specific voice commands, i.e. a wake word. This, in turn, requires the device to constantly listen to and process sound, which represents a privacy issue for some users. Further, using the trigger word for the agent in a conversation with another human may lead to accidental triggers. Here, we propose using gestural triggers for conversational agents. We conducted gesture elicitation to identify five candidate gestures. We then conducted a user study to investigate the acceptability and effort required to perform the gestures. Initial results indicate that the snap gesture shows the most potential. Our work contributes initial insights on using smart speakers with ubiquitous sensing.},

However, human hands can ergonomically move in a broader range than a smartphone's field of view (FOV) can capture, requiring users to be aware of the limited usable interaction and viewing regions at all times. We present Portalware, a smartphone-wearable dual-display system that expands the usable interaction region for free-hand manipulation and enables users to receive visual feedback outside the smartphone's view. The wearable is a lightweight, low-cost display that shares the same AR environment in real-time with the smartphone.This setup empowers AR applications such as mid-air drawing and object manipulation by providing a 180-degree horizontal interaction region in front of the user. Other potential applications include wearing the smartphone like a pendant while using Portalware to continue interacting with AR objects. Without having to hold their phone up with their hand, users can benefit from resting their arms as needed. Finally, we discuss usability explorations, potential interactions, and future plans for empirical studies.},

Previous research about adaptive browsing behavior of screen reader users is associated with a lack of webpage usability. In this study, we observed and compared the information seeking behavior of ten sighted and ten screen reader users. Findings show that screen reader users demonstrate adapted mental models of the visual information search interface. Additionally, their adaptive search result exploration strategies in the context of query intent highlight key concern areas in specific parts of the search process.},

We thus suggest that, by envisioning high-level API affordances as scaffolds, API designers can not only enhance users' productivity, but they can also help drive adoption of software components attempting to radically innovate on their past inheritance.

The result of focus interviews showed that visually impaired people could significantly distinguish and recognize the variation of color by grating textures.

This results in latency of hundreds of milliseconds for a single-tap event. To reduce the latency, we propose a novel machine-learning-based tap recognition method called "PredicTaps". In the PredicTaps method, by using touch-event data gathered from the capacitive touch surface, the system immediately predicts whether a detected tap is a single tap or the first tap of a double tap. Then, in accordance with the prediction, the system determines whether to execute a single-tap event immediately or wait for a subsequent second tap.

How would emerging sociotechnical systems further complicate the role of avatars in our online social lives? In this paper we focus on how people perceive and understand their avatars in social virtual reality (VR) - 3D virtual spaces where multiple users can interact with one another through VR head-mounted displays (HMDs). Based on 30 interviews, we identified three key themes emerging in people's perceptions and experiences of their avatars across various social VR applications. Our study contributes to further improving social VR technologies and better understanding emerging social interaction dynamics and consequences within social VR.},

However, the number of alternatives presented by most personal finance platforms pose novices a dual challenge of choice overload coupled with a lack of domain knowledge. We present a study investigating socially-informed sorting, in which users are offered subtle guidance in the form of visual and textual cues that aim to encourage information-seeking when choosing between large numbers of options. We evaluate this approach in an online experiment in which participants go through ten rounds of retirement saving budget allocation, making choices among 77 different funds. While we found that this technique increased novice investors' information-seeking, and offered significant benefit in terms of return performance, it may also be detrimental for more experienced investors. We discuss these findings in light of prior research.},

Our findings show that participants who were less interested in trying new diets were more willing to reduce calories when presented with a comparison to people unlike them, an out-group member comparison, while those who were interested in trying new diets were more willing to reduce calories regardless of social comparison type. These findings imply that one size does not fit all when nudging. More research is needed to see how social comparisons influence the effectiveness of digital health behavior projects.},

Our results indicate that the sense of presence improved significantly by visualizing the leg movement, synchronized or not. This in turn further enhanced the sense of body ownership especially when the leg motion was synchronized to that of the user (Synchronized Motion). However, a significant level of simulation sickness was reported when the virtual leg motion did not match the user's (Fixed Body and Prerecorded Animation). We discuss the implications for representing the avatar locomotion in immersive virtual environments.},

Multi-view and multi-modal learning have been considered useful for various complex tasks; however, an in-depth analysis or a large-scale dataset on multi-view, multi-modal gaze estimation under a long-distance setup with a low illumination is still very limited. To address these limitations, first, we construct a dataset of images captured under challenging conditions. And we propose a simple deep learning architecture that can handle multi-view multi-modal data for gaze estimation. Finally, we conduct a performance evaluation of the proposed network with the constructed dataset to understand the effects of multiple views of a user and multi-modality (RGB, depth, and infrared). We report various findings from our preliminary experimental results and expect this would be helpful for gaze estimation studies to deal with challenging conditions.},

We then provide insights into our findings and share our lessons learned regarding our workshop topic – AI and Space – our process, and our research. We learned that involving non-experts in complex technical discourses – such as AI – through the structural rigour of design methodology is a viable approach. We then conclude by laying out how others might use our findings and initiate their own workbook sprint to explore complex technologies in a human-centred way.},

To mitigate this need, researchers conceptualized approaches leveraging everyday physical objects as proxies instead. Transferring these approaches to varying physical environments and conditions, however, poses significant challenges to a variety of disciplines such as HCI, VR, haptics, tracking, perceptual science, design, etc. This workshop will explore the integration of everyday items for multi-sensory feedback in virtual experiences and sets course for respective future research endeavors.

I also tried to make it possible for ordinary people to program computers, since as long as people can only use predefined applications, they will be able to access only a fraction of the power of computers.These efforts have all appeared in commercial products, from the Xerox Star office computer to Stagecast Creator's educational software.

Designing the interior of your home will be as gratifying and immediate as a click is today, with modular digital furniture becoming the status quo and their design democratized and in the hands of users.In this paper, we present LightSpace, an exploration for the future of design for the home. LightSpace focuses on a very specific solution to a simple problem – designing and stylizing an entire room with playful delight in mind. With our small-scale proof-of-concept tangible user interface (TUI), we account for the direct physicality of designing within a physical space by allowing users to move mini 3D printed furniture in a projection mapped dollhouse and switch materials using a magical wand (NFC).This exploration acts as a small-scale vehicle for us to investigate the usefulness, feasibility, and possible ubiquity for such an interface in the future.},

This makes the Chinese mobile ecosystem a unique case study for investigating whether users actively choose app markets that conform to their preferences. We investigated this question in a survey of 200 Chinese users aged 18-49. Scenarios covered apps that require disclosure of different types of sensitive information (shopping, dating, health), with gaming as a baseline. Users preferred markets that were easy to use and had a wide choice of apps. Only nine users highlighted security as a feature. Despite this, they primarily used only one app market - the pre-installed one. App-market specific features were important for the game scenario, but less important for all others. We suggest that download decisions for most apps are made before users enter an app market, and discuss implications for presenting privacy and security information.},

Using the tool, children can imagine and code their own expressive, playful, and personally meaningful probabilistic projects, such as-generative art, music, or text; chance-based games and stories; interactive visualizations; and even advanced projects for making a computer learn from input data using simple Markov models of probabilistic learning, among many other creative possibilities.},

However, post-stimuli self-reports are temporally imprecise, especially after watching 360° videos. In this work, we design six continuous emotion annotation techniques for the Oculus Rift HMD aimed at minimizing workload and distraction.

In human-computer interaction (HCI) studies, perception biases against AI, machines, or computers are generally cited. However, experimental evidence is still lacking. This paper presents a wide-scale experiment in which 565 participants are asked to evaluate paintings (which were created by humans or AI) on four dimensions: liking, perceived beauty, novelty, and meaning. A priming effect is evaluated using two between-subject conditions: Artworks presented as created by an AI, and artworks presented as created by a human artist. Finally, the paintings perceived as being drawn by human are evaluated significantly more highly than those perceived as being made by AI. Thus, using such a methodology and sample in an unprecedented way, the results show a negative bias of perception towards AI and a preference bias towards human systems.},

We measured resonant properties as frequency properties using active acoustic sensing. Our method is applicable to 3D-printed objects with a low filling rate while reducing the workload of modeling the inner structure to be used as a tag. To investigate the feasibility of our method, we conducted two experimental evaluations. The results of one showed that our method can identify eight objects with an average classification accuracy of 99.3%.},

Noise and many-to-one mappings have a tendency to decrease the mutual information, potentially reducing the fidelity of a digital musical instrument. Also, musicians need to rehearse their performances in order to avoid making noisier gestures.Overall, it is hoped that this paper and other related papers by the authors can show how to quantify information processing in user interfaces for continuous control.},

	abstract     = {Service robots have yet to occupy niches in domestic environments beyond vacuuming and lawn mowing. This can only happen by providing an alternative experience rather than mimicking and competing with humans, pets and already available appliances. We argue that the robot's hybrid nature on a spectrum between 'thing' and 'being' is a suitable framework to create such a unique experience. More specifically, we argue that hybridity creates ambiguity which affords a wider range of practices to occur, from tool use to social interaction. We evaluate this idea in an online study with 61 participants who rated three robots with rather biomorphic (Pepper), hybrid (Sympartner) or device-like (Relay) appearance. Results show that the hybrid design affords a broader spectrum of use compared to designs inscribing to treat the robot as either possession or social companion. The study offers initial insights on ambiguity-through-hybridity as design strategy to help robots become domestic products.},

XAI is increasingly important in bringing transparency to fields such as medicine and criminal justice where AI informs high consequence decisions. While many XAI techniques have been proposed, few have been evaluated beyond anecdotal evidence. Our research offers a novel approach to assess how humans interpret AI explanations; we explore this by integrating XAI with Games with a Purpose (GWAP). XAI requires human evaluation at scale, and GWAP can be used for XAI tasks which are presented through rounds of play. This paper outlines the benefits of GWAP for XAI, and demonstrates application through our creation of a multi-player GWAP that focuses on explaining deep learning models trained for image recognition. Through our game, we seek to understand how humans select and interpret explanations used in image recognition systems, and bring empirical evidence on the validity of GWAP designs for XAI.},

By analyzing speech transcripts, checklist interaction logs, and videos of 15 resuscitations, we identified several tensions that arose from the use of a checklist in a team-based process with multi-step tasks. The tensions included incorrect markings of in-progress tasks as completed, failure to mark completed tasks due to missed communications, failure to record planned tasks, and difficulties in recording dynamic values. From these findings, we discuss design implications for checklist design for dynamic, team-based activities.},

A big part of the challenge is that no suitable mechanism exists to replace traditional intercept surveys in a way that ensures fairness and inclusion. The lack of labelled data has also impacted the training of AI algorithms. That is the lack of labels relevant to the target domains has made it hard to estimate the accuracy of the AI algorithms when they are applied to real world situations. In this paper, we propose a framework for collecting in-the-wild images and demographic labels from ordinary people (e.g., park visitors) that ensures that privacy is integrated at every stage of the data collection process from storage to processing and sharing.},

The Squeeze and Twist devices are wristbands that elicit squeezing and twisting sensations on the skin of the wrist. All of these devices are powered by shape memory alloy actuators, enabling them to be quiet, lightweight and discreet wearable interfaces, unlike their vibrotactile or servo-motor driven counterparts. We investigate the potential for these devices to be used in mediated social touch interactions by conducting preliminary psychometric tests measuring affective response. The Pinch device and Squeeze wristband were found to simulate positive affective touch sensations, particularly in comparison to vibrotactile stimuli.},

To this end IOAIL produced a system of standardised icons for attaching to products and systems to indicate both the presence of AI and to increase the legibility of that AI's attributes. Whilst the process of certification is voluntary it is becoming a mark of trust, enhancing the usability and acceptability of AI-infused products through improved legibility.

Recent advances in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technology could help remove some of these barriers that prevent DHH people from becoming involved in group meetings. However, ASR is still imperfect, and it contains errors in its output text in many real-world conversation settings. My research proposes to investigate whether there are benefits in using ASR technology to aid understanding and communication among DHH and hearing individuals. My dissertation research will evaluate the effectiveness of using ASR in small group meetings (through empirical studies with DHH and hearing participants), as well as develop guidelines for system design to encourage hearing participants to communicate and speak more clearly.},

In particular, women and the LGBTQ+ community are often disproportionately affected by severe forms of threats that could transfer to risks to their physical safety. However, safety tools and platform policies often assume users are more homogeneous which may not acknowledge the varying needs of vulnerable populations affected by social oppression. This problem is exacerbated in small closely-knit communities like the Caribbean where it may be difficult to recover from or avoid abusers. Although legislation for online safety exists, they are enforced in few countries throughout the region, and there are few cases of victims being heard in court. My dissertation work attempts to address this problem by developing a holistic understanding of how to design safety tools that acknowledge cultural differences, legislative constraints, and social oppression for vulnerable groups.},

Previous research has focused primarily on physical activity as a single task without consideration of numerous additional coinciding events that almost always co-occur. The most common concomitant, secondary task (i.e., dual-task) is related to the cognitive requirements associated with daily activity pursuits. Thus, any procedure designed to promote greater physical activity should include complex tasks. In addition, the older population is diverse, and therefore, physical activity should be personalized according to individual capabilities and skills. We intend to combine navigation as a secondary task to walking, as a task "instructor", guiding the users through their personalized routes and also provide an added value of doing physical activity outside the home.},

We present FoodFab, a system that allows users to control their food intake through modifying a food's internal structure via two 3D printing parameters: infill pattern and infill density. In two experiments with a total of 30 participants, we studied the effect of these parameters on users' chewing time that is known to affect people's feeling of satiety. Our results show that we can indeed modify the chewing time by varying infill pattern and density, and thus control perceived satiety.

One way to motivate people eating healthy is using gamification, i.e. using game elements in a non-game context. Often, a static set of gamification elements is used. However, research suggests that the motivational impact of gamification elements differs substantially across users, demanding personalized approaches. In this paper, we contribute to this by investigating the perception of frequently used gamification elements in the healthy eating domain and correlations to Hexad user types in an online study (N=237). To do so, we created storyboards illustrating these gamification elements and show their comprehensibility in a lab study (N=8). Our results validate and extend previous research in the healthy eating domain, underline the need for personalization and could be used to inform the design of gamified systems for healthy eating.},

While proposals have been put forth for hardening patterns, such as increasing the number of or changing the location of contact points, none of these proposals has been implemented in the decade-plus since the interface's launch. We propose a new approach; instead of increasing the individual complexity, users select two sequential Android patterns, so called Double Patterns, that are visually super imposed on one another. This allows more complexity without dramatically changing the interface. We report on our preliminary findings of a large user study (n=634) of Double Patterns, finding strong evidence that the scheme is highly usable and increases the complexity of user choice.},

To provide detachable constraints on the tube for bending, we developed a novel technique with a hook-and-loop fastener attached on the tube. We also designed software to convert 3D targeted object shape to the bending pattern of the tube. Furthermore, we implemented a prototype of a machine for the automation of the attaching process of the fastener on the tube.

While work has explored the design of turn-by-turn egocentric AR navigation interfaces, little work has explored the design of exocentric interfaces, which provide the user with an overview of their desired route. In response to this, we examined the impact of three different exocentric AR map displays on pedestrian navigation performance and user experience.

Based on the results of the study, we designed and implemented a social VR clinic to meet the identified requirements.

Participants found our calendar to be interesting and engaging. It especially made them think more about their bodies and appropriate times for particular activities. All in all, it supported participants in negotiating external demands and personal health and wellbeing.

We therefore propose a machine learning model to detect hypoglycemia on basis of data from smartwatch sensors gathered in a proof-of-concept study. In further work, we want to integrate our model in wearables and warn individuals with diabetes of possible hypoglycemia. However, presenting just the detection output alone might be confusing to a patient especially if it is a false positive result.

Although IME shows great application potentials, hardships still exist during design for the manufacturing stage. For example, printed 2D structures experience mechanical bending and stretching during vacuum forming. This results in challenges for designers to ensure precise circuit-to-3D mold registration or to prevent over deformation of circuit and attached components. To this end, we propose a software toolkit that provides real time 2D-to-3D mapping, guided structural and electrical circuit design with interactive user interface.

A lens is laid on a base map to avoid occlusion with the original and actual point locations. The lens can aggregate the data points at various spatial resolutions as map zoom level changes. We propose three primitives of resolution for spatial clustering: heatmap, circle, and grid, to generate and represent clusters in a separate mapping system. The lens and the base map are linked at all times. We also incorporate coordinated views into the ClusterLens system to facilitate context switching and comparison.

The rise of crowdsourcing platforms, in which a variety of tasks are offered in the form of an open call, might be an alternative source to help educators scale up project- based learning. But how do university students feel about executing crowdsourcing tasks instead of their typical assignments? In a study with 24 industrial design students we investigate students' attitudes on introducing crowdsourcing tasks as assignments. Based on our study we offer four suggestions to universities that consider integrating crowdsourcing tasks in their educational activities.},

They are used to inform different parts of the user's hand that an obstacle is detected. 8 people who are blind and 3 people who have low vision explored the IMC's handset by navigating an indoor obstacle path. The participants provided their feedback on the IMC's haptic notification system with regards to the intensity of the vibration and location of the vibrators and discussed various scenarios where the feedback will or will not be useful to them.

However, HMDs still have a well-known problem in that they hide the user's face when worn making it difficult for their avatars in VR space to communicate with each other because the users cannot relay their facial expressions and gaze information to their avatars. In this paper, we propose a new HMD constructed using polarizing plates that can capture the user's face and expressions while wearing it. The proposed method enables the user's face to be captured by an internal camera while blocking the scenery from the user's view using orthogonal polarizing plates. The proposed method can be implemented at low cost and can directly capture a full-color image of the user's face unlike conventional methods using infrared cameras. We implemented a prototype and confirmed that the proposed HMD captures the user's face while showing VR images. This paper discusses the unique characteristics and possible applications of the proposed method.},

Experimental groups showed an average increase in psychological wellbeing of 1.73 (std = 6.08), compared to 0.5 (std = 5.94) in control.

However, there is still a lack of quantitative research for evaluating the influence of the flow state on learning outcomes. One of the issues related to flow experience identification is that used techniques are often invasive or not suitable for massive applications. The current paper suggests a way to deal with this challenge. We describe a methodology based on multimodal learning analytics, aimed to provide automatic students' flow experience identification in the gamified assignments and measuring its influence on the learning outcomes. The application of the developed methodology showed that there are correlations between learning outcomes and flow state, but they depend on the initial level of the user. This finding suggests adding dynamic difficulty adjustment and other flow experience dimension to the gamified assignment.},

Accurately diagnosing a stroke as soon as possible after it occurs is difficult as it requires a subjective evaluation by a clinician in a hospital. With the narrow time window required for diagnosis, stroke evaluation would benefit from being aided by computational approaches that identify and quantify stroke symptoms in an efficient way. Here, we propose the design of a novel interface that provides clinicians with visualizations of the results of a machine learning-based technological aid for stroke diagnosis. To effectively support clinicians in determining stroke type, the proposed approach allows them to compare their own manual stroke evaluation with the results of the diagnostic system. By developing and evaluating our prototypes with neurologists, we explore how to best integrate technological aids into busy hospital workflows without burdening clinicians or biasing their decision making processes. We found that properly balancing the predictions of humans with that of technology is key to promoting the adoption of the latter in hospitals.},

In this paper, we describe the deployment of an app that both facilitates a new means of media dissemination using a novel incentive scheme, and enables content collection, from no-network areas. In partnership with CGNet Swara, we deployed our app in the rural Indian states of Chhattisgarh and Telangana. In one month, 20,955 stories were transferred through Bluetooth to 2,443 unique phones, for which a total of $930 in mobile airtime credits was disbursed to 307 of the 680 users that installed the app. In an 81-day period, 537 local stories were reported using the app from 117 unique users.

To distinguish a learner's guessing behavior from solution behavior, we present an explorative study of using motion features, which represent a learner's finger movements on a tablet screen. Our data was collected from the Missing Number game of KitKit School, a tablet-based math game designed for children from pre-K to grade 2 in elementary school. A total of 5,040 problem solving logs, which were collected from 168 students, were analyzed. A two-sample t-test showed a significant difference between guessing and solution behavior for four groups of motion features that indicate distance, curvedness, complexity, and pause (p&lt;0.001). Additionally, our empirical results showed the possibility of using motion features in automatic detection of guessing behavior. Our best model yielded an accuracy of 0.778 and AUC value of 0.851 by using the random forest classifier.},

With the availability of devices to mass market, new applications become possible, and new research problems open up. We offer a preliminary framework consisting of 2 orthogonal continua (virtual-real and human-thing) and 2 critical perspective (postphenomenology/posthumanism and cultural interface).

Recently, there has been a growing interest in including clinicians as builders of Do-It-Yourself (DIY) AT. To identify the needs of clinicians-as-makers, we investigated the challenges that clinicians faced as they volunteered in an AT building project where they were the primary designers and builders of assistive mobility devices for children. Through observation and co-building of modified ride-on toy cars with clinicians, we found that the rapid pace of development and transient relationship between user and builder did not allow for a complete assessment of the child's mobility. Furthermore, clinicians struggled to actualize concepts borne out of their clinical intent due to a lack of engineering skill. This study highlights the need for tools that support clinicians-as-makers in the AT maker process and a new conceptualization of the role of DIY-AT maker programs within the AT provider ecosystem.},

Standing in line at shops, stations, and other crowded places is one of such tasks. Therefore, we developed a system to detect and notify the distance to a person in front continuously by using a smartphone with a RGB camera and an infrared depth sensor. The system alerts three levels of distance via vibration patterns to allow users to start/stop moving forward to the right position at the right timing. To evaluate the effectiveness of the system, we performed a study with six blind people. We observed that the system enables blind participants to stand in line successfully, while also gaining more confidence.},

In this work, we crawled, annotated, and analyzed a corpus of real-world human-written figure captions. Our study results show that real-world captions usually consist of a finite set of caption units and that automatic figure captioning should be formulated as a multi-stage task. The first stage is to generate caption units with high accuracy and the second is to stitch together the units with diverse stitching patterns, to form a natural caption.},

Therefore, we presented an assistive robot, BlindPilot, which guides blind users to landmark objects using an intuitive handle. BlindPilot employs an RGB-D camera to detect the positions of target objects and uses LiDAR to build a 2D map of the surrounding area. On the basis of the sensing results, BlindPilot then generates a path to the object and guides the user safely. To evaluate our system, we also implemented a sound-based navigation system as a baseline system, and asked six blind participants to approach an empty chair using the two systems. We observed that BlindPilot enabled users to approach a chair faster with a greater feeling of security and less effort compared to the baseline system.},

However, it is not clear how they might be designed to combat social media addiction. In this late-breaking work, we aim at clarifying this issue by investigating how digital nudges can reduce the addictive features of social media and other addictive sites. More precisely, we present the design of NUDGE, a novel browser extension that aims to make social media less addictive by delivering digital nudges founded on behavioral science. We conducted a preliminary evaluation of NUDGE with 67 actual users and 14 university students. Our results show that NUDGE (1) helped users to become reflective of their social media usage, (2) possibly decreased their time spent, and (3) made the experience more pleasant.},

We propose that whether one would consider eating a particular electronic component offers a surprisingly useful heuristic for whether we ought to be producing it on mass with vanishingly short lifespans. We hypothesize that the adoption of this heuristic might affect user behaviour and present a diet plan for users who wish to take responsibility for their own e-waste by eating it. Finally we propose an alternative direction for HCI researchers to design and advocate for those affected by the material properties of e-waste.},

For this, we plan to create a space for discussing and sharing principles and strategies to design interactions and evaluate user interfaces (UI) for the ageing population. We thus welcome contributions of empirical studies, theories, design, and evaluation of UIs for older adults. Building on the success of last two year's workshops, we aim to grow the community of CHI researchers across borders interested in this topic by fostering a space to exchange results, methods, approaches, and ideas from research on interactive applications in support of older adults that are reflective of international diversity that is representative of CHI.},

In HCI, this understanding has been incorporated in concepts like embodied interaction, bodily play, and natural user-interfaces. However, while embodied cognition suggests a strong connection between motor activity and memory, we find the design of technological systems that target this connection to be largely overlooked. Considering this, we are provided with an opportunity to extend human capabilities through augmenting motor memory. Augmentation of motor memory is now possible with the advent of new and emerging technologies including neuromodulation, electric stimulation, brain-computer interfaces, and adaptive intelligent systems. This workshop aims to explore the possibility of augmenting motor memory using these and other technologies. In doing so, we stand to benefit not only from new technologies and interactions, but also a means to further study cognition.},

Drag:on leverages the airflow at the controller during interaction. The device adjusts its surface area to change the drag and rotational inertia felt by the user. When rotated or swung, Drag:on, conveys an impression of resistance, which we previously used in a VR user study to increase the haptic realism of virtual objects and interactions compared to standard controllers. Drag:on's feedback is suitable for rendering virtual mechanical resistances, virtual gas streams, and virtual objects differing in scale, material and fill state. In our demonstration, participants learn about this novel feedback concept, the implementation of our prototype and can experience the resistance feedback during a hands-on session.},

We designed our system as a Chrome extension and evaluated it by testing its accuracy on a dataset of websites with and without sensitive content, and performing a user-interaction lab study. With promising future areas of research such as the ability to personalize thresholds and customize content warnings for specific user needs, this research is a step towards a psychologically safer internet for everyone.},

In a preliminary study with 14 participants, we investigated PinchType's speed and accuracy on initial use, as well as its physical comfort relative to a mid-air keyboard. After entering 40 phrases, most people reported that PinchType was more comfortable than the mid-air keyboard.

Our device is based on a recent exploit that leverages the fact that when exposed to ultrasonic noise, commodity microphones will leak the noise into the audible range. This allowed us to build a novel wearable microphone jammer that is worn as a bracelet on the user's wrist and jams ubiquitously. We found that our device outperforms state-of-the-art jammers. (1) Existing jammers built from multiple transducers exhibit blind spots, i.e., locations in which transducers destructively interfere and where a microphone cannot be jammed; instead, our wearable jammer leverages natural hand gestures that occur while speaking, gesturing or moving around to blur out blind spots. (2) Existing jammers are directional, requiring users to point the jammer to a microphone; instead, our wearable jams in multiple directions. This is beneficial in that it allows our jammer to even protect against microphones out of sight, such as those hidden behind everyday objects.},

However, creating in VR/AR introduces new control, precision, and ergonomic challenges. Designing interactive tools for 3D creation is therefore non-trivial. A deep understanding of human factors, user preferences, as well as biases stemming from users' experience with 2D tools is essential to develop effective creative tools for VR/AR. My research combines exploratory user studies and technical advancements to build novel tools for creating 3D content in immersive spaces. I present two computer graphics applications which utilize 3D interactions to improve existing creative workflows and devise novel ones for visual creative expression in three-dimensions.

	abstract     = {ATHack, an annual assistive technologies hackathon at MIT, is unique in that community members living with disabilities (co-designers) propose projects and work with hackers to create prototypes over a two-week period. Since 2014, over 75 co-designers and 400 students have participated in ATHack. We present an overview of the program goals and implementation and share our reflections on the strengths and challenges surrounding the event as organizers, participants, and co-designers. Our reflections include that open communication between co-designers and participants is crucial, and that working on well-scoped, feasible projects is motivating for participants. From a survey (n=48) of ATHack participants from 2014-2019, 89% of respondents would recommend the event and 75% reported that they learned about disability and user-centered design. Our reflections suggest that the collaborative hackathon model can engage students spark innovations in accessible interfaces. We hope this report will inspire and guide others in implementing similar educational and design initiatives.},

Meanwhile, it features a context-trigger mechanism of ESM as a backup to remind users of labeling. Our preliminary evaluation of CAR with nine participants, who collected and labeled their mobility activity data for 15 weekdays, showed that compared with PART and ESM, participants collected a larger amount of annotated mobility data using CAR. In addition, participants had a higher annotation rate when using CAR than when using ESM. Our results show that the hybrid approach that combines manual and automated recording is promising. Our future work is validating these results and measure more metrics related to compliance with more participants.},

Researchers have leveraged novel structure design and material techniques to create a wide range of 4D shapes. Meanwhile, 4D printing texture (i.e., shape-changing texture) on objects which could easily augment the haptic sensation, has drawn more attention to this field. In this paper, we introduce 4DTexture, a novel design and fabrication approach that integrates texture design through the 4D printing process. Compared to conventional 3D printing surfaces with texture, which usually requires support structures, 4DTexture can effectively reduce production material, time and the post-process effort after printing. Specifically, 4DTexture prints flat substrates with a customized texture design on its top surfaces, which can easily be triggered and can self-morph to target 3D shapes. Overall, our approach enables the design and fabrication of 3D surfaces with texture and can be leveraged by designers and researchers in the field of personal fabrication.},

While using the Labo VR, the user must hold the Labo HMD with both hands and this prevents the simultaneous use of other input devices. To overcome this limitation, we developed L-Visor which mimics Labo VR HMD but frees the hands to widen the virtual reality experience. In addition, we developed four prototype games for use with L-Visor. The results of our pilot user study showed that participants had positive impressions of L-Visor, because they felt L-Visor was intuitively consistent with the game content. This paper shows how to expand DIY's value in VR by creating a new cardboard visor input device for the Labo head-mounted display and by customizing game contents which allow users to interact with virtual environments in their own way.},

Through semi-structured developer interviews, and two document-creation exercises, we have assembled a clearer picture of these needs and the various challenges faced in creating accurate and useful AI documentation.

The proposed method triangulates GPS and physiological data to create emotional maps, which outline geographical areas where users experienced specific emotional states in outdoor environments. The method is implemented as a small portable recording device, and a data visualization software. A field study was conducted in an amusement park to test the proposed approach. Emotional maps highlighting the areas where users experienced varying levels of arousal are presented.

However, dissent can be productive by sparking discussions that drive the evolution of community norms and boundaries, and there is value in understanding the role of moderation in this process. Our work draws on an exploratory analysis of moderation practices in the MetaFilter community, focusing on cases of intervention and response. We identify and analyse MetaFilter moderation with the metaphor: "taking care of a fruit tree", which is quoted from an interview with moderators on MetaFilter. We address the relevance of care as it is evidenced in these MetaFilter exchanges, and discuss what it might mean to approach an analysis of online moderation practices with a focus on nurturing care. We consider how HCI researchers might make use of care-as-nurture as a frame to identify multi-faceted and nuanced concepts characterising dissent and to develop tools for the sustainable support of online communities and their moderators.},

Through interviews and interactions with fashion professionals, we identified quantitative-style classification criteria and analysis requirements in decision making. Based on such design guidelines, we introduce FashionQ (Fashion Quant), which provides three main features: A quantitative-based style clustering (FashionQStyle), style trend analysis (FashionQTrend), and style comparison analysis (FashionQMap).

It does this by making sounds and visual effects and requires that the wearers coordinate shaking their feet and helping the creatures face each other. If Flippo is satisfied with the interaction it displays a light animation and plays 'happy' tunes, and if not it nudges the wearer again.

	abstract     = {Previous research has found that people often make time estimation errors in their daily planning at work. However, there is limited insight on the types of estimation errors found in different knowledge work tasks. This one-day diary study with 20 academics compared the tasks people aimed to achieve in the morning with what they actually did during the day. Results showed that participants were good at estimating the duration of time-constrained tasks, such as meetings, however they were biased when estimating the time they would spend on less time-constrained tasks. Particularly, the time needed for email and coding tasks was underestimated, whereas the time needed for writing research and planning activities was overestimated. The findings extend previous research by measuring in situ whether some tasks are more prone to time estimation errors than others. Planning and scheduling (AI) tools could incorporate this knowledge to help people overcome these time estimation biases in their work.},

Inspired by metaphors from software engineering, SCRAM extends high-level deep learning development tools to interpret model metrics during training and produce human-readable error messages. We validate SCRAM through three author-created example scenarios with image and text datasets, and by collecting informal feedback from ML researchers with teaching experience.

In-game death can drive player perceptions of difficulty and greatly impact the core player experience; however, there is surprisingly limited amounts of research examining how games actually handle this occurrence. We posit that this is a rich, underexplored space with significant implications for player experience and the design of many games. This paper presents our initial exploration into the space of player death and rebirth through the creation of a generalized taxonomy developed from 62 recent platformer games. Our taxonomy consists of five key dimensions: 1) obstacles, 2) death conditions, 3) aesthetics, 4) changes to player progress, and 5) respawn locations.},

In this work, we propose a machine-learning approach where the structure of an exploratory analysis session is automatically learned. Our method, based on Hidden-Markov Models, automatically builds a storyline of past exploration from log data events, that shows key analysis scenarios and the transitions between analysts' hypotheses and research questions. Compared to a clustering method, this approach yields higher accuracy for detecting transitions between analysis scenarios. We argue for incorporating provenance views in exploratory data analysis systems that show, at minimum, the structure and intermediate results of past exploration. Besides helping the reproducibility of the different analyses and their results, this can encourage analysts to reflect upon and ultimately adapt their exploration strategies.},

Via an online video-prototype study on a service robot with 94 Chinese participants, we find that users could tolerate up to 4s delay but their satisfaction drops at the 8s delay during both information-retrieval conversations and chitchats. We gain an in-depth understanding of users' preference for the trade-off between the voice quality and the response speed, as well as their opinions on possible robot graphic user interface (GUI) design to alleviate negative user experience with response latency.},

As a first step to understanding what we can learn from these stakeholders to aid the design of exergames, we conducted one in-depth interview with a PE teacher and several focus groups with children. Our findings showed that, although both children and the PE teacher like similar game elements, children viewed the elements through the lens of fun while the PE teacher viewed the elements through the lens of effectiveness.

Hardware developments provide the ubiquitous accessibility of eye recording, allowing eye movements to enter common usage as a control modality. Recent A.I. developments provide powerful computational means to make predictions about the user. However, the connection between eye movements and cognitive state has been largely under-exploited in HCI. Despite the rich literature in psychology, a deeper understanding of its usability in practice is still required. This EMICS SIG will provide an opportunity to discuss possible application scenarios and HCI interfaces to infer users' mental state from eye movements. It will bring together researchers across disciplines with the goal of expanding shared knowledge, discussing innovative research directions and methods, fostering future collaborations around the use of eye movements as an interface to cognitive state, and providing a solid foundation for an EMICS workshop at CHI 2021.},

In particular, the workshop will survey and map topics such as: interaction design for text and voice-based CUI; the interplay between engineering efforts such as in Natural language Processing (NLP) and the design of CUI; practical CUI applications (e.g. human-robot interaction, public spaces, hands-free and wearables); and social, contextual, and cultural aspects of CUI design (e.g. ethics, privacy, trust, information exploration, persuasion, well-being, or decision-making, marginalized users). By drawing from the diverse interdisciplinary expertise that defines CHI, we are proposing this workshop as a platform on which to build a community that is better equipped to tackle an emerging field that is rapidly-evolving, yet is under-studied --- especially as the commercial advances seem to outpace the scholarly research in this space.},

In tandem, local HCI initiatives such as ArabHCI [3] have emerged to address the misrepresentation of these populations in HCI research, highlighting the fact that Western originated design methods would require delicate adaptations to suit non-Western cultural contexts. With the same approach towards inclusivity and co-existence the aim of this workshop is to bring together HCI researchers and practitioners who engage in studies and interventions within Muslim majority communities around the world. The goal is to understand the Muslim identity and perceptions around it, the unique constraints and limitations within Muslim communities and to identify core issues and concerns within these populations.

Discussions and design activities will be supported by conceptual resources for design, lived experience accounts, design methods and ethical resources.

The integration of these sensors allows us to determine additional insights into human behavior, including where the viewer is focusing their attention, and monitor cognitive load.

However, most of the work done in literature tackles this problem from a pure Machine Learning point of view, disregarding real-case scenarios and the human interaction with systems able to generate outfits. This work tries to move the problem of generating outfits to the Recommender Systems domain by presenting as its main contribution a novel algorithm for a fashion-specific Recommender System that generates fashionable outfits, able to scale its inference time to be useful in real use case scenarios, and applies such algorithm on public and industrial datasets. In addition to this, this work shows preliminary results on how this algorithm can be employed in a real scenario and reports as preliminary results the evaluations provided by three professional stylists on the outfits generated by such algorithms.},

The design space generates alternatives for use in a visual drug report design study that may improve decision-making concerning illicit drug use. Currently, communication of drug checking test results does not capture the uncertainty in drug checking tests, leading to poor and potentially harmful decisions. The design alternatives generated by the design space aim to empower people who use drugs with drug sample information and facilitate harm reduction efforts. Our visualizations may apply to other drug checking services and to scenarios where uncertainty visualization researchers wish to notify end users of the presence of unquantified uncertainty in safety-critical decision-making contexts like those found during the opioid crisis.},

We asked users to rate a set of movies while collecting individual response times, confidence levels, and reasons for user ratings. We investigate (1) the possibility of utilizing response time as a way to further distinguish likes and dislikes, and (2) the various factors that affect rating time. We find that response time can be used to distinguish between sure and unsure answers, as well as the mental process users take before rating an item.

In this paper, we present ViTune, a visualizer tool that enhances the musical experiences of the DHH through the use of an on-screen visualizer generating effects alongside music. We observed how members of the DHH community typically experienced music through an initial user study. We then iterated on developing a visualizer prototype where we did multiple usability tests involving at least 15 participants from the DHH community. We observed how they experienced music with the help of our prototype and noticed that certain music features and elements augmented these experiences. Visualization attributes, their matching qualitative descriptions and equivalent subjective attributes were identified with the help of music experts. Also, affects hypothesized to be induced and dissuaded were identified in improving these listening experiences.},

By integrating conductive elements into the tangibles' sides, communication between embedded microprocessors is enabled, such that a connected composition can be computed without relying on any marker tracking information. Consequently, the virtual counterparts of the tangibles can be aligned, and this virtual composition can be attached to a single marker as a whole, increasing the tracking robustness towards occlusions and perspective distortions. A technical evaluation shows that this approach provides more robust augmentations if a tangible block in a composition is occluded by at least 50% or perspectively distorted by at least 40 to 50 degrees, depending on the block's size. Additionally, a test with users relying on the use case of a couch configuration tool shows promising results regarding usability and user experience.},

The results showed that participants perceived the suggestion of AI more reasonable and accepted it more when the performance is not stated than any information is provided and they perceived the suggestion of AI more reasonable when the message is presented before the decision is made.

People often regret using their resources unfavorably (i.e., buyers' remorse or impulse buying) or take the pleasure of having something for granted before long (i.e., hedonic adaptation). Given its effects on optimizing positive experiences, positive emotion regulation can be useful for mitigating these issues. The present paper introduces PurPal, a self-administered behavioral intervention technology that enables users to up-regulate their positive emotions in the context of consumption. PurPal provides adaptive questions associated with users' purchase intentions, which stimulate reflection on possible future positive experiences with purchased items. A user study is planned to validate the efficacy of PurPal in a lab setting. The longer-term goal of the current research is to develop behavioral intervention technologies that support users' emotion regulation processes, enhancing their subjective well-being.},

The instrument has been used professionally across the world. In doing so the designers have created hundreds of mappings of movement to sound, along with a real-time visualisation system that uses the same movement data from handheld motion controllers to unify the sound, graphics and movement. The instrument has shown to have a broad appeal beyond professional practice, which has led to hands-on demos with children through to older people. We invite visitors, for the first time, to play not only with the AirSticks, but also with the latest iteration of our audio-visual system, to inspire new collaborations in the field of computer-human interaction. We argue that we need more new tools to unlock people's creativity through moving, listening and music making.},

Our study investigated the effect of nonverbal vocal cues in speech interaction on the user's perception toward the agent. 39 university students participated in the experiment, and MANOVA was tested to analyze their responses regarding intimacy, similarity, connectedness, enjoyment, and ease of use. The study result showed that using nonverbal vocal cues on empathic feedback contributes to establishing an interpersonal relationship with the agent, which gives implications to the fields of human-centered agent design.},

While SSO is designed to make the login process more seamless and convenient, recent social media data breaches may give pause to users by raising security concerns about their online transactions. In particular, users logging into sensitive services, such as dating apps, may feel hesitant to adopt SSO due to perceived potential data leakage to their social networks. We tested this proposition through a user study (N = 364) and found that individual differences in online security perceptions predict the use of SSO for certain sensitive services (e.g., affair apps), but not others (e.g., matchmaking apps). Informed by theory, potential mediators of this relationship (perceived security, ease of sharing, and usability) were also explored, thus shedding light on psychologically salient drivers of SSO adoption.},

We develop a task that requires learning Rust syntax and comprehending the Rust-specific approach to mutability and ownership. Our results show that users spend 43% of online time viewing example code and that programmers appreciate in-line compiler errors, choosing to refresh, on average, every 30.6 seconds after first discovering this feature. The average time between these refreshes predicted total task time, but individual resource choices did not. Based on our findings we offer design implications for language and IDE developers.},

In this preliminary work, we ask "are students' needs being met by existing applications for collaborative coding"? A survey was distributed to students and faculty of computer science to determine if students had experience collaborating on programming projects and identify what applications, if any, they used to facilitate their collaborations. Survey respondents were also asked about the strengths and weaknesses of the applications they used. From the 126 student responses and 23 faculty responses representing 31 unique institutions, over 50 applications were mentioned. We manually clustered the applications based on their affordances and used participant responses to identify opportunities for improvement. We found that many students are retrofitting non-coding applications for their programming projects as a workaround to facing the large learning curves that many collaborative coding tools require. Our findings suggest a need for more novice-friendly collaborative tools.},

In this work, we investigated the importance of integrating virtual representations of the climber's hands and/or feet in VR climbing systems. We present a basic solution to track, calibrate and represent the climber's hands and feet, and report the results of a user study, comparing the importance of virtual limb representations in terms of perceived hand and feet movement accuracy, and enjoyability of the VR climbing experience. Our study suggests that the inclusion of feet is more important than having a hand visualization.},

We identified a set of design considerations that focused on enriching data collection, improving the accessibility of information, and blending the decision support into the workflow. To demonstrate these insights, we developed the concept of an AI-based OH consultation, called ConsultAI.

These uses cases assume different user personas, will likely require different explanation strategies, and are not evenly addressed by current XAI tools.

Specifically, we report three single case studies with a functional prototype. This prototype supported creating implementation intentions, putting them into a calendar, and being reminded through an object representative for the planned activity. Through the prototype, all three participants engaged more in the activities chosen to fulfill the intention. All in all, the notion of supporting individual implementation intentions through technology seems a viable strategy to support behavior change.},

Real-time key information and awareness is presented in augmented reality (AR) by using interactive visual elements and auditive instructions. This paper describes a solution running on smartphones by using spatial computing capabilities for positional determination, tracking the user movements over the environment space. Besides the user-friendly minimalistic visual interface, the system is also able to instruct, guiding a completely blind person from a start position into a certain destination, avoiding obstacles. The communication is completely independent and uses voice recognition for accessibility capabilities.},

Indeed, eight in ten of our participants believed their favorite font would be their best. Instead, our findings showed that the preferred font was seldom best, and one font did not fit all. Adult readers in our study read better with varying fonts. An average 117 word per minute difference between worst and best typeface, or around 10 additional pages an hour, means font choice is of real-world significance. Our discussion focuses on the challenges of rapidly identifying an individual's optimal font, and the exciting individuation technologies such an advance allows.},

In order to create urban spaces that encourage cycling and walking, we propose a VR (Virtual Reality) pedestrian simulator which involves walk-in-place locomotion. Thus, identical conditions are obtained for all subjects which is not feasible in real world field research with naturally varying environmental influences. As a first step, our qualitative and quantitative user study revealed that walking in a VR treadmill felt safest and most intuitive, although walking in it took in return more energy than walking-in-place with VR trackers only.},

Second, interactivity with augmented reality along the complete machine learning pipeline fosters rapid modeling. Third, collaboration enables a multi-user setting, wherein machine learning engineers and domain experts can jointly discuss the behavior of machine learning models. The effectiveness of our proof-of-concept is demonstrated in an experimental study involving both students and business professionals.

The hardware was developed using electronic, counterweight, and shape modules that can be manipulated to build underwater robots. The software application allows children to learn concepts and receive construction feedback.

We believe that a usable and functional system for circuit design needs to be able to interleave both levels of abstraction seamlessly and allow designers to transition between them freely. Existing work has experimented with approaches like circuit synthesis, functional characterization, or fine grained physical modeling. Each of these approaches augment the design process as it exists today, with its fundamental split between various levels of abstraction. We notice that hierarchical block diagrams can capture both high-level system structure as well as fine grained physical connectivity, and use that symmetry to construct a model for electronic circuits that can span the entire design process. Additionally, we construct user interfaces for our model that can support users of different skill levels throughout a design task. We discuss the design of our system, detailing both fundamental abstractions and usability trade-offs, and demonstrate its current capabilities through the design of example electronics projects.},

Professional caregivers aim to build social relations with residents in dementia care homes to empower and socially include them during everyday care. However, the natural imbalance between the caregiver and the cared-for positions the person with dementia in a passive role, making it difficult for them to initiate and build relations with caregivers. In this paper, we present 'Turnaround' as a design exploration into care relations and the potential role of design to support these relations. Turnaround is a musical interface to facilitate collaborative acts of music-making. Our preliminary results reveal how the role of resident and caregiver shifted towards equal partnership during the exploration and interaction with Turnaround. Furthermore, we argue that technologies should foster partnerships in care activities by facilitating shared forms of expression and reinforcement of agency.},

We investigated a seminar in which design students built machines for musicians to improvise with. We explored the experiences of musicians when improvising with non-human musicians, as well as the challenges of designing non-human musicians. Among other things, we found that while from an outside perspective, the machines appeared as independent actors that interact with the musicians, the musicians experienced them as additional instruments they controlled. The interaction design of non-human actors was challenging for designers.},

I present a situated analysis of a CHI paper, "Design for Collaborative Survival," to propose an embodied method of reading through situated action that enables communication and expansion of the knowledge beyond the text. I responded to each of the concepts in that paper in an active way to better approach the authors' tacit knowledge by developing my own. Through this activity I intend to stimulate discussion on how authors and readers can benefit from similar methods that take reading beyond the text.},

In turn, this challenges the assumed targeted audience, intentionality, and pedagogical approaches of traditional HCI educational structures. Drawing from Latin American decolonial thinking, we reflect on our experiences as Latin American students seeking a graduate education in the United States. From there, we discuss paths for HCI educators and students to engage with the co-creation of pluriversal learning spaces that resist universal notions of language, class content, and knowledge production. As we build a more inclusive research community, these discussions become critical for imagining an HCI education aware of its social and political dimensions.},

We further varied rates of "learning" and personalization with the system to test user preferences and changes in participants' linguistic and psychological interactions with an unadapted versus adapted user model, and to determine whether those changes were attributable to acclimatization with the system or to the modeling capabilities, seeking to address 3 research questions: What are the psycholinguistic characteristics of user interactions with a dialogue system designed to act as a scheduling assistant? How does a system's ability to learn about a user and maintain a user model affect these interactions? Are changes in interaction styles uniquely attributable to user modeling ability rather than simply user familiarity or acclimation with the system? We present a linguistic analysis of the results using summary measures generated by a widely used psycholinguistic text analysis tool. Some of the measures seem to present the slightly paradoxical effect of reduced user engagement when a conversational agent explicitly discloses information about its user model to the user. These results suggest that future studies should take care to consider the degree to which the user model is directly exposed to the user. That is, being overly forthcoming about what has been learned about a user may undermine attempts to tailor conversational agents to actively engage and relate to users.},

Although the combination of state-of-the-art technology with human expertise is undoubtedly valuable in the industry context, designing a user-centered tool that fits in the everyday activities of knowledge workers – supporting and augmenting their potential – is not a trivial work. User research uncovers pain points and opportunities, bringing the insights that inspire designers and Human Computer Interaction (HCI) experts. It allows a clear understanding of the context, which is the essence of a consistent interaction experience. Nevertheless, revealing the UX of the application and how AI in this context reshapes knowledge workers' everyday tasks is not straightforward and might also be an iterative process.

A case study reveals that design students are able to take all four considerations into account in the application of the IAC. However, the fourth consideration - to take contextual considerations into account - poses a significant challenge to them. Our discussion of this finding leads us to two obstacles for the application of the IAC in design education. Based on this discussion, we concluded that the fourth consideration may have to be replaced by the consideration to let the context of use directly inform the design process.},

	abstract     = {Some years ago, I began to read environmental philosophy such as deep ecology and Marxist interpretations. At the time I did not know what to do with this material, but my tree hugging instincts and experience of having seen my rural grandparents live a decent but very simple life inspired an abiding interest in the topics these philosophers were writing about. My grandparents grew a lot of their own food, kept an ancient car that my grandfather maintained, and enjoyed strong social ties with family and friends. It seems now that we must develop our own forms of simplicity and self-reliance if we are to weather the devastations the market economy is visiting on the planet. When I discovered computing colleagues worried about the same environmental issues I was, we collaborated to create the Computing within LIMITS community.LIMITS is a series of workshops focused on how to use computing tools and strategies to address global environmental problems. Inspired by the classic 1972 Limits to Growth report (itself a product of computing), the premise is that we must accept and embrace the reality that we live on a finite planet. That reality must inform and animate our work. The first LIMITS Workshop was held in 2015, with one each year since. The Sixth Annual Workshop is in June.Most computing research does not address or take into account the finiteness of Earth. In 2018, I first authored a paper with LIMITS colleagues for Communications of the ACM to discuss this matter. I was skeptical of acceptance, but perhaps it is a sign of the times that reviewers were surprisingly positive. The paper argues that problems of sustainability are socioeconomic in origin, and we can turn to the field of ecological economics to set a course. In a subsequent paper, "Design in the Age of Climate Change," I examined social movements that consider sustainability within an economic frame, such as the post-growth movement in Europe, the Transition Town movement, and food sovereignty movements worldwide. These movements draw from earlier ideas such as Gandhi's notion of abundance within simplicity.},

In this work, we explore haptic feedback on the wrist for interacting with virtual objects. We use Tasbi, a compact bracelet device capable of rendering complex multisensory squeeze and vibrotactile feedback. Leveraging Tasbi's haptic rendering, and using standard visual and audio rendering of a head mounted display, we present several interactions that tightly integrate sensory substitutive haptics with visual and audio cues. Interactions include push/pull buttons, rotary knobs, textures, rigid body weight and inertia, and several custom bimanual manipulations such as shooting an arrow from a bow. These demonstrations suggest that wrist-based haptic feedback substantially improves virtual hand-based interactions in AR/VR compared to no haptic feedback.},

To verify the effectiveness of the proposed system, we conducted a user study and examined if the face to path angle of the putter changed when the weight was switched to different positions. In the user study, the participant performed putting with different switching angles. In the analysis, we focused on the differences in the face to path angle among the switching angles. The user study showed that the proposed system is effective in changing the face to path angle when switching the weight away from the putter's shaft. Based on the experimental results, the proposed system contributes to affecting the face to path angle dynamically in real-time.},

We conducted a study using a Wizard-of-Oz method to observe children's behavior and interview both parents and children to examine their needs in ABs. Using an affinity diagram, we grouped children's and parents' needs under the following categories: entertainment, communication, personal behavior, trust and desires.

	abstract     = {Eye-hand coordination training systems are used to improve user performance during fast movements in sports training. In this work, we explored gaze tracking in a Virtual Reality (VR) sports training system with a VR headset. Twelve subjects performed a pointing study with or without passive haptic feedback. Results showed that subjects spent an average of 0.55 s to visually find and another 0.25 s before their finger selected a target. We also identified that, passive haptic feedback did not increase the performance of the user. Moreover, gaze tracker accuracy significantly deteriorated when subjects looked below their eye level. Our results also point out that practitioners/trainers should focus on reducing the time spent on searching for the next target to improve their performance through VR eye-hand coordination training systems. We believe that current VR eye-hand coordination training systems are ready to be evaluated with athletes.},

One problem of such head-mounted displays is the distraction caused by an unavoidable display of control elements even when focused on internal thoughts. In this project, we reduced this distraction by including information about the current attentional state. A multimodal smart-home environment was altered to adapt to the user's state of attention. The system only responded if the attentional orientation was classified as "external". The classification was based on multimodal EEG and eye tracking data. Seven users tested the attention-aware system in comparison to the unaware system. We show that the adaptation of the interface improved the usability of the system. We conclude that more systems would benefit from awareness of the user's ongoing attentional state.},

We recruited ten children to play Apraxia World at home during two four-week treatment blocks, separated by a two-week break; nine of ten have completed the protocol at time of writing. In the treatment blocks, children's utterances were evaluated either by caregivers or an automated pronunciation framework. Preliminary analysis suggests that children made significant therapy gains with Apraxia World, even though caregivers evaluated pronunciation leniently. We also collected a corpus of child speech for offline examination. We will conduct additional analysis once all participants complete the protocol.},

Our system enables designers to sketch 3D curves that can be freely posed and easily viewed from different directions; it makes sketching chained moving parts and propagating changes to different poses and perspectives effortless. We show that, with interactions closely resembling traditional 2D perspective sketching and the physical manipulation of an articulated object, designers can focus solely on ideating, iterating, and communicating multi-pose product concepts during the initial stage of design.},

This one-day workshop will explore how HCI has and might continue to engage uncertainty as a generative feature in design, as opposed to a force to mitigate and control. We hope to convene researchers from broad ranging areas to explore the many ways in which uncertainty appears in our research and the different types of responses that HCI has to offer. There is an incredible variety of conceptual formulations of uncertainty and related ideas like risk, ambiguity, and suspense that raise both difficult challenges as well as significant opportunities for creative engagement with societal challenges. During the workshop, we won't seek to "solve" uncertainty but rather expand the ways in which we think about and navigate it. In doing so, we will experiment with and contribute to new practices, methods, and concepts for embracing uncertainty. Outcomes of the workshop will include documentation of exercises designed to evoke uncertainty in participants, concept mappings, and a collection of short essays written and refined by participants.},

Research often involves participants who communicate in ways which are in line with assumed social norms and practices (e.g. those who communicate verbally), while those who communicate differently can be under-represented in design research. We highlight a need to broaden the inclusion and support of communities who have different communication needs, including; people with functional communication impairments, neurodiverse people, people who experience adverse life situations or trauma, people who are discriminated against or under-represented, and many, many other individuals and communities. We aim to unpick - and develop pragmatic solutions to - several challenges around working with diverse communities in research and practice, producing functional guidelines for design research in this area and problematising current methods and terminology.},

These findings call for an expanded research focus beyond statistical fairness to that which includes fundamental understandings of human use and the social impact of AI systems, a theme central to the HCI community. The HCI community can contribute novel understandings, methods, and techniques for incorporating human values and cultural norms into AI systems; address human biases in developing and using AI; and empower individual users and society to audit and control AI systems. Our goal is to bring together academic and industry researchers in the fields of HCI, ML and AI, and the social sciences to devise a cross-disciplinary research agenda for fair and responsible AI systems.

Self-reflection (or commonly known as analyzing past activities to operate more efficiently in the future) has been effectively used to engage participants in logging physical, behavioral, or psychological data for Quantified Self (QS) studies. This motivates us to apply self-reflection to improve the emotion self-report collection procedure. We design, develop, and deploy a self-reflection interface and augment it with a smartphone keyboard-based emotion self-report collection application. The interface provides feedback to the users regarding the relation between typing behavior and self-reported emotions. We validate the proposed approach using a between-subject study, where one group (control group) is not exposed to the self-reflection interface and the other group (study group) is exposed to it. Our initial results demonstrate that using self-reflection it is possible to engage the participants in the long-term and collect more self-reports.},

By replacing or supplementing physical face-to-face meetings, VR could also radically change how we socially interact with others. Despite this potential, the effect of transferring physical collaborative experience into a virtual one is unclear. Therefore, we investigated the experience differences between a collaborative virtual environment (CVE) and a physical environment. We used a museum visit as a task since it is a typical social experience and a promising use case for VR. 48 participants experienced the task in real and virtual environments, either alone or with a partner. Despite the potential of CVEs, we found that being in a virtual environment has adverse effects on the experience which is reinforced by being in the environment with another person. Based on quantitative and qualitative results, we provide recommendations for the design of future multi-user virtual environments.},

A two phase validation process has been conducted to assess our work. As an initial phase, we have performed a set of interviews with robotics experts. Based on these interviews we have established three main areas that our framework tackles in different time domains. In a second phase, we have developed a set of prototypes using mobile Augmented Reality that apply the principles of Kinetic AR to multiple hardware actors including an AGV, a robotic arm, and a prosthetic system.

Yet while several devices that use wind as a haptic modality have been proposed, it is difficult to precisely and quickly control the stimulation of the wind. In this study, we tackle creating an illusion of wind blowing with multiple air cannons that provides clear and low-latency tactile sensations in a specific area. Although air cannons are limited to providing short one-time stimuli, we propose a method for creating a sense of wind blowing with air cannons based on the perception of apparent tactile motion (ATM). We conducted an experiment with 12 participants to investigate the occurrence of the wind blowing sensation and the optimal parameters for it using three air cannons that were placed to hit three parts on the face. Finally, based on the results, we have exhibited a demonstration of the wind-blowing illusion with three air cannons. It created a sense that virtual objects passed in front of the participants by synchronizing with the sound source movement.},

In each structure, form factor and force feedback properties can be tuned through geometric parameters. Based on the experimental results and analysis, we implemented software to automatically generate 2D patterns for desired haptic properties. We also showcased five example applications: assistive input interfaces, rotational switch, multi-sensory toy, task checklist, and phone accessories.

Captured images are then processed by multiple state-of-the-art perception algorithms whose outputs are integrated into a real-time tracking model of all people that the system detected. Users can receive information about those people acoustically (via spatialized audio) using a wrist-worn input controller. Having such dynamic access to information, through AI system interactions, enables people with VI to: develop their communication skills; more easily focus on others; and be more confident in their social interactions.

A user study on novice practitioners (n=10, 4M/6F) showed potential in using compression/warmth stimuli to positively augment meditation and we discuss implications for future haptic meditation practices.},

Previous gesture studies under a user-centered approach have neglected the effects of visual characteristics of interface objects. To validate the effects, we collect users' multiple gesture responses through a gesture elicitation experiment for nine functions on thirteen stimuli systemically manipulated by visual properties. In the analyses, we investigate on 1) user agreements for the function-gesture mappings, and 2) differences in gesture selection in terms of the visual pattern. In the results, users respond differently in gesture selection in terms of the visual pattern-layout and number of images. This result indicates that designers should consider the visual properties of on-screen objects beyond user-elicited gestures. This study contributes toward a method for designing intuitive gestures on the touchscreen.},

Yet, there is still much to be explored in the area of accessible technologies for collaborative work. Assistive technologies are often designed for single use or single users. Interoperability between assistive technologies and computer-supported collaborative systems is essential to co-located work that inherently involves interdependencies between coworkers. The interoperability of collaborative workplace systems with assistive technologies for deaf-blind users is limited to screen readers used with refreshable braille displays [3]. How can a deaf-blind person collaborate with coworkers in real time? In this work, we explore socio-technical challenges of a work environment that depends on collaborative and assistive technologies. We observed an Information Systems and Technology (IS&amp;T) department at a University that is made up of 65 employees-one of whom is a deaf-blind programmer analyst. Through Contextual Inquiry, our observations revealed communication tensions. We present 3 Wizard of Oz prototypes to facilitate communication between the assistive technology user and the other employees in the department. We discuss the socio-technical features weaved through the prototypes. Future work is discussed.},

The themes elicited from responses indicated that digital and real components were both perceived as key characteristics, but the synthesis of these components was not significant. Responses also indicated that the public is still relatively unfamiliar with AR technologies, but familiarity does lend itself to a better understanding of what is or isn't AR. Trends in public perceptions of AR are presented, but also identify the need for more investigation into the public understanding of AR technologies.},

While the content remained the same, the versions varied by their structure (rewarding players for acting either appropriately or inappropriately) and by play perspective aesthetics (direct or indirect character embodiment). The results indicate that player preference was for the aesthetics of indirect embodiment and the goals of negative behavior. While this is perhaps unsurprising to makers of commercial games, this is contrary to typical education assessment game design. The case study also demonstrates a difference in player character embodiment that should prove useful to those determining the perspective of their player environments.},

As expected, user evaluation of the synthesized references showed a considerable loss in rating scores. We therefore computed a variety of signal-specific differences between both data types and investigated their correlations to the collected user ratings. Results reveal general statistically significant inter-dependencies of avatar movement and perception helpful for the generation of any type of virtual avatar in the future. However, results also suggest that it is difficult to determine concrete avatar features with a high influence on the user perception in the current study design.},

In pursuit of this, we have developed a VR Training simulation for a use case at Grundfos, in which apprentices learn a sequential maintenance task. We evaluated this simulation in a user study with 36 participants, comparing it to two traditional forms of training (Pairwise Training and Video Training). This case study describes the developed virtual training scenario and discusses design considerations for such VR simulations.

In this paper, we explore uncertainty as the starting point and leading principle behind digital scheduling tools. We present Haze, a speculative tool and user interface, designed to gain insights on participants’ perceptions of uncertainty-based scheduling scenarios. We report on two qualitative studies (total of 21 participants), which indicate that a change in perspective towards uncertainty can challenge moral assumptions around certainty, increase temporal empathy, and indeed support those who are particularly affected by uncertainty. These findings help shift and expand the repertoire of temporality and discuss moral and social responsibilities for design and HCI.},

Many people seek out this support through online communities, like those on Reddit. However, as these communities developed outside of existing aid groups and medical practice, it is unclear how they enable recovery. Their scale also limits researchers’ ability to engage through traditional qualitative research methods. To study these groups, we performed a topic-guided thematic analysis that used machine-generated topic models to purposively sample from two recovery subreddits: r/stopdrinking and r/OpiatesRecovery. We show that these communities provide access to an experienced and accessible support group whose discussions include consequences, reflections, and celebrations, but that also play a distinct metacommunicative role in supporting formal treatment. We discuss how these communities can act as knowledge sources to improve in-person recovery support and medical practice, and how computational techniques can enable HCI researchers to study communities at scale.},

In response, we designed a game for eliciting linguistic data following Intrinsic Elicitation – a design approach aiming to minimise validity threats in data collection games – and compared it to an equivalent linguistics experiment as control. In a preregistered study and replication (n=96 and n=136), using two different ways of operationalising accuracy, the game generated substantially more enjoyment (d=.70,.73) and substantially less accurate data (d=-.68, -.40) – though still more accurate than random responding. We conclude that for certain data types data collection games may present a serious trade-off between participant enjoyment and data quality, identify possible causes of lower data quality for future research, reflect on our design approach, and urge games HCI researchers to use careful controls where appropriate.},

To develop a broader and deepened understanding of this material and its potential for display design, we conducted a study based on a design workshop where art and design practitioners engaged in creation practice with a toolkit we designed and developed. The toolkit includes hardware components for controlling bubbles and droplets and a GUI design tool for arranging the fluid layout.

Therefore, in this paper, we contribute an evaluation (N = 18) of thumb-index pinching performance in a visual targeting task using scales up to 75 items. As part of our findings, we conclude that the pinching interaction between the thumb and index finger is a promising modality also for one-dimensional input on higher scales.

Visualizations of this data were generally preferred over purely text-based representations, and the preferred chart type for fitness bands, and smartwatches was often the same. In one in-person pilot study, and two crowdsourced studies, we then tested the effectiveness of the most preferred representations for different tasks, and found that participants performed simple tasks effectively on both form factors but more complex tasks benefited from the larger smartwatch size. Lastly, we reflect on our crowdsourced study methodology for testing the effectiveness of visualizations for wearables. Supplementary material is available at https://osf.io/yz8ar/.},

Then the probability that each observed input/output pair originates from a specific strategy is estimated along with the parameters of the corresponding likelihood distribution.

Our method works via an experiment where workers choose between a monetary bonus or a positive review. We demonstrate this method by measuring the value that freelancers assigned to positive feedback on Upwork in June 2020. The median freelancer in our sample valued a single positive review at ∼ $49 USD. We also find that less experienced freelancers valued a positive review more highly than those with more experience. Qualitative data collected during the experiment indicates that many freelancers considered issues related to reputation system-based algorithmic management while choosing between the monetary reward and the positive review.},

	abstract     = {Designers reportedly struggle with design optimization tasks where they are asked to find a combination of design parameters that maximizes a given set of objectives. In HCI, design optimization problems are often exceedingly complex, involving multiple objectives and expensive empirical evaluations. Model-based computational design algorithms assist designers by generating design examples during design, however they assume a model of the interaction domain. Black box methods for assistance, on the other hand, can work with any design problem. However, virtually all empirical studies of this human-in-the-loop approach have been carried out by either researchers or end-users. The question stands out if such methods can help designers in realistic tasks. In this paper, we study Bayesian optimization as an algorithmic method to guide the design optimization process. It operates by proposing to a designer which design candidate to try next, given previous observations. We report observations from a comparative study with 40 novice designers who were tasked to optimize a complex 3D touch interaction technique. The optimizer helped designers explore larger proportions of the design space and arrive at a better solution, however they reported lower agency and expressiveness. Designers guided by an optimizer reported lower mental effort but also felt less creative and less in charge of the progress. We conclude that human-in-the-loop optimization can support novice designers in cases where agency is not critical.},

It encodes an object’s rotation around and translation along a unique axis. Visualizations of helical axes have helped to make kinematic data tangible. However, the analysis process often remains tedious, especially if complex motions are examined. We identify multiple key challenges: the absence of interactive tools for the computation and handling of helical axes, visual clutter in axis representations, and a lack of contextualization. We solve these issues by providing the first generalized framework for kinematic analysis with helical axes. Axis sets can be computed on-demand, interactively filtered, and explored in multiple coordinated views. We iteratively developed and evaluated the HAExplorer with active biomechanics researchers. Our results show that the techniques we introduce open up the possibility to analyze non-planar, compound, and interdependent motion data.},

Although traditional search systems can help find information, they usually operate within one application (e.g., email client or web browser) and require the user’s cognitive effort and attention to formulate proper search queries. In this paper, we demonstrate EntityBot, a system that proactively provides useful and supporting entities across application boundaries without requiring explicit query formulation. Our methodology is to exploit the context from screen frames captured every 2 seconds to recommend relevant entities for the current task. Recommendations are not restricted to only documents but include various kinds of entities, such as applications, documents, contact persons, and keywords representing the tasks. Recommendations are actionable, that is, a user can perform actions on recommended entities, such as opening documents and applications. The EntityBot also includes support for interactivity, allowing the user to affect the recommendations by providing explicit feedback on the entities. The usefulness of entity recommendations and their impact on user behavior has been evaluated in a user study based on real-world tasks. Quantitative and qualitative results suggest that the system had an actual impact on the tasks and led to high user satisfaction.},

As German journalist and pacifist Kurt Tukholsky once said: “The death of one man is a tragedy, the death of millions is a statistic”. When we look back at the help-seeking posts of those who were lost, those who died of unconfirmed COVID-19 testing reports; those who committed suicide out of despair; those whose life-saving medical equipment were being taken away and those who lost their lives due to overwork and infection from their patients... Many of them were not included in the official statistics, and they are likely to be forgotten over time. They were not being treated fairly when they were alive, and they were not being mentioned after they passed away. We spoke to one of those families. One daughter said: “After this pandemic, who will remember someone such as my mother – she had nowhere to go for medical treatment; she was rejected by the hospital, and she had to die at home?” This is one of the reasons why we built this online platform. We want to document as many people who have left us because of the pandemic as possible. Our website also includes the help-seeking information these people posted before they passed away. These are the evidences they have left in a particular moment in this pandemic. We hope to provide a space for family members to express their grief and for the public to mourn the dead.

However, in order to incorporate paper-based annotations into digital workflows, handwritten text and markings need to be extracted. Common computer-vision and machine-learning approaches require extensive sets of training data or a clean digital version of the document. We propose a simple method for extracting handwritten annotations from laser-printed documents using multispectral imaging. While black toner absorbs infrared light, most inks are invisible in the infrared spectrum. We modified an off-the-shelf flatbed scanner by adding a switchable infrared LED to its light guide. By subtracting an infrared scan from a color scan, handwritten text and highlighting can be extracted and added to a PDF version. Initial experiments show accurate results with high quality on a test data set of 93 annotated pages. Thus, infrared scanning seems like a promising building block for integrating paper-based and digital annotation practices.},

	abstract     = {Selfies have become a prominent means of online communication. Group selfies, in particular, encourage people to represent their identity as part of the group and foster a sense of belonging. During the COVID-19 pandemic, video conferencing systems are used as a tool for group selfies. However, conventional systems are not ideal for group selfies due to the rigidness of grid-based layout, information overload, and lack of eye contact. To explore design opportunities and needs for a novel virtual group selfie platform, we conducted a participatory design, and identified three characteristics of virtual group selfie scenarios, “context with narratives”, “interactive group tasks”, and “capturing subtle moments.” We implemented Virfie, a web-based platform that enables users to take group selfies with embodied social interaction, and to create and customize selfie scenarios using a novel JSON specification. In order to validate our design concept and identify usability issues we conducted a user study. Feedbacks from the study participants suggest that Virfie is effective at strengthening social interaction and remote togetherness.},

Based on these insights we designed two AR interventions: AR Exergame, an interactive game that requires the user to move their hands to grab virtual apples; AR micro-movements, a method that requires the user to switch to a different physical space when starting a new virtual class. These AR interventions were aimed at encouraging students to perform micro-activities in between virtual classes, i.e. small non-strenuous activities. The effectiveness of these methods to reduce video conferencing fatigue, a.k.a Zoom fatigue, and also to compare it with the students current methods was tested through a user study with six participants.},

One of these devices’ most-used navigation methods is the turn-by-turn method, first used in car-based navigation systems. However, pedestrians and cyclists increasingly use other methods such as the as-the-crow-flies (ATCF) navigation method instead of the classical turn-by-turn navigation. Instead of giving fixed instruction, ATCF navigation only indicates the straight-line direction to the destination and users have to make their own decision when and where to turn. In this paper, we improve the route predictions for such alternative navigation methods as ATFC by incorporating a model on users’ angle estimation error. We show that the route predictions are closer to actual human navigation behavior than methods proposed in related work.},

The majority of these results either originate from controlled laboratory studies, or protocols relying on subjective self-reporting, reducing their ecological validity. This paper presents results from a full day in situ study investigating the impact of perceiving one’s smartphone notifications on wrist motion patterns. Through this objective behavioral assessment, we document for the first time the manifestations of notification-induced disruption outside of the lab, independently of user activity and without the need for self-reporting. We identified a decrease in wrist motion activity following the presentation of a notification while the participant was engaged in higher intensity activities, independently of whether the notification is immediately attended to. These findings provide objective support for the claim that notifications have as much potential for disruption when merely perceived as they do when the user actually responds to them.},

AcousticType employs four modules: Noise Cancelling, Keystroke Detection, Key Identification and Word Correction. Our results show AcousticType recovers up to 98% of the typed text. We also showed that utilizing the noise cancellation, AcousticType is robust to the changes in the environment, which further boosts the practicality. The findings are promising and call for further investigation into new types of text entry methods that utilize acoustic signals to cope with the usability issues in smart devices.},

Our implementation of TVC includes three different comparison modes, namely SideBySide, Overlay, and Differences. Furthermore, we discuss the anticipated use, opportunities, and challenges of using TVC in the future for individual users as well as for asynchronous collaborative work.},

User motives may play a role as well, with those who use VAs primarily for information resenting ads more than those who see their VAs as social companions. To test such propositions, we conducted a scenario-based user study (N = 264) in which Siri acted as either a source of ads or as a medium for delivering ads by a human spokesperson. Findings suggest that for informationally motivated users, Siri as ad source causes reactance via lowered sense of control over the interaction. On the other hand, for those with social motives, it increases social presence and positively affects user experience of the interaction.},

We had three levels for a between-subjects factor in a mixed design study, where we provided participants with: no wage information, wage point estimate, and wage distribution. Each participant had three stages of adjusting the reward and controlling the estimated wage. Our analysis with Bayesian growth curve modeling suggests that the estimated wage derived from the participant-set reward increased from $2.56/h to $2.69/h and $2.33/h to $2.74/h when we provided point estimate and distribution information respectively.

Given text-based communication being the main channel for virtual collaboration, we propose a novel solution leveraging an AI-based, dynamic affective recognition system. The app provides live feedback about the affective content of the communication in Slack, in the form of a visual representation and percentage breakdown of the ‘sentiment’ (tone, emoji) and main ‘emotion states’ (e.g. joy, anger). We tested the usability of the app in a quasi-experiment with 30 participants from diverse backgrounds, linguistic analysis and user interviews. The findings show that the app significantly increases shared understanding and creativity within virtual teams. Emerged themes included impression formation assisted by affective recognition, supporting long-term relationships development; identified challenges related to transparency and emotional complexity detected by AI.},

We interviewed 10 older adults living in an assisted living community in the U.S. to explore their values around AI for health. Findings show that they value technologies that generate and share positive and relational health information. We use this emphasis on positive health representations to speculate on a critical refusal of negative health representations. We highlight this preference in contrast to existing deficit-based health tracking technologies for aging and discuss how researchers, developers, and designers can engage in better approaches to AI-driven health for older adults and other historically marginalized populations.},

In this paper, we argue that crowdworking platforms sell temporal flexibility to requesters to the detriment of workers. We begin by identifying a list of 19 features employed by crowdworking platforms that facilitate the trade of temporal flexibility from crowdworkers to requesters. Using the list of features, we conduct a comparative analysis of nine crowdworking platforms available to U.S.-based workers, in which we describe key differences and similarities between the platforms. We find that crowdworking platforms strongly favour features that promote requesters’ temporal flexibility over workers’ by limiting the predictability of workers’ working hours and restricting paid time. Further, we identify which platforms employ the highest number of features that facilitate the trade of temporal flexibility from workers to requesters, consequently increasing workers’ temporal precarity. We conclude the paper by discussing the implications of the results.},

Second, we collected N = 800 user descriptions of virtual indoor locations from N = 80 Amazon Mechanical Turk participants to analyze user language. We explored the effects of conversational agent behavior and observed that people describe indoor locations differently based on how the agent presents itself. We devise “Entity Suitability Scale,” a concrete and scalable approach to obtain information to support localization from the myriad of indoor entities users mention in their descriptions. Through this study, we lay foundation to our proposed paradigm of conversational localization.},

Therefore, a negative impact on adolescent emotional development is predicted. To solve this problem, we design a narrative-based game Evoker that uses real-time facial expression recognition. In this game, players are asked to identify an emotion from narrative contexts in missions, and make a facial expression appropriate for the context to clear the challenges. Our game provides an opportunity to practice reading emotional contexts and expressing appropriate emotions, which has a high potential for promoting emotional development of adolescents.},

	abstract     = {Online courses are popular among learners of programming, but many learners have trouble completing the courses. A common approach to increase learner engagement is to provide co-learner presence via chat and forums. In this work, we present Cocode, an online learning system where learners can share their presence without any explicit action; their normal learning activities would signal co-learner presence. Cocode is a web application for online programming courses that shows other learners' code editors and running screens in the programming environment to the learners while working on exercises. Results from our between-subject studies show that learners with Cocode are more engaged and work on more programming exercises compared to the learners using the system without social features.},

Our findings reveal that although co-editing questions is perceived as a positive and effective approach for improving questions' answerability and shaping norms in the online community, effective moderation mechanisms need to be designed to improve transparency and communication about co-editing behavior and to address possible tensions as a result of co-editing wars.},

The mechanisms for such 'feeling' are not entirely clear: observing from outside VR, one can see that there is nothing physical for participants to 'feel'. Here we outline exploratory user studies designed to evaluate the extent to which participants can distinguish quantitative differences in the flexibility of VR-simulated molecular objects. The results suggest that an individual's capacity to detect differences in molecular flexibility is enhanced when they can interact with and manipulate the molecules, as opposed to merely observing the same interaction. Building on these results, we intend to carry out further studies investigating humans' ability to sense quantitative properties of VR simulations without haptic technology.},

On the other hand, a more holistic understanding of when and why users would like devices and features to be smart is missing as of today. Such knowledge is valuable for researchers and practitioners to inform the design of future smart home devices and features, in particular with regards to interaction techniques, privacy mechanisms, and, ultimately, acceptance and uptake. We found that users would appreciate smart features for various use cases, including remote control and multi-tasking, and are willing to share devices.

Recent works highlight limitations to this assumption which make drivers rely less on given directions. To explore how drivers can make better navigation decisions, we conducted a pilot Wizard-of-Oz study that gives turn suggestions in conversations between two voice agents. We asked 30 participants to drive in a simulation environment using voice guidance that gives three types of suggestions: familiar, optimal, and new routes. We examined their route choices, perceived workload and utterances while driving. We found that while most drivers followed directions appropriate for the given scenarios, they were more likely to make inappropriate choices after hearing alternatives in conversations. On the other hand, two-party conversations allowed drivers to better reflect on their choices after trips. We conclude by discussing preliminary design implications for car navigation voice guidance specifically and recommender systems in general.},

Although modern medicine alleviates the physical symptoms of chronic pain, it fails to address issues that feast on the sufferer's mental health. Moreover, awareness, acceptance and empathy towards the sufferers are lacking in the society. On the other side is an interactive narrative that employs gameplay as a medium to induce empathy and awareness about social stigmatization and isolation that patients with chronic pain conditions face.

However, the CHI conference receives submissions with varying levels of transparency and oftentimes, papers that are more transparent can be inadvertently subjected to more scrutiny in the review process, raising issues of fairness. In this panel, we bring together researchers with diverse qualitative work experiences to present examples of transparency-related initiatives and their corresponding review responses. We aim to work towards setting standards for transparent reporting in qualitative-work submissions and increasing fairness in the review process. We focus on the challenges in achieving transparency in qualitative research and current workarounds to overcome frictions in the reviewing process through engaging discussions involving panelists and the audience.},

Most earlier teleoperated robot systems informed the customers that the robots are being remotely controlled, while the customers believed that they were communicating with the operators through the robots. However, it has already been shown that there are some disadvantages in informing customers about the robot teleoperation. To investigate whether customers could accept and use teleoperated robots that acted as if they were autonomous, we developed a teleoperated system in which operators represent autonomous robots. Our system was experimentally tested by employing operators that provided services to customers in a real field. It was found that many customers were particularly satisfied with the service of the teleoperated robots that behaved as if they were autonomous, while we demonstrated that customers who did not realize the robot teleoperation rated the service higher than the customers who realized the same.},

However, to date, there are few research efforts that explicitly focus on these overlapping themes (automated driving &amp; climate changes) within the HCI and AutomotiveUI communities. Our intention is to grow this community and awareness of the related problems. Specifically, in this workshop, we invite designers, researchers, and practitioners from the sustainable HCI, persuasive design, AutomotiveUI, and mobility communities to collaborate in finding ways to make future mobility more sustainable. Using embodied design improvisation and design fiction methods, we will explore the ways that systems affect behavior which then affect the environment.},

However, in subsequent decades the initial tight connection between the fields has become less pronounced. The recent rise of deep learning has revolutionized AI and has led to a raft of practical methods and tools that significantly impact areas outside of core-AI. In particular, modern AI techniques now power new ways for machines and humans to interact. Thus it is timely to investigate how modern AI can propel HCI research in new ways and how HCI research can help direct AI developments. This workshop offers a forum for researchers to discuss new opportunities that lie in bringing modern AI methods into HCI research, identifying important problems to investigate, showcasing computational and scientific methods that can be applied, and sharing datasets and tools that are already available or proposing those that should be further developed. The topics we are interested in including deep learning methods for understanding and modeling human behaviors and enabling new interaction modalities, hybrid intelligence that combine human and machine intelligence to solve difficult tasks, and tools and methods for interaction data curation and large-scale data-driven design. At the core of these topics, we want to start the conversation on how data-driven and data-centric approaches of modern AI can impact HCI.},

We are particularly vulnerable in domains such as medical diagnosis, criminal justice, seniors care, driving, and warfare. Here AI applications have begun or are imminent. Yet much current AIs are unreliable and inconsistent, without common sense; deceptive in hiding that they are algorithms and not people; mute and unable to explain decisions and actions; unfair and unjust; free from accountability and responsibility; and used but not trusted. Happily, we are not helpless victims of forces totally outside our control. We can raise our voices as citizens; we can enact procedures and legislation as a society.

However, recent research has revealed a prevalence of persuasive designs and tracking of children's data in these apps, which may harm children's online privacy and self-regulation development. We conducted 20 interviews with Android family app developers to understand their design practices. We used the lens of Value Sensitive Design to identify developer's values and how they translate them into design choices. Our findings show that though developer values are generally aligned with the best interest of users, they often must make compromises due to market pressure, lack of monetisation options, and the use of biased design guidelines. Our findings show a need for centralised actionable guidelines and important directions for HCI research to support both end-users' and developers' values.},

This shortage is especially pronounced in the domain of electronics, where the materials are historically visually-rendered and complex. To address this, we took a qualitative approach to designing and evaluating tactile graphics and textual descriptions when building circuits. To gain an understanding of their efficacy, we provided a circuit description [3], component diagrams (Figure 4), and a tactile schematic [9] as educational materials in a Blind Arduino workshop with eight participants and interviewed these participants about their experience. Our research revealed the complexities of designing these materials: our tactile component diagrams were usable and helpful, whereas our tactile schematics and circuit descriptions presented learning barriers in a microcontroller workshop. We provide recommendations for future research to design accessible materials to teach electronics.},

Current tools have predominately focused on tracking food intake, such as carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and calories. Other factors, such as contextual information and momentary thoughts and feelings that are internal to an individual, are also essential to help people reflect upon and change attitudes about eating behaviors. However, current dietary tracking tools rarely support capturing these elements as a way to foster deep reflection. In this work, we present Eat4Thought - a food journaling application that allows users to track their emotional, sensory, and spatio-temporal elements of meals as a means of supporting self-reflection. The application enables vivid documentation of experiences and self-reflection on the past through video recording. We describe our design process and an initial evaluation of the application.

For simplicity, instead of general text input a small set of answer options are often provided, but these are limited and impersonal. In contrast, free-form drawings can answer messages in a very personal way, but are difficult to produce on small displays. To enable precise drawing input on smartwatches we present a magnetic stylus that is tracked on the back of the hand. In an evaluation of several algorithms we show that 3D position estimation with a 7.5x20mm magnet reaches a worst-case 6% relative position error on the back of the hand. Furthermore, the results of a user study are presented, which show that in the case of drawing applications the presented technique is faster and more precise than direct finger input.},

Losing the memories of meaningful social activities, such as visits from family, can be confronting not only for the person with dementia, but also for relatives and caretakers. Through an iterative design process involving people with dementia, caretakers and relatives, the RelivRing concept was developed. The RelivRing enables people with dementia to relive the positive experience of visits from relatives. It allows relatives to leave audio messages of their visits, which the person with dementia might have otherwise forgotten. When listening to these messages, the person with dementia can re-experience the positive feeling of the visit. The design is adapted to a person with dementia's cognitive and perceptual abilities following literature research and in-context user studies. With the RelivRing, we aim to maintain and strengthen existing social relations between people with dementia and their relatives.},

When applied to the tongue with no voltage, the user can taste all five tastes. However, when an electric potential is applied, the cations in the gel move to the cathode side and away from the tongue, so that the flavor is tasted weakly. In this way, we have developed a taste display that reproduces an arbitrary taste by individually suppressing the sensation of each of the five basic tastes (like subtractive synthesis.) Our study differs from previous work in that it uses an electric current for electrophoresis rather than electrically stimulating the tongue, and it does not involve ingestion of a solution to deliver the taste.},

To overcome these deficiencies, we are developing Massif, an interactive tool for deciphering adversarial attacks. Massif identifies and interactively visualizes neurons and their connections inside a DNN that are strongly activated or suppressed by an adversarial attack. Massif provides both a high-level, interpretable overview of the effect of an attack on a DNN, and a low-level, detailed description of the affected neurons. Massif's tightly coupled views help people better understand which input features are most vulnerable and important for correct predictions.},

Early intervention can have significant positive impact on a person's prognosis, particularly important in improving mental health outcomes and functioning for young people. Virtual Reality (VR) in mental health is an emerging and innovative field. Recent studies support the use of VR technology in the treatment of anxiety, phobia, eating disorders, addiction, and pain management. However, there is little research on using VR for supporting, treatment and prevention of depression - a field that is very much emerging. There is also very little work done in offering individualised VR experience to users with mental health issues. This paper proposes iVR, a novel individualised VR for improving users' self-compassion, and in the long run, their positive mental health. We describe the concept, design, architecture and implementation of iVR and outline future work. We believe this contribution will pave the way for large-scale efficacy testing, clinical use, and potentially cost-effective delivery of VR technology for mental health therapy in future.},

To address this gap, this paper presents the initial results of a descriptive review of 38 peer-reviewed papers on this topic. Qualitative analysis revealed four opportunity themes where interactive technologies appear to provide unique benefits. The analysis also revealed three challenge themes where design guidance, particularly around emotion representation, is ambiguous or underspecified.

Three variables were measured, the number of control checks during AD and non-driving related tasks (NDRT), the reaction time to resume manual control and the strategy used to recover control. Differences were found concerning road monitoring during NDRT, there are more interruptions in the WOz condition than in the DS condition. Additionally, the strategies used to recover control were different between conditions, the steering wheel and brake pedal were used more often in the WOz condition while the accelerator was used more often in the DS condition.

We introduce the EMI platform - an expressive, mobile and interactive robot - consisting of a circular diff-drive robot base equipped with a rear-projected expressive face, and omni-directional microphone for voice-interaction. We exhibited the EMI robot at a public event, in which attendees were given the option to interact with the robot and participate in a survey and observational study. The survey and observations focused on the effects of the robot's expressiveness in interactions with users of different ages and cultural backgrounds. From the survey responses, video observations and informal interviews we highlight key design decisions in EMI that resulted in positive user reactions.},

The system is embedded in between soft deformable layers, such as textiles or rubbers. The result is a soft sensate surface that can be distributed and conformally wrap and adapt to curved structures. Each node contains a microprocessor together with a collection of nine sensors and a light-emitting diode, providing multimodal data that can be used to detect various deformation, proxemic, tactile, and environmental changes. We show that the electronic skin can sense and respond to a variety of stimuli simultaneously, as well as open up a possibility for sensor-rich virtual and augmented reality-based visualization and interaction.},

Prior work has proved the value of depicting teachers' whereabouts. Yet a major opportunity remains in the design of new, synthesized visualizations that help researchers and practitioners to gain more insights in the vast tracking data. We present Dandelion Diagram, a synthesized heatmap technique that combines both teachers' positioning and orientation (heading) data, and affords richer representations in addition to whereabouts-For example, teachers' attention pattern (which directions they were attending to), and their mobility pattern (i.e., trajectories in the classroom). Utilizing various classroom data from a field study, this paper illustrates the design and utility of Dandelion Diagram.},

Therefore, when users shake the ElastOscillation device, the proxy shakes or moves in the corresponding movement ranges or levels. The users then perceive the force from oscillation in different levels. In addition, elastic force from the bands further reinforces the oscillation force feedback. In the demonstration, users can explore four VR applications that feel the sensation of pan-flipping, bartender-shaking, wine-swirling and fishing.},

To support our analysis, we (i) video recorded sessions, (ii) tracked users' interactions, and (iii) collected data of participants' impressions. Our prototype confirms that agile SV is feasible. That is, liveness boosted participants' engagement when programming an SV, and so, the sessions were highly interactive and participants were willing to spend much time using our toolkit (i.e., median ≥ 1.5 hours). Participants used our integrated toolkit to deal with data transformations, visual mappings, and view transformations without leaving the immersive environment. Finally, participants benefited from our expressive toolkit and employed multiple of the available features when programming an SV.},

Much like visual user interface design, conversation design benefits from prototyping and user testing to allow for conversation exploration and improvement. However, it can be overwhelming to quickly iterate on the conversation design as the iterative process requires not only designing a conversation but also building and testing a working chatbot equipped with the conversation. We developed ProtoChat, a prototype system that supports an iterative conversation design by allowing designers to (1) prototype conversations, (2) test the conversations with the crowd, and (3) review and analyze the crowdsourced conversation data. Results of an exploratory study with four conversation designers show that the designers successfully iterated on their conversation design by reviewing how the crowd followed the conversation, which provided insights into concrete action items for improving their conversation design.},

Existing studies detect and quantify biases based on pre-defined attributes. However, in real practices, it is difficult to gather a comprehensive list of sensitive concepts for various categories of biases. We propose a general methodology to quantify dataset biases by measuring the difference of its data distribution with a reference dataset using Maximum Mean Discrepancy. For the case of natural language data, we show that lexicon-based features quantify explicit stereotypes, while deep learning-based features further capture implicit stereotypes represented by complex semantics. Our method provides a more flexible way to detect potential biases.},

In this work, we propose a portable low-fidelity solution for text input in mixed reality on a physical keyboard that employs accessible off-the-shelf components. Through a user study with 24 participants, we show that our prototype leads to a significantly higher text input performance compared to soft keyboards. However, it falls behind on copy editing compared to soft keyboards. Qualitative inquiries revealed that participants enjoyed the ample display space and perceived the accompanied privacy as beneficial. Finally, we conclude with challenges and future research that builds upon the presented findings.},

Taken the results of explorative factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis together, we suggested a four-factor model: symbolic, instrumental, affective-self, and affective-other motives. We found that ICV users with different characteristics in age, annual income and driving distance evaluated the importance of motives differently. ICV users who are richer and drive longer distances are more likely to show higher symbolic and affective-self motives. Also, users' symbolic motive grows with age. Finally, we found that symbolic and affective motives correlated highly with social norms and loyalty, while instrumental motives related to perceived control feelings toward operating the vehicle. These findings shed novel insights on how to design ICVs and make related policies.},

Research has already addressed the missing communication possibilities when no human driver is needed. However, there is no common evaluation standard for the proposed external communication concept with respect to the complexity of the traffic system. We have therefore investigated the evaluation of these in Virtual Reality, in monitor-based, and in prototypical setups with special regard to scalability. We found that simulated traffic noise is a non-factor in current evaluations and that involving multiple people and multiple lanes with numerous vehicles is scarce.},

We present the concept of Gridlets, an abstraction over calculation and presentation applicable in common use case scenarios. Using the Cognitive Dimensions of Notations framework, we compare Gridlets to copy/paste and sheet-defined functions. We find that Gridlets are consistent with the spreadsheet paradigm, enable users to take advantage of secondary notation, and make common edit operations less viscous and less error-prone.},

	abstract     = {Elastic Legs Illusion (ELI) provides the striking illusory experience of having a longer legs where the virtual legs are visually stretched from the first-person perspective. This illusion works without any experimenter's assist; a single subject wearing a HMD sits on a floor with both legs stretched straight out against a wooden-plate and pulls backward a handle connected with rubber-material tube, that is anchored at the plate. A weight scale (Wii Balance Board) is placed sandwiched between the both legs and the plate where the more strongly the subject pulls the handle the more load is transferred to both legs as well as to the weight scale. ELI correlates this increment of the weight scale with the stretch ratio of the legs in HMD space. Thus, the sense of legs being pushed back against the plate is transformed into a sense of having longer legs. The system was tested in our laboratory exhibition, showing 33 out of 44 participants agreed with having longer legs strongly.},

Given teenagers' growing reluctance toward face-to-face communication, using a counseling chatbot could be a more effective way to provide teenage victims with necessary information and emotional support. There is a small number of counseling chatbots for victims of sexual crime, but none targeting teenagers specifically. This research suggests design guidelines for building a counseling chatbot for teenage victims of online sexual exploitation with a focus on establishing rapport by empathizing with their stories and providing them with the proper information. We conducted in-depth interviews with peer counselors at the Teenage Women's Human Rights Center, who have been consulting teenage victims in their age group using online messengers. The four key findings from our research suggested using open-ended questions, using teenager-friendly language, helping teenagers understand that they are victims and offering age-relevant information.},

With my work, I explore what I call pap: 3D-printed interactive objects without requiring any post-print activities such as assembly or calibration. I approach this by by externally sensing how the user's actions interact with well-studied physical phenomena (e.g., acoustic resonance and fluid dynamics). I have developed two novel techniques using this principle: , a blow-based interaction technique for fabricated objects using acoustic resonance; and , a technique for fabricating touch-sensitive objects using pneumatic sensing and fluid dynamics principles.},

	abstract     = {I have long been interested in how people seek information from external sources and make sense of the results. While the sources of information have continued to evolve over the years from libraries, to web search engines, to virtual assistants, many important challenges and opportunities remain. The success of any information retrieval systems depends critically on both the ability to support people in articulating their information needs and making sense of the results to solve the problem that motivated their search in the first place, as well as the need to efficiently and effectively find relevant information. My research combines these two dimensions into an interdisciplinary, user-centered perspective on information systems.My interest in information retrieval started in the early 1980's with the observation that different people use a surprisingly wide variety of words to describe the same object or concept. This fundamental characteristic of human language set limits on how well simple word-matching techniques can do in satisfying information needs. In a paper at the pre-CHI Gaithersburg conference in 1982 [6] we describe this problem as statistical semantics. (It is symptomatic of the problem that we subsequently used vocabulary mismatch, verbal disagreement, and statistical semantics to refer to the same problem.) Over the next decade, with colleagues at Bell Labs, I developed and evaluated solutions that involved collecting multiple descriptors for objects, and reducing the dimensionality of the representation using techniques like Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) [3][7] to mitigate the disagreement between the vocabulary that authors use in writing and searchers use to express their information needs. Similar approaches (combined with a lot more data and compute) are used to power modern word-embedding techniques that widely used in natural language processing.},

We then introduce Press'Em, a 3D-printed prototype capable of simulating button tactility based on FDVV models. To drive Press'Em, an end-to-end simulation pipeline is presented that covers (1) capturing any physical buttons, (2) controlling the actuation signals, and (3) simulating the tactility. Our system can go beyond replicating existing buttons to enable designers to emulate and test non-existent ones with desired haptic properties. Press'Em aims to be a tool for future research to better understand and iterate over button designs.},

However, few TUI projects take the lens of active language use, and exploit the benefits of tangibles for maintaining and revitalising endangered languages. We present the Crocodile Language Friend, co-designed with the Wujal Wujal community, to foster children's use of the Kuku Yalanji Aboriginal language. We contribute a discussion of the ways in which the crocodile's physical characteristics (e.g. size, shape, materials, and personalization) can encourage language use in individual and social activities beyond the affordances of screen-based systems.},

Though the instruction of the golf-swing has been conducted to the beginners by the instructor or the consumer device specialized in the golf-swing training, it was difficult to modify the posture of golf-club during the swing. This is because the users require time to understand and express the instruction. Also, these instructions cannot convey detailed information to the users. Therefore, we propose a golf club type device mounting ungrounded force feedback module to modify the posture of golf-club during the golf-swing. In this paper, we implemented a prototype of the proposed device and the application using the device. The prototype was evaluated its performance and the results suggested the prototype generate sufficient torque to move the golf-club grasped by the user.},

To understand the design space of CoSeq, we ran a formative study to observe how participants utilize visualizations to strategically reduce their cognitive burden.

In this paper, we investigate two gesture modalities, surface and motion, for operating mobile AR applications. In order to identify optimal gestures for various interactions, we conducted an elicitation study with 21 participants for 12 tasks, which yielded a total of 504 gestures. We classified and illustrated the two sets of gestures, and compared them in terms of goodness, ease of use, and engagement. The elicitation process yielded two separate sets of user-defined gestures; legacy surface gestures, which were familiar and easy to use by the participants, and motion gestures, which had better engagement. From the interaction patterns of this second set of gestures, we propose a new interaction class called TMR (Touch-Move-Release), which defines for mobile AR.},

We tested the accessibility of virtual reality (VR) as a modality for training PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) employees, and we observed negative and positive sentiments associated with various approaches to VR engagement. This case study presents our efforts to improve VR headset onboarding and game play experience by analyzing user experience from the time they show up for the VR learning experience to the time they leave. We describe learner capabilities and skills required to interact with the headset and voice-recognition technology in a simulation based learning experience, the methods we used to identify user sentiments and infer causes, as well as our efforts to address user needs by adjusting our VR learner experience design. In selecting our test user population, we attempted to represent the diversity of PwC learner demographics, including gender, ethnicity, employee role / function, practice group within PwC, and other characteristics that could have had a material impact on VR equipment use, such as prior experience with VR, use of eyeglasses, and presence of various accents when speaking. Our heterogenous group of testers pushed us to acknowledge user sensitivities, which we had previously underestimated. We changed our VR onboarding protocol in order to mitigate reticence to learning in VR. We believe that as the technology becomes more prevalent in the enterprise and more employees experience the value VR brings to the training experience, the overall sentiment toward VR will continue to improve. We hope our study motivates continued research to improve accessibility of VR technology, enterprise implementation of VR, user-interface design, and voice recognition technologies used in gameplay.},

The digital switch has come with many benefits such as lowering barriers, mobile work environments and mass production for distribution of work. Along with these benefits we also see challenges for art and design work and its future perception in society. As technology takes a more significant role in supporting art and design what will this mean for the individual artist or designer? The focus of this workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners to explore what the future of digital art and design will hold. The exploration will centre around synthesizing key challenges and questions, along with ideas for future interaction technologies that consider mobile and tangible aspects of digital art.},

With this in mind, the purpose of our workshop is as follows. First, to provide a platform for researchers and practitioners to engage with these issues that often remain hidden when discussions solely focus on technology.

Biometric authentication methods promise to fulfill both aspects to a high degree, yet they come with severe drawbacks, such as the lack of changeability of the utilized trait, in case it is leaked or stolen. To compensate for these disadvantages, we introduce a novel class of biometric authentication systems in this work, named "Functional Biometrics". This approach regards the human body as a function that transforms a stimulus which is applied to the body by the authentication system. Both, the stimulus and the measured body reflection form a pair that can subsequently be used for authentication, yet the underlying function remains secret. Following this approach, we intend to disprove some of the drawbacks of traditional biometrics.},

They used a suite of mobile applications to set up their study goals, track their study and distraction time, and share their goals with other group members for 2 weeks. Results suggest that the 5-people groups had achieved better outcomes than the 2-people groups considering less fluctuation and more deduction in average distraction rate (distraction time divided by study time). We conclude by proposing several design implications concerning the design of mobile applications to reduce academic procrastination, and identify several future research directions on this topic.},

Studying users' reactions to inferences made about them, especially what surprises them, allows us to better understand this gap. We interviewed users of Google and Facebook to learn their current beliefs and expectations about how these platforms use their data to make inferences, and identified four common sources of surprise for participants: irrelevant inferences, outdated inferences, inferences with no connection to online activity, and inferences related to friends or family.

Designing scatterplots for large data sets is challenging, as overlapping markers are likely to cause loss of information. Poorly chosen marker opacity, shape, or size may lead to e.g. overplotting or diminished visibility of outliers. The challenge is amplified by having to wait for rendering every time the design is changed. To reduce designer effort, optimisation-based approaches to scatterplot design have been proposed, most comprehensive being an algorithm by Micallef et al. (2017) that applies image-based perceptual quality measures to automatic evaluation of scatterplots. However, their approach suffers also from poor rendering performance, discouraging usage in interactive applications. This paper presents an algorithm applying abstract rendering for efficiently updating scatterplot markers regardless of data set size. We show how our approach enables fast, interactive design and adjustment of overlap in scatterplots, demonstrated with a proof-of-concept visualisation tool.},

Additionally, it is a valuable method of ideation and communication for both subjective and group-based projects. We propose further integration of sketching practice within HCI and computer science curricula, both to preserve this valuable skill for use in research and industry, and to widen the perspectives of those working with subjects often seen as grounded in code or logic. SketCHI #3 will bring together those interested in enhancing student's and colleagues experience in a hands-on meeting of minds and sketching, with the aim to share best practice and knowledge for those interested in expanding our views on education in the field, and to co-create a Sketching in HCI education plan with a body of knowledge.},

However, it is difficult to improve the performance of recognizing cross-subject emotion due to subjectivity and the noise associated with EEG data collection. In this paper, we propose a novel cross-subject EEG-based emotion recognition method with combination of channel-wise features and LSTM. The channel-wise feature is defined by the symmetric matrix, the element of which is calculated by the Pearson correlation coefficient between two-pair channels to consider the spatial interaction among all channels. Then, the channel-wise features are fed to the 2-layer stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), which can extract temporal features and learns an emotional model that can complementarily handle subjectivity and noise. The experiments on two publicly available datasets DEAP and SEED demonstrate the effectiveness of the combined use of channel-wise features and LSTM. Experimental results achieve state-of-the-art classification rate of 98.93% and 99.10% over 2-classes valence and arousal on DEAP respectively and show the accuracy of 99.63% over 3-classes classification on SEED.},

In a series of studies, we manipulated AI systems' warmth and competence levels. We show that, similar to the judgments of other people, there is often primacy for warmth over competence. Specifically, when faced with a choice between a high-competence system and a high-warmth system, more participants preferred the high-warmth system. Moreover, the precedence of warmth persisted even when the high-warmth system was overtly deficient in its competence compared to an alternative high competence-low warmth system. The current research proposes that it may be vital for AI systems designers to consider and communicate the system's warmth characteristics to its potential users.},

Ideators can be directed towards diverse prompts and away from prior ideas, thus improving their collective creativity. Since there are diverse metrics of diversity, we present a Diversity Prompting Evaluation Framework consolidating metrics from several research disciplines to analyze along the ideation chain — prompt selection, prompt creativity, prompt-ideation mediation, and ideation creativity. Using this framework, we evaluated Directed Diversity in a series of a simulation study and four user studies for the use case of crowdsourcing motivational messages to encourage physical activity. We show that automated diverse prompting can variously improve collective creativity across many nuanced metrics of diversity.},

This paper introduces a flexible and efficient alternative approach for constructing hand gestures. We present Gesture Knitter: a design tool for creating custom gesture recognizers with minimal training data. Gesture Knitter allows the specification of gesture primitives that can then be combined to create more complex gestures using a visual declarative script. Designers can build custom recognizers by declaring them from scratch or by providing a demonstration that is automatically decoded into its primitive components. Our developer study shows that Gesture Knitter achieves high recognition accuracy despite minimal training data and delivers an expressive and creative design experience.},

Our mixed-methods approach combined environment logging, observations, and semi-structured interviews. The results demonstrate how small and large spaces influenced group formation, shared attention, and personal space, where smaller rooms facilitated more cohesive groups while larger rooms made small group formation challenging but personal space more flexible. Beyond our findings, we show how the combination of data and insights can fuel collaborative spaces’ design and deliver more effective virtual workshops.},

PCOS causes different symptoms for different people, with no singular or universal cure. Being a stigmatized and enigmatic condition, it is challenging to discover, diagnose, and manage PCOS. This work aims to inform the design of inclusive health technologies through an understanding of people’s lived experiences and challenges with PCOS. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 10 women diagnosed with PCOS and analyzed a PCOS-specific subreddit forum. We report people’s support-seeking, sense-making, and self-experimentation practices, and find uncertainty and stigma to be key in shaping their unique experiences of the condition. We further identify potential avenues for designing technology to support their diverse needs, such as personalized and contextual tracking, accelerated self-discovery, and co-management, contributing to a growing body of HCI literature on stigmatized topics in women’s health and well-being.},

By using rows and columns of electrodes, specialized touch controllers are able to capture a 2D image of capacitance at the surface of a screen. For over a decade, capacitive “pixels” have been around 4 millimeters in size – a surprisingly low resolution that precludes a wide range of interesting applications. In this paper, we show how super-resolution techniques, long used in fields such as biology and astronomy, can be applied to capacitive touchscreen data. By integrating data from many frames, our software-only process is able to resolve geometric details finer than the original sensor resolution. This opens the door to passive tangibles with higher-density fiducials and also recognition of every-day metal objects, such as keys and coins. We built several applications to illustrate the potential of our approach and report the findings of a multipart evaluation.},

Radi-Eye provides widgets for discrete and continuous input and scales to support larger feature sets. Widgets can be selected with Look &amp; Cross, using gaze for pre-selection followed by head-crossing as trigger and for manipulation. The technique leverages natural eye-head coordination where eye and head move at an offset unless explicitly brought into alignment, enabling interaction without risk of unintended input. We explore Radi-Eye in three augmented and virtual reality applications, and evaluate the effect of radial interface scale and orientation on performance with Look &amp; Cross.

However, evaluating if and how an interactive technology helps a user reflect is still complex. This makes it difficult to compare artefacts (or prototypes) for reflection, impeding future design efforts. To address this issue, we developed the Technology-Supported Reflection Inventory (TSRI), which is a scale that evaluates how effectively a system supports reflection. We first created a list of possible scale items based on past work in defining reflection. The items were then reviewed by experts. Next, we performed exploratory factor analysis to reduce the scale to its final length of nine items. Subsequently, we confirmed test-retest validity of our instrument, as well as its construct validity. The TSRI enables researchers and practitioners to compare prototypes designed to support reflection.},

Thus, the advent of AISCs begs a question of whether and how they transform the notion of medical authority in people's everyday healthcare practice. To answer this question, we conducted an interview study with thirty AISC users. We found that users assess the medical authority of AISCs using various factors including AISCs’ automated decisions and interaction design patterns, associations with established medical authorities like hospitals, and comparisons with other health technologies. We reveal how AISCs are used in healthcare delivery, discuss how AI transforms conventional understandings of medical authority, and derive implications for designing AI-enabled health technology.},

Because of an intricate protocol for record-keeping, supervisors can detect data falsification, and we find they have devised an array of methods, broadly classifiable into four types: triangulation, supplementary data collection, anomaly detection, and interrogation. We also find that the strategies that supervisors use to detect falsification seem linked to their style of management, with authoritarian supervisors preferring supplementary data collection and spot checks, while supportive supervisors use triangulation.

However, the COVID-19 pandemic has prevented many people worldwide from attending their loved ones’ funerals. The authors had the opportunity to assist one family faced with this predicament by webcasting and recording funeral rites held near Tokyo in June, 2020. Using our original 360-degree Telepresence system and smartphones running Zoom, we enabled the deceased’s elder siblings to remotely attend the funeral and did our utmost to make them feel present in the funeral hall. Despite the webcasting via Zoom contributing more to their remote attendances than our system, we discovered thoughtful findings which could be useful for designing remote funeral attendances. From the findings, we also discuss how HCI designers can contribute to this highly sensitive issue, weaving together knowledge from various domains including techno-spiritual practices, thanato-sensitive designs; and other religious and cultural aspects related to death rituals.},

Still, research has remained inconclusive on how presence is affected by human factors such as emotion and agency. Here we adopt a novel design to investigate their effects by testing virtual environments inducing either happiness or fear, with or without user agency. Results from 121 participants showed that the dominant emotion induced by a virtual environment is positively correlated with presence. In addition, agency had a significant positive effect on presence and, furthermore, moderated the effect of emotion on presence. We show for the first time that the effects of emotion and agency on presence are not straightforward but they can be modelled by separating design factors from subjective measures. We discuss how these findings can explain seemingly conflicting results of related work and their implications for VR design.},

This enables the creation of semi-transparent overlays of thumb shadows and inference of fingertip hover points with deep learning, which help the user aim for targets on the phone. A study compares the effect of visual feedback on touch precision in a controlled task and qualitatively evaluates three example applications demonstrating the potential of the technique.

Bridging this gap is necessary for identifying designers’ needs and supporting them. Our interviews with 20 VUI designers identified 12 ways that designers characterize and approach naturalness in VUIs. We categorized these characteristics into three groupings based on the types of conversational context that each characteristic contributes to: Social, Transactional, and Core. Our results contribute new findings on designers’ challenges, such as a design dilemma in augmenting task-oriented VUIs with social conversations, difficulties in writing for spoken language, lack of proper tool support for imbuing synthesized voice with expressivity, and implications for developing design tools and guidelines.},

We showed that participants could more accurately describe UI behaviors with CoCapture than with existing sketch and communication tools and that the resulting descriptions were clear and easy to follow.

In a lab-based within-subjects study, participants (N = 27) completed an emotion recognition task in different heartbeat conditions. We found that hearing heartbeats changed participants’ emotional perspective and increased their reported ability to “feel what the other was feeling.” From these results, we argue that auditory heartbeats are well-suited as an empathic intervention, and might be particularly useful for certain groups and use-contexts because of its musical and non-visual nature.

In this paper, we propose IGScript, a novel script-based interaction grammar tool, to help build scientific data presentation animations for communication. We design a dual-space interface and a compiler which converts natural language-like grammar statements or scripts into a data story animation to make an interactive customization on script-driven data presentations, and then develop a code generator (decompiler) to translate the interactive data exploration animations back into script codes to achieve statement parameters. IGScript makes the presentation animations editable, e.g., it allows to cut, copy, paste, append, or even delete some animation clips. We demonstrate the usability, customizability, and flexibility of IGScript by a user study, four case studies conducted by using four types of commonly-used scientific data, and performance evaluations.},

This paper applies these findings to website design, using an online study to evaluate whether Japanese (N=65) remember more and are faster at finding contextual website information than US Americans (N=84). Our results do not support this hypothesis. Instead, Japanese overall took significantly longer to find information than US participants—a difference that was exacerbated by an increase in website complexity—suggesting that Japanese may holistically take in a website before engaging with detailed information.

While research has suggested many approaches to detect tangibles, the corresponding tangibles are either costly or have a considerable minimal size. This makes them bulky and unattractive for many applications. At the same time, they obscure valuable display space for interaction. To address these shortcomings, we contribute Itsy-Bits: a fabrication pipeline for 3D printing and recognition of tangibles on capacitive touchscreens with a footprint as small as a fingertip. Each Itsy-Bit consists of an enclosing 3D object and a unique conductive 2D shape on its bottom. Using only raw data of commodity capacitive touchscreens, Itsy-Bits reliably identifies and locates a variety of shapes in different sizes and estimates their orientation. Through example applications and a technical evaluation, we demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of Itsy-Bits for tangibles with small footprints.},

Previous work shows this enhances player experience (PX). Until now, it remains unclear whether and how an asymmetric game design with interdependences creates comparably enjoyable PX for both an HMD and a non-HMD player. In this work, we designed and implemented an asymmetric VR game (different in its user interface) with two types of interdependence: strategic (difference in game information/player capability) and biometric (difference in player’s biometric influence). Our mixed-methods user study (N=30) shows that asymmetries positively impact PX for both player roles, that interdependence strongly affects players’ perception of agency, and that biometric feedback—while subjective—is a valuable game mechanic.},

The Regulatory Focus Theory suggests that people follow one of two paradigms while attempting to achieve a goal; by seeking gains (promotion focus - associated with feelings of happiness) or by avoiding losses (prevention focus - associated with feelings of fear). We conducted a study with 69 school children in two different conditions (promotion vs. prevention). We succeeded in inducing happiness emotions in the promotion condition and found a resulting positive effect of the induction on children’s social engagement with the robot. We also discuss the important implications of these results in both educational and child robot interaction fields.},

While road safety statistics and traffic psychology at least define VRUs as pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists, many publications on human-vehicle interaction use the term without even defining it. The actual target group remains unclear. Since each group already poses a broad spectrum of research challenges, a one-fits-all solution seems unrealistic and inappropriate, and a much clearer differentiation is required. To foster clarity and comprehensibility, we propose a literature-based taxonomy providing a structured separation of (vulnerable) road users, designed to particularly (but not exclusively) support research on the communication between VRUs and AVs. It consists of two conceptual hierarchies and will help practitioners and researchers by providing a uniform and comparable set of terms needed for the design, implementation, and description of HCI applications.},

Inspired by traditional techniques, we propose a hand-held tool that augments freehand inking with digital support: projected in-situ guidance assists creating valid on-body circuits and aesthetic ornaments that align with the human bodyscape, while pro-active switching between inking and non-inking creates error preventing constraints. We contribute BodyStylus’s design rationale and interaction concept along with an interactive prototype that uses self-sintering conductive ink. Results of two focus group explorations showed that guidance was more appreciated by artists, while constraints appeared more useful to engineers, and that working on the body inspired critical reflection on the relationship between bodyscape, interaction, and designs.},

The different interaction paradigms led to different interpretations: Turn-taking-actuation was interpreted as a competitive experience, while Joint-actuation was interpreted as a collaborative experience. The interaction paradigms also influenced the intensity of emotions and perception of control, with Joint-actuation leading to more intense emotions and higher sensitivity to control in the interaction. To conclude, our findings show that it is possible to design an actuated-interface that users perceive both as a tangible interface and as a social entity with its own intent.},

In this work, we focus on two manipulation techniques, linear translation and stretching across different distances, and investigate how much discrepancy between the physical proxy and the virtual object may be introduced without participants noticing. In a study with 24 participants, we found that manipulation technique and travel distance significantly affect the detection thresholds, and that visuo-haptic illusions impact performance and accuracy. We show that this technique can be used to enable functional proxy objects that act as stand-ins for multiple virtual objects, illustrating the technique through a showcase VR-DJ application.},

Today, metrics such as ROC AUC, precision, and recall are used to measure technical performance; however, human-computer interaction observes that evaluation of human-facing systems should account for people’s reactions to the system. In this paper, we introduce a transformation that more closely aligns machine learning classification metrics with the values and methods of user-facing performance measures. The disagreement deconvolution takes in any multi-annotator (e.g., crowdsourced) dataset, disentangles stable opinions from noise by estimating intra-annotator consistency, and compares each test set prediction to the individual stable opinions from each annotator. Applying the disagreement deconvolution to existing social computing datasets, we find that current metrics dramatically overstate the performance of many human-facing machine learning tasks: for example, performance on a comment toxicity task is corrected from .95 to .73 ROC AUC.},

Existing training sets suffer from several shortcomings: small size, limited signer diversity, lack of real-world settings, and missing or inaccurate labels. In this work, we present ASL Sea Battle, a sign language game designed to collect datasets that overcome these barriers, while also providing fun and education to users. We conduct a user study to explore the data quality that the game collects, and the user experience of playing the game.

	abstract     = {Speculative design, critical design, and other alternative designs have emerged as popular approaches and burgeoning traditions within HCI and design research. While examples of this work abound, comparatively little theory exists for grasping alternative designs, and for explicating their relation to other types of design and to design in general. In response this paper develops the key concepts of progressional design, frictional design, and design as prefiguration. The progressional conceptualization of design holds that designs have a primary purpose, and that purpose is to ultimately converge toward and ideally arrive at production. The frictional conceptualization of design radically relaxes teleological assumptions and productional expectations. Frictional designs prefigure possibilities that are compellingly resistant to further progression and final production. Prefiguration grounds both progression and friction in the idea that designs are partial, provisional, and potentially preliminary actualizations of possible futures. To illustrate frictional design, this paper outlines a framework of 5 frictional tendencies: diverging, opposing, accelerating, counterfactualizing, and analogizing. These tendencies represent ways in which frictional designs are directionally in tension with the arrow-like vector of progressional design. Several additional concepts are discussed in conclusion to further explicate more nuanced relational potentials between friction and progression: transproductional uses, teleological ambiguity, and relational multiplicity.},

Character believability was influenced negatively by visual elements of the simulation, and positively by behavioural elements, which complements findings from previous work. We recommend the use of VR for simulations of confrontational behaviour, where a realistic emotional response is part of the intended experience.

This paper uses person-centric and momentary context features to understand optimal ad-timing. In a quasi-experimental study on a three-month longitudinal dataset of 100K Snapchat users, we find ad timing influences ad effectiveness. We draw insights on the relationship between ad effectiveness and momentary behaviors such as duration, interactivity, and interaction diversity. We simulate ad reallocation, finding that our study-driven insights lead to greater value for the platform.

We bridge this knowledge gap by evaluating how Android’s Smart Lock (SL), which is the first widely deployed IA solution on smartphones, is understood by its users. We conducted a qualitative user study (N=26) and an online survey (N=331). The results suggest that users often have difficulty understanding SL semantics, leaving them unable to judge when their phone would be (un)locked. We found that various aspects of SL, such as its capabilities and its authentication factors, are confusing for the users.

However, there has been little research into distractor effects on crossing-based interaction. We thus conducted an empirical study on pen-based interfaces to investigate six crossing tasks with distractor interference in comparison to two tasks without it. The six distractor-related tasks differed in movement precision constraint (directional/amplitude), target size, target distance, distractor location and target-distractor spacing. We also developed and experimentally validated six quantitative models for the six tasks. Our results show that crossing targets with distractors had longer average times and similar accuracy than that without distractors. The effects of distractors varied depending on distractor location, target-distractor spacing and movement precision constraint. When spacing is smaller than 11.27 mm, crossing tasks with distractor interference can be regarded as pointing tasks or a combination of pointing and crossing tasks, which could be better fitted with our proposed models than Fitts’ law. According to these results, we provide practical implications to crossing-based user interface design.},

Specifically, it perturbs the voice in the video to direct their attention without consuming their conscious awareness. Our experiments not only confirmed the validity of the proposed approach but also emphasized its advantages in combination with a machine learning-based sensing module. Namely, it would not frustrate users even though the intervention is activated by false-positive detection of their attentive state.

While originally positioned as a critique of dominant user-research methods, literature on Probes rarely reflects on such critical dimensions nor explicitly articulates the intents of using Probes as research artifacts. We conducted interviews with 12 design researchers who have worked with Probes within diverse Research through Design projects, exploring direct accounts of how and why Probes are used in practice. Our interviews brought to the fore the critical concerns behind Probe practices in relation to the language of Probing, relationships with participants, and motivations to challenge normative practices. While the pluralistic interpretations of Probes offered by our participants brings challenges, we discuss how making visible the critical motivations of our research opens up new ways of practicing and disseminating Probes.},

Current research into AR-based mobility aids has focused mainly on the technical aspects, and less emphasis has been placed on understanding the usability and suitability of these aids in people with various levels of visual impairment. In this paper, we present the results of qualitative interviews with 18 participants using HoloLens v1 and eight prototype augmentations to understand how these enhancements are perceived by people with low vision and how these aids should be adjusted to suit their needs. Our results suggested that participants with moderate vision loss could potentially perceive the most benefit from glasses and underlined the importance of extensive customizability to accommodate the needs of a highly varied low vision population.},

Several taxonomies consider a large number of attributes (e.g., hardware, accessibility) to characterize these techniques. However, finding the appropriate locomotion technique (LT) and identifying gaps for future designs in the high-dimensional space of attributes can be quite challenging. To aid analysis and innovation, we devised Locomotion Vault (https://locomotionvault.github.io/), a database and visualization of over 100 LTs from academia and industry. We propose similarity between LTs as a metric to aid navigation and visualization. We show that similarity based on attribute values correlates with expert similarity assessments (a method that does not scale). Our analysis also highlights an inherent trade-off between simulation sickness and accessibility across LTs. As such, Locomotion Vault shows to be a tool that unifies information on LTs and enables their standardization and large-scale comparison to help understand the space of possibilities in VR locomotion.},

However, despite increasing interest in interpretability, there remains no firm consensus on how to measure it. This is especially true in representation learning, where interpretability research has focused on “disentanglement” measures only applicable to synthetic datasets and not grounded in human factors. We introduce a task to quantify the human-interpretability of generative model representations, where users interactively modify representations to reconstruct target instances. On synthetic datasets, we find performance on this task much more reliably differentiates entangled and disentangled models than baseline approaches. On a real dataset, we find it differentiates between representation learning methods widely believed but never shown to produce more or less interpretable models. In both cases, we ran small-scale think-aloud studies and large-scale experiments on Amazon Mechanical Turk to confirm that our qualitative and quantitative results agreed.},

Results of twelve semi-structured interviews and 175 online survey responses suggest generally positive attitudes toward breastfeeding and good theoretical knowledge. This is combined with a complex lived experience of breastfeeding where main challenges are situated in practical, emotional, and environmental/societal aspects, which are currently not sufficiently recognised by technology that seeks to support breastfeeding. Building upon our findings, we present points for reflection for the design of technology to support breastfeeding, focusing on the importance of drawing from the lived experience of parents, and ensuring that technology not only casts breastfeeding as an individual but also as a collective effort.},

BVI people also reported video accessibility heuristics that characterize accessible and inaccessible videos. We instantiate 7 of the identified heuristics (2 audio-related, 2 video-related, and 3 audio-visual) as automated metrics to assess video accessibility. We collected a dataset of accessibility ratings of videos by BVI people and found that our automatic video accessibility metrics correlated with the accessibility ratings (Adjusted R2 = 0.642). We augmented a video search interface with our video accessibility metrics and predictions. BVI people using our augmented video search interface selected an accessible video more efficiently than when using the original search interface. By integrating video accessibility metrics, video hosting platforms could help people surface accessible videos and encourage content creators to author more accessible products, improving video accessibility for all.},

In many design studies, synthesis has been investigated in the contexts of everyday design—bicycle frames, sewing machines, commercial architecture. We were interested in how it might apply in contexts of reflective design, whose pragmatics often depend on different interrelationships between users and technological products. In this paper, we argue that designing everyday use objects for reflection requires a synthesis of two apparently opposite forms: conventionally practical forms, since they are everyday use objects, and evocative forms, since they make users think. We provide two examples of everyday objects for reflection that we believe synthesize both conventionally practical and evocative forms, analyzing the design processes that led to these forms, and discussing how these reflective designs embody different forms of synthesis.},

In a qualitative lab study, we observed 30 participants (15 pairs) compose a musical phrase in pairs, both with and without AI. Our findings reveal that AI may play important roles in influencing human social dynamics during creativity, including: 1) implicitly seeding a common ground at the start of collaboration, 2) acting as a psychological safety net in creative risk-taking, 3) providing a force for group progress, 4) mitigating interpersonal stalling and friction, and 5) altering users’ collaborative and creative roles.

We show that minimal user interaction using our technique enables better sketch vectorization than state of art automated approaches. A user study, further shows our interface to be simple, fun and easy to use, yet effectively able to process messy images with a mix of construction lines, noisy and incomplete curves, sketched with arbitrary stroke style.},

However, when relevant data is found on the web, it is often scattered across multiple tables on different web pages, requiring tedious manual searching and copy-pasting to collect data. We propose KTabulator, an interactive system to effectively extract, build, or extend ad hoc tables from large corpora, by leveraging their computerized structures in the form of knowledge graphs. We developed and evaluated KTabulator using Wikipedia and its knowledge graph DBpedia as our testbed. Starting from an entity or an existing table, KTabulator allows users to extend their tables by finding relevant entities, their properties, and other relevant tables, while providing meaningful suggestions and guidance. The results of a user study indicate the usefulness and efficiency of KTabulator in ad hoc table creation.},

Through a repertory grid study (N=21), a review of key subjective questionnaires, an expert review of resulting word pairs and an online study of 356 users of speech interfaces, we identify three key dimensions that make up a users’ partner model: 1) perceptions towards partner competence and dependability; 2) assessment of human-likeness; and 3) a system’s perceived cognitive flexibility. We discuss the implications for partner modelling as a concept, emphasising the importance of salience and the dynamic nature of these perceptions.},

While advances have been made, it is possible that further progress could be made if there were a deeper understanding of the adaptive nature of the mechanisms that guide eye movement and vision. Control of eye movement typically results in a sequence of movements (saccades) and fixations followed by a ‘dwell’ at a target and a selection. To shed light on how these sequences are planned, this paper presents a computational model of the control of eye movements in gaze-based selection. We formulate the model as an optimal sequential planning problem bounded by the limits of the human visual and motor systems and use reinforcement learning to approximate optimal solutions. The model accurately replicates earlier results on the effects of target size and distance and captures a number of other aspects of performance. The model can be used to predict number of fixations and duration required to make a gaze-based selection. The future development of the model is discussed.},

Guided by our formative interviews with guitar players and prior literature, we designed Soloist, a mixed-initiative learning framework that automatically generates customizable curriculums from off-the-shelf guitar video lessons. Soloist takes raw videos as input and leverages deep-learning based audio processing to extract musical information. This back-end processing is used to provide an interactive visualization to support effective video navigation and real-time feedback on the user's performance, creating a guided learning experience. We demonstrate the capabilities and specific use-cases of Soloist within the domain of learning electric guitar solos using instructional YouTube videos.

Thus, conversational agents (CAs) have gained much attention as a potential counselor because CAs’ characteristics (e.g., anonymity) could mitigate various difficulties of human-human interaction (HHI). Despite the potentials, it is difficult to design a CA for survivors because various aspects should be considered. Especially, with traditional HCI approaches only (e.g., need-finding and usability tests), designers could easily miss psychological and subjective burdens that survivors feel toward a new system. Hence, while envisioning a burden-free CA for survivors, we agilely designed and implemented an initial prototype CA (NamuBot) with professionals (the police and counselors). We then conducted a qualitative user study to identify and compare burdens caused by the CA vs. humans. Lastly, we codesigned design features that could reduce the CA-bound burdens with 36 participants (19 survivors and 17 professionals). Notably, our findings showed that 17 survivors preferred reporting their case to NamuBot over humans, expressing far less burden. Although CAs could also place burdens on survivors, the burdens could be alleviated by the features that the survivors and professionals designed. Finally, we present design implications and strategies to develop burden-mitigating CAs for survivors.},

We also study the influence that the Contextual Integrity parameters and personal factors have on the privacy norms. Further, we identify the similarities in terms of the Contextual Integrity parameters of the privacy norms studied to distill more general privacy norms, which could be useful, for instance, to establish suitable privacy defaults in SPA. We finally provide recommendations for SPA and third-party skill providers based on the privacy norms studied.},

While people are typically aware of the deletion feature, it is infrequently used. When used, it is primarily done so to improve conversations by reducing confusion between conversation partners. We found people being aware of message deletions creating information-gaps which can provoke curiosity in recipients, causing them to develop narratives to help address the uncertainty. We found concerns amongst senders that these narratives would be of a negative nature, having an undesirable impact on how others perceive them.

Haptic guidance (HG) improves users’ task performance through physical interaction between robots and users. It can be classified into optimal action-based HG (OAHG), which assists users with an optimal action, and user prediction-based HG (UPHG), which assists users with their next predicted action. This study aims to understand the difference between OAHG and UPHG and propose a combined HG (CombHG) that achieves optimal performance by complementing each HG type, which has important implications for HG design. We propose implementation methods for each HG type using deep learning-based approaches. A user study (n=20) in a haptic task environment indicated that UPHG induces better subjective evaluations, such as naturalness and comfort, than OAHG. In addition, the CombHG that we proposed further decreases the disagreement between the user intention and HG, without reducing the objective and subjective scores.},

Analysis of epistemic burden encourages researchers to rethink the purpose and value of data in community organizing and activism more generally. This paper describes three varieties of epistemic burden drawn from two case studies based on the authors’ previous work with anti-police brutality community organizations. The authors conclude with a discussion of ways to alleviate and avoid these issues through a series of questions about participatory research design. Ultimately, we call for a reorientation of knowledge production away from putative design solutions to community problems and toward a more robust interrogation of the power dynamics of research itself.},

We reviewed 53 papers and performed a thematic analysis to describe and synthesize the current conversation across HCI. We found many describe the value of ethical theories and implement them as technical contributions, but very few conduct empirical studies in real settings. Furthermore, we found AMA development is dominated by two ethical theories: deontology and consequentialism. We argue that the focus on deontology and consequentialism risks creating AMAs based on a narrow set of Western ethical values and concepts at the expense of other forms of moral reasoning.},

	abstract     = {Monitoring advertising around controversial issues is an important step in ensuring accountability and transparency of political processes. To that end, we use the Facebook Ads Library to collect 2312 migration-related advertising campaigns in Italy over one year. Our pro- and anti-immigration classifier (F1=0.85) reveals a partisan divide among the major Italian political parties, with anti-immigration ads accounting for nearly 15M impressions. Although composing 47.6% of all migration-related ads, anti-immigration ones receive 65.2% of impressions. We estimate that about two thirds of all captured campaigns use some kind of demographic targeting by location, gender, or age. We find sharp divides by age and gender: for instance, anti-immigration ads from major parties are 17% more likely to be seen by a male user than a female. Unlike pro-migration parties, we find that anti-immigration ones reach a similar demographic to their own voters. However their audience change with topic: an ad from anti-immigration parties is 24% more likely to be seen by a male user when the ad speaks about migration, than if it does not. Furthermore, the viewership of such campaigns tends to follow the volume of mainstream news around immigration, supporting the theory that political advertisers try to “ride the wave” of current news. We conclude with policy implications for political communication: since the Facebook Ads Library does not allow to distinguish between advertisers intentions and algorithmic targeting, we argue that more details should be shared by platforms regarding the targeting configuration of socio-political campaigns.},

Through a formative study we find people shared information about design intent, work processes, problems encountered, to-do items, and other useful information. We developed a prototype that supports think-aloud computing by prompting users to speak and contextualizing speech with labels and application context. Our evaluation shows more subtle design decisions and process explanations were captured in think-aloud than via traditional documentation.

Although typically limited to just a few meters of sensing range, the use of retroreflective markers can boost this to 1km or more. Fortuitously, cities already make extensive use of retroreflective materials for street signs, construction barriers, road studs, license plates, and many other markings. We describe how our prototype system can co-opt these existing markers at very long ranges and use them as unpowered accelerometers for use in a wide variety of sensing applications.},

One of the main ways that people remember locations in the real world is landmarks – so we carried out a study to investigate how users remember commands and navigate in four common applications (Word, Facebook, Reader, and Photoshop). Our study revealed that people strongly rely on landmarks that are readily available in the interface (e.g., layout, corners, and edges) to orient themselves and remember commands.

As cars are evolving towards autonomy and taking over control, e.g. in the form of autopilots, it becomes harder for drivers to pinpoint the root causes of a car’s malfunctioning. Drivers may need additional information to assess these ambiguous situations correctly. However, it is yet unclear which information is relevant and helpful to drivers in such situations. Hence, we conducted a mixed-methods online survey (N = 60) on Amazon MTurk where we exposed participants to two security- and safety-critical situations with one of three different explanations. We applied Thematic and Correspondence Analysis to understand which factors in these situations moderate drivers’ information demand. We identified a fundamental information demand across scenarios that is expanded by error-specific information types. Moreover, we found that it is necessary to communicate error sources, since drivers might not be able to identify them correctly otherwise. Thereby, malicious intrusions are typically perceived as more critical than technical malfunctions.},

Results show that (1) our designed uncertain elements are instrumental in increasing exertion levels; (2) when playing a motion-based first-person perspective exergame, virtual reality can improve performance, while maintaining the same motion sickness level as a large display; and (3) exergames for middle-aged adults should be designed with age-related declines in mind, similar to designing for elderly adults. We also framed two design guidelines for exergames that have similar features to the game used in this research.},

	abstract     = {We propose a technique that allows an unprecedented level of dexterity in electrical muscle stimulation (EMS), i.e., it allows interactive EMS-based devices to flex the user's fingers independently of each other. EMS is a promising technique for force feedback because of its small form factor when compared to mechanical actuators. However, the current EMS approach to flexing the user's fingers (i.e., attaching electrodes to the base of the forearm, where finger muscles anchor) is limited by its inability to flex a target finger's metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint independently of the other fingers. In other words, current EMS devices cannot flex one finger alone, they always induce unwanted actuation to adjacent fingers. To tackle the lack of dexterity, we propose and validate a new electrode layout that places the electrodes on the back of the hand, where they stimulate the interossei/lumbricals muscles in the palm, which have never received attention with regards to EMS. In our user study, we found that our technique offers four key benefits when compared to existing EMS electrode layouts: our technique (1) flexes all four fingers around the MCP joint more independently; (2) has less unwanted flexion of other joints (such as the proximal interphalangeal joint); (3) is more robust to wrist rotations; and (4) reduces calibration time. Therefore, our EMS technique enables applications for interactive EMS systems that require a level of flexion dexterity not available until now. We demonstrate the improved dexterity with four example applications: three musical instrumental tutorials (piano, drum, and guitar) and a VR application that renders force feedback in individual fingers while manipulating a yo-yo.},

Data Animator leverages the Data Illustrator framework to analyze and match objects between two static visualizations, and generates automated transitions by default. Designers have the flexibility to interpret and adjust the matching results through a visual interface. Data Animator also supports the division of a complex animation into stages through hierarchical keyframes, and uses data attributes to stagger the start time and vary the speed of animating objects through a novel timeline interface.

We propose a method for animating blood flow patterns, based on a data-driven physiological model that can be used to directly augment the appearance of synthetic avatars and photo-realistic faces. While the changes are difficult for participants to “see”, they significantly more frequently select faces with blood flow as more anthropomorphic and animated than faces without blood flow.

In order to reduce frustration and help fulfill the promise of smart homes, we need to explore the experience of security and privacy in situ. We analyze an ethnographic study observing six UK households over six months to present a longitudinal view of security and privacy user experiences in smart products. We find inconsistencies in managing security and privacy, e.g., contrasting the ease of granting and difficulty of withholding consent.

We propose Winder, a Figma plugin that addresses these challenges through linked tapes—multimodal comments of clicks and voice. Bidirectional links between the clicked-on objects and voice recordings facilitate understanding tapes: selecting objects retrieves relevant recordings, and playing recordings highlights related objects. By periodically prompting users to produce tapes, Winder preemptively obtains information to satisfy potential communication needs. Through a five-day study with eight teams of three, we evaluated the system’s impact on teams asynchronously designing graphical user interfaces. Our findings revealed that producing linked tapes could be as lightweight as face-to-face (F2F) interactions while transmitting intentions more precisely than text.

We first discuss the design decisions behind relevant components of the system, then analyze the efficacy of the different versions through a Wizard of Oz study with university students. Our results show that while a simple interface with no revision feedback is easier to use, an interface that provides a detailed categorization of sentence-level revisions is the most helpful based on user survey data, as well as the most effective based on improvement in writing outcomes.},

This paper then diverges from similar surveys of research addressing the body in HCI in that it is more disruptive and offers a critique of these approaches and pointers for where HCI might go next. We end our paper with recommendations drawn from across the different approaches to the body in HCI. In particular, that researchers working with the body have much to gain from the 4th wave HCI approach when designing with and for the body, where our relationships with technologies are understood as entangled and the body is always more-than-human.},

We identified N=2,000 users who shared false political news on Twitter, and replied to their false tweets with links to fact-checking websites. We find causal evidence that being corrected decreases the quality, and increases the partisan slant and language toxicity, of the users’ subsequent retweets (but has no significant effect on primary tweets). This suggests that being publicly corrected by another user shifts one's attention away from accuracy - presenting an important challenge for social correction approaches.},

In this paper, we disentangle the impact of the associated task and of the virtual content on the attentional tunneling effect by measuring reaction times to events in two user studies. We found that presenting virtual content did not significantly increase user reaction times to events, but adding a task to the content did.

Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork, the paper traces the histories of interaction and portraitures that the three stakeholders bring to their description and interpretation of the POS machine. It shows that an active POS machine provokes the stakeholders in the PDS to view it as an artifact that invites engagement on practical, moral, and knowledge dimensions. The varying ‘biographies’ that stakeholders narrate of the POS machine, collectively reveal the design, disposition, and functioning of a social justice infrastructure that rests on the compulsions of biometric technologies to improve inclusion and deter corruption in welfare delivery.},

We propose DistanciAR, a novel tablet-based workflow for remote AR authoring. Our baseline solution involves three steps. A remote environment is captured by a camera with LiDAR; then, the author creates an AR experience from a different location using AR interactions; finally, a remote viewer consumes the AR content on site. A formative study revealed understanding and navigating the remote space as key challenges with this solution. We improved the authoring interface by adding two novel modes: Dollhouse, which renders a bird’s-eye view, and Peek, which creates photorealistic composite images using captured images. A second study compared this improved system with the baseline, and participants reported that the new modes made it easier to understand and navigate the remote scene.},

To address this, teammate matching sites external to games have emerged and enable gamers to offer to play games with others in exchange for payment. The affordances of these services are different from other existing gamer social sites, e.g., live streaming. Interviews were conducted with 16 dedicated users on Bixin, one of China’s largest paid teammate matching sites, to examine user motivations, practices, and perceptions. The interviews found that gamers selected paid teammates on Bixin using different criteria compared to in-game matchmaking services and emphasized the importance of real-life characteristics such as voice. To maintain connections, paid teammates often also extended communication to external communication services such as WeChat. Although most gamers expected to communicate with paid teammates as if they were friends, very few reported building real friendships with their matched counterparts.},

Compared to propeller-based approaches, JetController supports 10-30 times faster impulse frequency, and its handheld device is significantly lighter and more compact. JetController supports a wide range of haptic events in games and VR experiences, from firing automatic weapons in games like Halo (15Hz) to slicing fruits in Fruit Ninja (up to 45Hz). To evaluate JetController, we integrated our prototype with two popular VR games, Half-life: Alyx and Beat Saber, to support a variety of 3D interactions.

Behaviors at the exhibits included individuals focusing beyond their personal activity towards companions’ interaction, adults participating via physical interaction, and visitors taking opportunities to interact when companions moved between sections of the exhibit or stepped back from interaction. We demonstrate how exhibits’ physical configuration and interactive control engendered behavioral patterns. Systematic analysis reveals how different configurations (concerning physical-spatial hardware and interactive software) distribute control differently amongst visitors. We present four mechanisms for how control can be distributed at an interactive installation: functional, temporal, physical and indirect verbal. In summary, our work explores how mechanisms that distribute control influence patterns of shared interaction with the exhibits and social interaction between museum visitor companions.},

Through laboratory studies, we find that 18 clinicians generally build intuition of when to rely on automation and when to exercise their own judgement. However, when presented with fully pre-populated suggestions, these expert users exhibit less agency: accepting improper mentions, and taking less initiative in creating additional annotations.

To explore this idea, we present a technique for standard 360° video that shrinks FoVs only during VIMS inducing scenes. It uses Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping and peripheral optical flow to compute camera movements and reduces FoV during rapid motion or optical flow. A user study (N=23) comparing 360° video with unrestricted-FoVs (90°), reduced fixed-FoVs (40°) and dynamic-FoVs (40°-90°) revealed that dynamic-FoVs mitigate VIMS while maintaining presence.

To fill in this gap, we interview 100 L2 English learners and 22 professional native teachers to understand their needs and experiences. Three critical metrics are proposed for both learners and teachers to identify the best exaggeration levels in both audio and visual modalities. Additionally, we incorporate the personalized dynamic feedback mechanism given the English proficiency of learners.

In this paper, we propose a unifying account of touchscreen typing, regarding it as optimal supervisory control. Under this theory, rules for controlling visuo-motor resources are learned via exploration in pursuit of maximal typing performance. The paper outlines the control problem and explains how visual and motor limitations affect it. We then present a model, implemented via reinforcement learning, that simulates co-ordination of eye and finger movements. Comparison with human data affirms that the model creates realistic finger- and eye-movement patterns and shows human-like adaptation.

The technical literature points to data and model uncertainties as two main properties of ML. Through post-phenomenology, we position uncertainty as one defining material attribute of ML processes which mediate human experience. To understand ML uncertainty as a design material, we investigate four design research case studies involving ML. We derive three provocative concepts: thingly uncertainty: ML-driven artefacts have uncertain, variable relations to their environments; pattern leakage: ML uncertainty can lead to patterns shaping the world they are meant to represent; and futures creep: ML technologies texture human relations to time with uncertainty. Finally, we outline design research trajectories and sketch a post-phenomenological approach to human-ML relations.},

Sensing technologies provide a means to harness curiosity about the animals living in these spaces, and possibly also connect interest to care. Yet little is known as to how people may use these technologies, or the implications for human-nature relations. To learn more, we gave commercial camera traps to ten adult participants to understand how they explored their gardens, what they wanted to learn, and what they did with this knowledge. We discovered trade-offs between control and care; the usefulness of different media and mystery; the temporalities of engaging in natural sensing practice; and a prevalence of sharing media within households. We discuss design for convivial cohabitation with the creatures in our garden. This research contributes to better human-nature relations through citizen sensing, as well as HCI for urban biodiversity conservation.},

However, it is challenging to use simulation as an aid during interactive debugging of physical circuits, due to difficulties in comparing simulated analyses with hardware measurements. Designers must continually configure simulations to match the state of the physical circuit (e.g. capturing sensor inputs), and must manually rework the hardware to replicate changes or analyses performed in simulation. We propose techniques leveraging instrumentation and programmable test hardware to create a tight coupling between a physical circuit and its simulated model. Bridging these representations helps designers to compare simulated and measured behaviors, and to quickly perform analytical techniques on hardware (e.g. parameter-response analysis) that are typically cumbersome outside of simulation. We implement these techniques in a prototype and show how it aids in efficiently debugging a variety of analog circuits.},

We conducted a user study to understand self-report collection from NPC dialogues and traditional in-game overlay questionnaires. Data quality and player experience measures autonomy, curiosity, immersion, and mastery did not differ significantly, although NPC dialogues enhanced meaning. NPC dialogues supported an increase in data quantity through voluntary 5-point scales but not via open responses; however, they also increased the perceived intimacy of shared information despite comparable objective intimacy.

A WallToken is a passive token whose footprint is recognized on a tactile surface. It is equipped with a push-handle that controls a suction cup. This makes it easy for users to switch between sliding the token or attaching it to the wall. We describe how to build such tokens and how to recognize them on a tactile surface.

Findings suggested that skill and knowledge sharing, entertaining arts, homelife activities, live chatting, and gameplay were the most popular video styles. YouTubers utilized parasocial relationships to form a space for staying away from the disaster. SHWM YouTubers provided friend-like, mentor-like, and family-like provisions through videos in different styles. Family-like provisions led to the highest overall viewer engagement.

We developed a convolutional neural network model efficient enough for battery powered and computationally constrained processors. Its model size and inference time is less than 1/5000 compared to an existing gesture recognition technique using radar.

Chronic homesickness can exacerbate mood problems, erode academic performance and lead to dropout from school. The present research examines how students use digital technologies to resolve the experience of missing home. Qualitative interviews and diaries with 50 students at major Australian universities revealed that technologies play a significant role in alleviating homesickness. Specifically, students use technologies to acquire social contact, find help and support, build co-presence to recreate their home, connect with culture, experience distant places, and regulate emotions. However, the use of technology sometimes led to increased emotional labour, frequent exposure to homesickness triggers, and heightened perceptions of distance. We conclude by discussing possible design implications for new technologies that allow students to alleviate homesickness by experiencing their home from afar.},

	abstract     = {In ad-hoc human-robot collaboration (HRC), humans and robots work on a task without pre-planning the robot's actions prior to execution; instead, task allocation occurs in real-time. However, prior research has largely focused on task allocations that are pre-planned - there has not been a comprehensive exploration or evaluation of techniques where task allocation is adjusted in real-time. Inspired by HCI research on territoriality and proxemics, we propose a design space of novel task allocation techniques including both explicit techniques, where the user maintains agency, and implicit techniques, where the efficiency of automation can be leveraged. The techniques were implemented and evaluated using a tabletop HRC simulation in VR. A 16-participant study, which presented variations of a collaborative block stacking task, showed that implicit techniques enable efficient task completion and task parallelization, and should be augmented with explicit mechanisms to provide users with fine-grained control.},

We designed four gaze-supported techniques that leverage different combination strategies for object manipulation and evaluated them in two user studies. Overall, we show that gaze did not offer significant performance benefits for transforming objects in the primary working space, where all objects were located in front of the user and within the arm-reach distance, but can be useful for a larger environment with distant targets.

Through in-depth interviews with 21 workers, we found that 1) employees feel six types of burdens (i.e., emotional, mental, bias, manipulation, privacy, and social) toward AI's introduction to human resource management (HRM), and that 2) these burdens could be mitigated by incorporating transparency, interpretability, and human intervention to algorithmic decision-making. Based on our findings, we present design efforts to alleviate employees’ burdens.

We interviewed them before and after the probe study and found that while technological sensing was able to increase drivers’ awareness of their well-being status and intention to modify behaviors.

Participants expressed that the inaccessibility of these artboards contributes to significant educational and professional barriers. We found that the key problems faced were: (1) high cognitive loads from a lack of feedback about artboard contents and object state; (2) difficulty determining relationships among artboard objects; and (3) constant uncertainty about whether object manipulations were successful.

In this study, we first defined the concept of tactile fixation, then we conducted a behavioral study with ten participants with VI in order to assess the role of tactile fixations under different conditions. The results show that tactile fixations vary according to different factors such as the graphic type as well as the involved hand and the aim of the exploration.},

	abstract     = {Traumatic injuries require timely intervention, but medical expertise is not always available at the patient’s location. Despite recent advances in telecommunications, surgeons still have limited tools to remotely help inexperienced surgeons. Mixed Reality hints at a future where remote collaborators work side-by-side as if co-located; however, we still do not know how current technology can improve remote surgical collaboration. Through role-playing and iterative-prototyping, we identify collaboration practices used by expert surgeons to aid novice surgeons as well as technical requirements to facilitate these practices. We then introduce ARTEMIS, an AR-VR collaboration system that supports these key practices. Through an observational study with two expert surgeons and five novice surgeons operating on cadavers, we find that ARTEMIS supports remote surgical mentoring of novices through synchronous point, draw, and look affordances and asynchronous video clips. Most participants found that ARTEMIS facilitates collaboration despite existing technology limitations explored in this paper.},

In a controlled experiment, participants with T2D found that goal suggestions were understandable and actionable. A 4-week in-the-wild deployment study showed that receiving goal suggestions augmented participants’ self-discovery, choosing goals highlighted the multifaceted nature of personal preferences, and the experience of following goals demonstrated the importance of feedback and context. However, we identified tensions between abstract goals and concrete eating experiences and found static text too ambiguous for complex concepts.

When the user's finger wearing our voice-coil contacts any of the interactive patches it detects its magnetic signature via magnetometer and vibrates the patch, adding haptic feedback to otherwise input-only interactions. To allow these passive patches to vibrate, we make them from silicone with regions doped with polarized neodymium powder, resulting in soft and stretchable magnets. This stretchable form-factor allows them to be wrapped to the user's body or everyday objects of various shapes. We demonstrate how these add haptic output to many situations, such as adding haptic buttons to the walls of one's home. In our technical evaluation, we demonstrate that our interactive patches can be excited across a wide range of frequencies (0-500 Hz) and can be tuned to resonate at specific frequencies based on the patch's geometry. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MagnetIO's vibration intensity is as powerful as a typical linear resonant actuator (LRA); yet, unlike these rigid actuators, our passive patches operate as springs with multiple modes of vibration, which enables a wider band around its resonant frequency than an equivalent LRA.},

Data workers only need to upload their dataset, then the system can automatically suggest ML configurations, preprocess data, select algorithm, and train the model. These suggestions are presented to the user via a web-based graphical user interface and a notebook-based programming user interface. Our goal is to offer a systematic investigation of user interaction and perceptions of using an AutoDS system in solving a data science task. We studied AutoDS with 30 professional data scientists, where one group used AutoDS, and the other did not, to complete a data science project. As expected, AutoDS improves productivity; Yet surprisingly, we find that the models produced by the AutoDS group have higher quality and less errors, but lower human confidence scores. We reflect on the findings by presenting design implications for incorporating automation techniques into human work in the data science lifecycle.},

Importantly, after giving feedback, users were also asked to recall the data practices described in the notices. The experimental setup included the variation of different levels of saliency and riskiness of the privacy notices. Based on a total sample of 2,274 participants, our findings indicate that concise privacy notices are indeed a promising approach to raise user awareness for privacy information when displayed in a salient way, especially in case the notices describe risky data practices.

	abstract     = {Due to advances in deep learning, gestures have become a more common tool for human-computer interaction. When implementing a large amount of training data, deep learning models show remarkable performance in gesture recognition. Since it is expensive and time consuming to collect gesture data from people, we are often confronted with a practicality issue when managing the quantity and quality of training data. It is a well-known fact that increasing training data variability can help to improve the generalization performance of machine learning models. Thus, we directly intervene in the collection of gesture data to increase human gesture variability by adding some words (called styling words) into the data collection instructions, e.g., giving the instruction "perform gesture #1 faster" as opposed to "perform gesture #1." Through an in-depth analysis of gesture features and video-based gesture recognition, we have confirmed the advantageous use of styling words in gesture training data collection.},

It also enables users to refine the animation specification (e.g., aligning keyframes across tracks to play them together, adjusting delay) with direct manipulation and other parameters for animation effects (e.g., animation type, easing function) using a control panel. In addition to describing how CAST infers recommendations for auto-completion, we present a gallery of examples to demonstrate the expressiveness of CAST and a user study to verify its learnability and usability.

We found that learning with hobbyist equipment and online social networks could emulate using industrial equipment in shared workshops. Furthermore, at-home digital fabrication offered unique learning opportunities including more iteration, machine tuning, and maintenance. These opportunities depended on new forms of labor and varied based on student living situations. Our findings have implications for remote and in-person digital fabrication instruction. They indicate how access to tools was important, but not as critical as providing opportunities for iteration; they show how remote fabrication exacerbated student inequities; and they suggest strategies for evaluating trade-offs in remote fabrication models with respect to learning objectives.},

While many studies have used different approaches for backchannel prediction, they all have depended on manual annotations for a large dataset. This is a bottleneck impacting the scalability of development. To this end, we propose using semi-supervised techniques to automate the process of identifying backchannels, thereby easing the annotation process. To analyze our identification module’s feasibility, we compared the backchannel prediction models trained on (a) manually-annotated and (b) semi-supervised labels. Quantitative analysis revealed that the proposed semi-supervised approach could attain 95% of the former’s performance. Our user-study findings revealed that almost 60% of the participants found the backchannel responses predicted by the proposed model more natural. Finally, we also analyzed the impact of personality on the type of backchannel signals and validated our findings in the user-study.},

In this paper, we first model the amount of satisfaction conveyed in the support-seekers’ replies to the received comments. Then we quantitatively examine how seekers’ expressed satisfaction is affected by their community knowledge, sought and received support in an OMHC. Results show that support-seekers with more posting experience generally display less contentment to the received comments. Compared to newcomers, higher tenured members express less satisfaction when receiving informational support. We also found that support matching positively predicts seekers’ satisfaction regardless of their community knowledge.

We found that young children’s media content selection may be best understood as an ecologically situated process involving the interplay between the content, the child, their family, community, and societal spheres. Children do not make media selections on their own. Rather, these choices are supported or constrained by a range of resource, culture, and policy factors specific to family and community background.

However, little research has investigated how AI curriculum and tools can be designed to be more accessible to all teachers and learners. In this study, we take a Value-Sensitive Design approach to understanding the role of teacher values in the design of AI curriculum and tools, and identifying opportunities to integrate AI into core curriculum to leverage learners’ interests. We organized co-design workshops with 15 K-12 teachers, where teachers and researchers co-created lesson plans using AI tools and embedding AI concepts into various core subjects. We found that K-12 teachers need additional scaffolding in AI tools and curriculum to facilitate ethics and data discussions, and value supports for learner evaluation and engagement, peer-to-peer collaboration, and critical reflection. We present an exemplar lesson plan that shows entry points for teaching AI in non-computing subjects and reflect on co-designing with K-12 teachers in a remote setting.},

We conducted interviews with 17 families who have naturally adopted child-owned wearables to understand how they use wearables individually and collaboratively. Parents are primarily motivated to use child-owned wearables for children's long-term health and wellbeing, whereas children mostly seek out entertainment and feeling accomplished through reaching goals. Children are often unable to interpret or contextualize the measures that wearables record, while parents do not regularly track these measures and focus on deviations from their children's routines. We discuss opportunities for making naturally-occurring family moments educational to positively contribute to children's conceptual understanding of health, such as developing age-appropriate trackable metrics for shared goal-setting and data reflection.},

We investigated CCs between active haptic experiences of tangible 3D objects, visual colour and emotion using the “Bouba/Kiki” paradigm. We asked 30 participants to assign colours and emotional categories to 3D-printed objects with varying degrees of angularity and complexity. We found tendencies to associate high degrees of complexity and angularity with red colours, low brightness and high arousal levels. Less complex round shapes were associated with blue colours, high brightness and positive valence levels. These findings contrast previously reported crossmodal effects triggered by 2D shapes of similar angularity and complexity, suggesting that designers cannot simply extrapolate potential perceptual and interpretive experiences elicited by 2D shapes to seemingly similar 3D tangible objects. Instead, we propose a design space for creating tangible multisensory artefacts that can trigger specific emotional percepts and discuss implications for exploiting CCs in the design of interactive technology.},

Our results from an online crowdsourcing study (N = 80) show that the chosen visualisation technique significantly alters people’s fairness perception and that the presented scenario, as well as the participant’s gender and past education, influence perceived fairness.

Such primitives can be independent particles or particles that are physically connected via threads or pieces of cloth to form shapes in mid-air. However, initialization (i.e., placement of such primitives in their mid-air target locations) currently relies on either manual placement or specialized ad-hoc implementations, which limits their practical usage. We present ArticuLev, an integrated pipeline that deals with the identification, assembly and mid-air placement of levitated shape primitives. We designed ArticuLev with the physical properties of commonly used levitation primitives in mind. It enables experiences that seamlessly combine different primitives into meaningful structures (including fully articulated animated shapes) and supports various levitation display approaches (e.g., particles moving at high speed). In this paper, we describe our pipeline and demonstrate it with heterogeneous combinations of levitation primitives.},

	abstract     = {We propose a novel type of olfactory device that creates a stereo-smell experience, i.e., directional information about the location of an odor, by rendering the readings of external odor sensors as trigeminal sensations using electrical stimulation of the user's nasal septum. The key is that the sensations from the trigeminal nerve, which arise from nerve-endings in the nose, are perceptually fused with those of the olfactory bulb (the brain region that senses smells). As such, we propose that electrically stimulating the trigeminal nerve is an ideal candidate for stereo-smell augmentation/substitution that, unlike other approaches, does not require implanted electrodes in the olfactory bulb. To realize this, we engineered a self-contained device that users wear across their nasal septum. Our device outputs by stimulating the user's trigeminal nerve using electrical impulses with variable pulse-widths; and it inputs by sensing the user's inhalations using a photoreflector. It measures 10x23 mm and communicates with external gas sensors using Bluetooth. In our user study, we found the key electrical waveform parameters that enable users to feel an odor's intensity (absolute electric charge) and direction (phase order and net charge). In our second study, we demonstrated that participants were able to localize a virtual smell source in the room by using our prototype without any previous training. Using these insights, our device enables expressive trigeminal sensations and could function as an assistive device for people with anosmia, who are unable to smell.},

However, little is known about how commitment devices are used in the wild, and what aspects of commitment devices are related to goal achievements. In this paper, we explore a large-scale dataset from stickK, an online behavior change support system that provides both financial and social commitments. We characterize the patterns of behavior change goals (e.g., topics and commitment setting) and then perform a series of multilevel regression analyses on goal achievements. Our results reveal that successful goal achievements are largely dependent on the configuration of financial and social commitment devices, and a mixed commitment setting is considered beneficial. We discuss how our findings could inform the design of effective commitment devices, and how large-scale data can be leveraged to support data-driven goal elicitation and customization.},

Despite this player-centric orientation, players were rarely involved before and during the production to evaluate the emotional experience.

This poses challenges for training workers to rapidly master new machine operations and processes, i.e. machine tasks. Conventional in-person training is effective but requires time and effort of experts for each worker trained and not scalable. Recorded tutorials, such as video-based or augmented reality (AR), permit more efficient scaling. However, unlike in-person tutoring, existing recorded tutorials lack the ability to adapt to workers’ diverse experiences and learning behaviors. We present AdapTutAR, an adaptive task tutoring system that enables experts to record machine task tutorials via embodied demonstration and train learners with different AR tutoring contents adapting to each user’s characteristics. The adaptation is achieved by continually monitoring learners’ tutorial-following status and adjusting the tutoring content on-the-fly and in-situ.

We further find that these class-based orientations contribute to parent-teen tensions. For upper-middle-class families, tensions arise when parents insist that teens should use smartphones to get help with academic and enrichment activities and teens disagree about whether their phone-related activities align with this goal. In contrast, we find that conflict can occur in working-class families when teens use their smartphones to get assistance and parents interpret such activity as teens being lazy or not self-sufficient.

	abstract     = {For haptic guidance, vibrotactile feedback is a commonly-used mechanism, but requires users to interpret its complicated patterns especially in 3D guidance, which is not intuitive and increases their mental effort. Furthermore, for haptic guidance in virtual reality (VR), not only guidance performance but also realism should be considered. Since vibrotactile feedback interferes with and reduces VR realism, it may not be proper for VR haptic guidance. Therefore, we propose a wearable device, GuideBand, to provide intuitive 3D multilevel force guidance upon the forearm, which reproduces an effect that the forearm is pulled and guided by a virtual guider or telepresent person in VR. GuideBand uses three motors to pull a wristband at different force levels in 3D space. Such feedback usually requires much larger and heavier robotic arms or exoskeletons. We conducted a just-noticeable difference study to understand users’ force level distinguishability. Based on the results, we performed a study to verify that compared with state-of-the-art vibrotactile guidance, GuideBand is more intuitive, needs a lower level of mental effort, and achieves similar guidance performance. We further conducted a VR experience study to observe how users combine and complement visual and force guidance, and prove that GuideBand enhances realism in VR guidance.},

We identify several gaps between the toolkits’ capabilities and practitioner needs, highlighting areas requiring attention and future directions towards tooling that better support ‘fairness in practice.’},

HoloBar is a novel approach to ease the interaction with multi-level menus in immersive environments: with HoloBar, the hierarchical menu splits between the field of view (FoV) of the Head Mounted Display and the smartphone (SP). Command execution is based on around-the-FoV interaction with the SP, and touch input on the SP display. The HoloBar offers a unique combination of features, namely rapid mid-air activation, implicit selection of top-level items and preview of second-level items on the SP, ensuring rapid access to commands. In a first study we validate its activation method, which consists in bringing the SP within an activation distance from the FoV. In a second study, we compare the HoloBar to two alternatives, including the standard HoloLens menu. Results show that the HoloBar shortens each step of a multi-level menu interaction (menu activation, top-level item selection, second-level item selection and validation), with a high success rate. A follow-up study confirms that these results remain valid when compared with the two validation mechanisms of HoloLens (Air-Tap and clicker).},

This paper presents a 2x2 mixed factorial experiment that explores the effects of providing spatial information and system-generated guidance to task objects. It also investigates the effects of such guidance on the remote collaborator’s need for spatial information. Our results show that guidance increases performance and communication efficiency while reducing the need for spatial information, especially in unfamiliar environments.

	abstract     = {Virtual Reality (VR) holds the promise of immersing people in virtual worlds. However, initial work on the relationship between VR and disability suggests that VR is a body-centric technology that poses barriers for disabled users. We supplement this work with a theoretical analysis of immersive VR through the lens of Surrogate Body theory, a concept from media theory for the structured examination of interactive media in use. Leveraging Critical Disability Studies, particularly the theory of the Minority Body, we explore the assumptions about bodies inherent in VR, and we reflect on implications of these assumptions when disabled people engage with the technology. Our findings show that VR is an inherently ableist technology that assumes a ‘corporeal standard’ (i.e., an ‘ideal’, non-disabled human body), and fails to adequately accommodate disabled people. We conclude with implications for HCI research on VR, and discuss design approaches that foster inclusive technology development.},

In this paper, we present the results of a crowd-sourced study exploring preferences and perceived quality of recommendations that have been positioned as either human-curated or algorithmically generated. We observe that while participants initially prefer human recommenders, their actions suggest an indifference for recommendation source when evaluating visualization recommendations. The relevance of presented information (e.g., the presence of certain data fields) was the most critical factor, followed by a belief in the recommender’s ability to create accurate visualizations. Our findings suggest a general indifference towards the provenance of recommendations, and point to idiosyncratic definitions of visualization quality and trustworthiness that may not be captured by simple measures. We suggest that recommendation systems should be tailored to the information-foraging strategies of specific users.},

Our analysis produced a framework summarising the important elements of a facilitated reflective experience. The framework is intended to guide the design of technologies to support safety, connection, and reflection in scaffolding social emotional learning towards improved emotional behaviour for children.

After completing eight in-depth interviews, we found students had difficulty in finding opportunities that sparked their interest, contacting organizations, as well as keeping track of their hours for organizations such as service clubs or college Greek life. To solve these problems for students, we created VolunteerSpot: an app that allows high school and college students to easily find service opportunities at the tip of their finger. VolunteerSpot utilizes an interface for volunteers, where they can filter through service opportunities by category, and an interface for organizations, who can post job opportunities. The app employs a messaging feature for communication between groups, a review widget, and can filter service opportunities by category and proximity to the user. We hope that by creating VolunteerSpot, students can use our app to give back to their community and express gratitude in an easy and interactive way.},

While allowing novel forms of interactivity with partially-autonomous systems, these techniques could also foster the emergence of artworks not limited to experts. Hence, in this research we introduce the concept of meta-interactivity for compositional interfaces, which extends an individual’s capabilities by the translation of an effort into a proficiency. We study how this approach can be effective through the development of novel systems that enables novices to compose coherent musical pieces through the use of imagetic elements in a virtual environment.},

In manufacturing industries, the direct physical collaboration between workers and robots is already reality today. To understand how humans perceive this collaboration, investigations regarding the effect of different robot behaviors and the characteristics that influence the perception by humans are required. Existing findings on the effect of human attributes and human-like appearance of robots point out several possibilities that improve interactions between humans and robots. However, these studies predominantly focus on humanoid robots. With regard to the increasing number of industrial robots and the arising economic potential of automation, the objective of my research is to gain in-depth understanding of human perception of robot movement behaviors. Achieving this requires insights on possible and perceptible robot behaviors in the non-humanoid field, how they are perceived and how they can be mapped to acceptance by humans. Based on this understanding, resulting interactions can be improved by adapting relevant behavior to the individual’s preferences. In view of new technologies and possibilities, it might even be possible to use real time data to classify humans and let robots adapt their behavior automatically.},

This presents an opportunity to produce more effective SAR teleoperation interfaces in the context of therapy for autistic children. In this paper, I outline research for improving teleoperation interfaces of SARs through (1) analyzing current teleoperation usage, (2) interviewing teleoperators about their needs, and (3) implementing and evaluating varied designs for teleoperation interfaces.},

Restricting users in group decision-making can cause interpersonal conflicts and frustration. To overcome these aspects, my PhD research aims to articulate design principles to support social control. I specifically focus on distributing control across group members to support collaborative group decision-making and enhance social connectedness. To achieve this, I will design entertainment-oriented social control services for the car and the living room. Based on the exploration and designs for the car domain, I will transfer the gained knowledge to the living room, to verify and generalize my findings. This should support in drawing an overall conclusion for the design of general social control entertainment services.

	abstract     = {Explainability of AI systems is crucial to hold them accountable because they are increasingly becoming consequential in our lives by powering high-stakes decisions in domains like healthcare and law. When it comes to Explainable AI (XAI), understanding who interacts with the black-box of AI is just as important as “opening” it, if not more. Yet the discourse of XAI has been predominantly centered around the black-box, suffering from deficiencies in meeting user needs and exacerbating issues of algorithmic opacity. To address these issues, researchers have called for human-centered approaches to XAI. In this second CHI workshop on Human-centered XAI (HCXAI), we build on the success of the first installment from CHI 2021 to expand the conversation around XAI. We chart the domain and shape the HCXAI discourse with reflective discussions from diverse stakeholders. The goal of the second installment is to go beyond the black box and examine how human-centered perspectives in XAI can be operationalized at the conceptual, methodological, and technical levels. Encouraging holistic (historical, sociological, and technical) approaches, we put an emphasis on “operationalizing”, aiming to produce actionable frameworks, transferable evaluation methods, concrete design guidelines, and articulate a coordinated research agenda for XAI.},

	abstract     = {In the wake of the hype around big data, artificial intelligence, and “data-drivenness,” much attention has been paid to developing novel tools to capitalize upon the deluge of data being recorded and gathered automatically through IT systems. While much of this literature tends to overlook the data itself—sometimes even characterizing it as “data exhaust” that is readily available to be fed into algorithms, which will unlock the insights held within it—a growing body of literature has recently been directed at the (often intensive and skillful) work that goes into creating, collecting, managing, curating, analyzing, interpreting, and communicating data. These investigations detail the practices and processes involved in making data useful and meaningful so that aims of becoming ‘data-driven’ or ‘data-informed’ can become real. Further, In some cases, increased demands for data work have led to the formation of new occupations, whereas at other times data work has been added to the task portfolios of existing occupations and professions, occasionally affecting their core identity. Thus, the evolving forms of data work are requiring individual and organizational resources, new and re-tooled practices and tools, development of new competences and skills, and creation of new functions and roles. While differences exist across the global North and the global South experience of data work, such factors of data production remain paramount even as they exist largely for the benefit of the data-driven system [21, 32]. This one-day workshop will investigate existing and emerging tasks of data work. Further, participants will seek to understand data work as it impacts: individual data workers; occupations tasked with data work (existing and emerging); organizations (e.g. changing their skill-mix and infrastructuring to support data work); and teaching institutions (grappling with incorporation of data work into educational programs). Participants are required to submit a position paper or a case study drawn from their research to be reviewed and accepted by the organizing committee (submissions should be up to four pages in length). Upon acceptance, participants will read each other's paper, prepare to shortly present and respond to comments by two discussants and other participants. Subsequently, the workshop will focus on developing a set of core processes and tasks as well as an outline of a research agenda for a CHI-perspective on data work in the coming years.},

Given COVID-19 social distancing measures, the design of Meerkat adapts patterns of peer support to situations where the users are not co-located. To users who do not have available social support, the app provides a foundation to receive support from a community of volunteers who are social connections to other users.

The magnitude of deformation can be detected by measuring the resistance between a pair of electrodes. By adjusting the parameters of the lattice structure, a soft sensor with high flexibility of shape design and adjustable local softness can be realized. In addition, by inserting non-conductive structures into the sensor structure, external wires can be consolidated in one place. We present a design and fabrication pipeline, and investigate the fundamental characteristics of several patterns of sensors. We also show several applications that demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method.},

Therefore, users are too preoccupied with speaking phrases correctly, and the advantage of VUIs, which can be used without awareness of the operation method, has not been fully demonstrated. To address these issues, we propose KaraokeVUI, which is a VUI help tool for supporting voice operation with feedback by displaying spoken words through filling in the blanks or overlaying on phrases, just like on a karaoke screen.

While prioritizing usability issues has long been attended by the HCI community, the specific problem of this research is new and has never been addressed. To deal with this challenge, we conducted five focus groups with HCI professionals and identified a set of prioritization criteria. We then used those criteria to prioritize the UI items for future empirical evaluation of their preferred directionality. In addition to these findings, we provide some insights from our experience of using focus groups for the prioritization task.},

Inspired by contextual design, We virtually observed and interviewed eight persons during and after participation in online worship services. We identified a field of tension between faith, everyday life, individuality, and community. The data suggests that current online worship service systems do not account for believers’ needs for community, faith, or extraordinariness. We discuss opportunities for future research and design, and aim to contribute to the understanding of online worship service experiences and the design of technology-mediated religious experiences.},

	abstract     = {Home assistants are becoming a widespread product, but they mostly come as a compact device and offer very few customization and personalization features, which often leads to dissatisfaction. With the technological advancements, these systems are becoming more adaptable to the users’ needs and can better imitate a human personality. To achieve that efficiently, understanding how different users envision their desired assistant is crucial. To identify people’s customization and personalization preferences and their desired personality for a home assistant, we designed a set of storyboards depicting a variety of possible features in a domestic setting and conducted a user study (), including a series of semi-structured interviews. Our quantitative results suggest that users prefer an agent which is highly agreeable and has higher conscientiousness and emotional stability. Furthermore, we discuss users’ customization and personalization preferences for a home assistant, which could be considered when designing the future generation of home assistants.},

Personalised recommendations can help users to identify therapy tasks that they find most enjoyable or helpful, thus boosting their engagement with the service and optimising the extent to which it helps them to feel better. Using a dataset containing 23,476 ratings collected from 973 players of a mental health therapy game, this work demonstrates how collaborative filtering algorithms can predict how much a user will benefit from a new therapy task with greater accuracy than a simpler baseline algorithm that predicts the average rating for a task, adjusted for the biases of the specific user and specific task. Collaborative filtering algorithms (matrix factorisation and k-nearest neighbour) outperform this baseline with a 6.5-8.3% improvement in mean absolute error (MAE) and context-aware collaborative filtering algorithms (factorisation machines) outperform with a 7.8-8.8% improvement in MAE. These results suggest that recommender systems could be a useful tool for tailoring recommendations of new therapy tasks to a user based on a combination of their past preferences, the ratings of similar users, and their current context. This scalable approach to personalisation – which does not require a human therapist to always be in-the-loop – could play an important role in improving engagement and outcomes in digital mental health therapies.},

They can look at images of the product, read reviews, make comparisons with other products, do research online, read expert reviews, and more. Voice shopping (purchasing items via a Voice assistant such as Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant) is different. Voice introduces novel challenges as the communication channel is limited in terms of the amount of information people can and are willing to absorb. Because of this, the system should choose the single most effective nugget of information to help the customer, and present the information succinctly. In this paper we report on a within-subject user study (N = 24), in which we employed three template-based methods that use information from customer reviews, product attributes and search relevance signals to generate helpful supporting information. Our results suggest that: (1) supporting information from customer reviews significantly improves participants perception of system effectiveness (helping them make good decisions); (2) supporting information based on search relevance signals improves user perception of system transparency (providing insight into how the system works). We discuss the implications of our findings for providing supporting information for customers shopping by Voice.},

To address this, we propose WebTransceiVR, an asymmetric collaboration toolkit which when integrated into a VR application, allows multiple non-VR users to share the virtual space of the VR user. It allows external users to enter and be part of the VR application’s space through standard web browsers on mobile and computers. These external users can explore and interact with the other users, the VR scene as well as the VR user. WebTransceiVR also includes a cloud-based streaming solution that enables many passive spectators to view the scene through any of the active cameras.

Reflective thinking, however, demands extra cognitive efforts, resources and skills, and therefore could deter people from taking further steps to question information encountered online. In this paper, we proposed a digital nudging tool for supporting critical reflection of video contents based on concept mapping and peer commenting mechanisms. The proposed tool, DeepThinkingMap, aims to promote people’s understanding and reflection of video content via interface features that foster the disclosure of personal conceptualization and transparency of personal beliefs about the video. By seeing how peers conceptualize and reflect about the video content, the concepts and comments made available to people could potentially serve as a ”thinking nudge,” allowing individuals to reap in-depth thoughts about the video otherwise inaccessible to them. Through a proof-of-concept controlled evaluation, we found that seeing peer thoughts through DeepThinkingMap significantly increased content comprehension, and fostered greater efforts for reflection in comparison to the baseline of receiving no nudge. The study contributes to understanding the socio-technical-cognitive mechanisms and the design space of social nudging that may be utilized to support reflection and critical thinking toward high-stakes information.},

Conformal deposition improves the quality of the 3D printed parts through support-less printing and curved layer deposition. However, such multi-axis 3D printing is inaccessible to many individuals due to high costs and technical complexities. Furthermore, the limited GUI support for conformal slicers creates an additional barrier for users. To open multi-axis 3D printing up to more makers and researchers, we present a cheap and accessible way to upgrade a regular 3D printer to 5 axes.

This study aims to help those who did not receive the proper training in drawing at the time and as a result remain at that level of drawing. First, through 12 drawing workshop sessions, we condensed 2 prominent art education books into 10 core drawing skills. Second, we designed and implemented a novel interactive system that helps the user repeatedly train these skills in the 5 stages of drawing a nice car in an accurate perspective. Our novel interactive technique, Tick'n'Draw, inspired by the drawing habits of experts, provides friendly guidance so that the user does not get lost in the many steps of perceptual and perspective drawing. Third, through a pilot test, we found that our system is quick to learn, easy to use, and can potentially improve real-world drawing abilities with continued use.},

In this paper, we propose an interactive VR system engaging audiences to experience and understand the connotation of Hua'er performance. Based on an online survey with the public and in-depth interviews with Hua'er experts, we derive a set of design requirements for generating embodied storytelling and interactive experience in VR. Accordingly, we design “Hua'er and the Youth” (HY) that integrates three methods (virtual avatar, participatory performance, and game-based knowledge acquisition) and conduct a between-subjects user study to compare HY with the Comparison system. The results suggest that our methods significantly improved audience's interactive experience, knowledge level and the awareness of ICH safeguarding.},

Unlike other private attributes such as demographic attributes, an intention oftentimes leads to a near-future behavior. Prior knowledge about such future behaviors can be seen as “actionable intelligence” and constitutes a significantly bigger risk to users’ privacy than knowledge of non-behavioral attributes. In this paper, we present a novel, multidisciplinary methodology for behavioral-intention inference. Using Bayesian-Networks, we model a behavioral intention using a set of causes that influence the intention’s formation, a set of effects that are caused by the intention, and various dependency relations within and between those sets. Unlike the methodologies used in prior attribute-inference works, which are oftentimes tailored to a single target attribute, our methods can be applied to different types of intentions from a diverse set of domains as we demonstrate by applying our model to multiple real-world intention-inference tasks.},

To explore needs and practices for accessing relevant and reliable information about disability and sexuality, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 5 participants. Results show that there are several topics which participants thought should be better explored in the context of disability and sexuality, but most available sex education resources are not inclusive. Moreover, people with disabilities, especially when young or less used to self-advocate for their own needs, face difficulties engaging in meaningful conversations around sexuality.

Next, a within-subjects user testing study was performed to compare two functional prototypes that differed only in their structure: one replicated the existing website structure, whereas the other implemented the structure produced by card sort data analysis. Results showed that participants using the redesigned structure had significantly better usability metrics (first click success rate, task time, SEQ score and SUS score) compared to when interacting with the existing structure. These findings provide support for the validity of the open card sorting method for the design of website information structures.},

	abstract     = {With the development of social media, various rumors can be easily spread on the Internet and such rumors can have serious negative effects on society. Thus, it has become a critical task for social media platforms to deal with suspected rumors. However, due to the lack of effective tools, it is often difficult for platform administrators to analyze and validate rumors from a large volume of information on a social media platform efficiently. We have worked closely with social media platform administrators for four months to summarize their requirements of identifying and analyzing rumors, and further proposed an interactive visual analytics system, RumorLens, to help them deal with the rumor efficiently and gain an in-depth understanding of the patterns of rumor spreading. RumorLens integrates natural language processing (NLP) and other data processing techniques with visualization techniques to facilitate interactive analysis and validation of suspected rumors. We propose well-coordinated visualizations to provide users with three levels of details of suspected rumors: an overview displays both spatial distribution and temporal evolution of suspected rumors; a projection view leverages a metaphor-based glyph to represent each suspected rumor and further enable users to gain a quick understanding of their overall characteristics and similarity with each other; a propagation view visualizes the dynamic spreading details of a suspected rumor with a novel circular visualization design, and facilitates interactive analysis and validation of rumors in a compact manner. By using a real-world dataset collected from Sina Weibo, one case study with a domain expert is conducted to evaluate RumorLens. The results demonstrated the usefulness and effectiveness of our approach.},

VirGuqin was developed using a low-cost motion tracking device and was tested in a museum. 89% of 308 participants expressed an increase in interest in learning Guqin after using our system. MRGuqin was developed as a mixed reality learning environment to reduce the entry barrier to Guqin, and was tested by 16 participants, allowing them to learn Guqin significantly faster and perform better than the current practice.

	abstract     = {Recently, digital scribe systems have been gaining popularity as a possible work-around solution to the Electronic Medical Record (EMR) documentation burden that affects many physicians. The proposed system would automate the clinical summary physicians take by capturing and extracting the patient-physician conversation during the consultation. While promising in concept, how this system would apply to real-world use and its limitations are still not well understood. To examine these issues, we designed a digital scribe prototype to generate notes of different qualities ranging from the reality of current state-of-the-art technology to the potential of future implementations. We conducted a ”Wizard of Oz” study with 24 primary care physicians using our digital scribe prototype in 4 simulated medical encounters followed by a semi-structured interview. This exploratory study provides an understanding of physicians’ interaction with digitally scribed notes, their perceptions on note quality, their perceived workflow impact and several directions for improvements.},

Here, we study potential goals and benefits of warm-up games, and explore opportunities for technology inclusion through investigating a collection of warm-up games gathered: online, from a survey of online warm-up games curated, described, and used by Physical Education teachers; and in person, from an ongoing design research work as part of a technology-supported circus training course. Further, in the context of the latter, we conducted explorative design interventions, augmenting a range of the warm-up games with wearable technology. Our work surfaces major goals and benefits of warm-up games, which can be broadly classified as preparing participants physically, socially, and mentally. We also show how the inclusion of open-ended technology can support these goals and discuss broader opportunities for technology inclusion in warm-up games.},

Our data analysis highlights their experiences from a holistic perspective that reclaims the primacy of the body and acknowledges the entanglement of the physical and the psychosocial. Participants’ design concepts show how design can come close the body to make space for menopause experiences, recognising and transforming them. We discuss how HCI can actively engage with the body to promote appreciation for it during menopause, and call for design that accompanies people in resisting the medicalisation of menopause as an enactment of social justice in everyday life.},

Older adults are one group for whom making agendas are being pursued, with envisioned outcomes such as supporting agency and well-being. However, research on making and DIY with older adults typically study individuals who are already engaged in making practices or bring individuals in to a technology environment that has already been created. In this paper, we study the older adult-driven formation of a makerspace in an independent living community. Through an ethnographically-informed approach, we studied the ways that individuals considered appropriate allocation of resources towards a makerspace, scoped activities, evaluated goals, and made trade-offs. Our analysis is centered around describing the way that this makerspace formed as well as three ways that individuals made sense of the makerspace as the planning unfolded: the openness of a space that promises to cater to interests of the population; the promise of a makerspace to involve more residents in technology, but the need to obscure the technology to make it appealing; and a valuation of the return on investment for limited financial and space resources. Our discussion contributes to supporting and studying early adoption of technology by older adults, complicates visions of “making for all,” and presents considerations regarding the often under-specified community of a makerspace.},

We propose making un-use as an epistemological perspective to ‘human-artefact engagements’; one that emphasises un-users as enactors of open-ended, temporarily evolving, and creative activities. We depict making un-use as transformational acts, and discuss epistemological and designerly consequences of making un-use to shed light on a not yet explored site of inquiry and a design space that is about to evolve: a design space for making and makers of un-use.},

We first examine the impact of walking on performance of these touches, noting no significant differences in accuracy or speed, then feed our study data into a multi-objective optimization process in order to design keyboard layouts (for both five and ten keys) capable of supporting rapid, accurate, comfortable, and unambiguous typing. A final study tests these layouts against QWERTY baselines and reports performance improvements of up to 10.45% WPM and 39.44% WER when users type while walking.},

As part of research to design a Safety Setting application for older adults with memory loss or mild cognitive impairment (MCI), we use a scenario-based participatory design. Our study builds on previous findings that couples’ approach to memory loss was characterized by a desire for flexibility and choice, and an embrace of role uncertainty. We find that couples don't want a system that fundamentally alters their relationship and are looking to maximize self-surveillance competence and minimize loss of autonomy for their partners. All desire Safety Settings to maintain their mutual safety rather than designating one partner as the target of oversight. Couples are open to more rigorous surveillance if they have control over what types of activities trigger various levels of oversight.},

We identified 13 classes of digital security and privacy advice in these guides. To understand whether this advice influences protesters, we surveyed 167 BLM protesters. Respondents reported an array of security and privacy concerns, and their concerns were magnified when considering fellow protesters. While most respondents reported being aware of, and following, certain advice (e.g., choosing a strong phone passcode), many were unaware of key advice like using end-to-end encrypted messengers and disabling biometric phone unlocking. Our results can guide future advice and technologies to help novice protesters protect their security and privacy.},

Many representation techniques also require significant manual data annotation efforts. This paper presents Screen2Vec, a new self-supervised technique for generating representations in embedding vectors of GUI screens and components that encode all of the above GUI features without requiring manual annotation using the context of user interaction traces. Screen2Vec is inspired by the word embedding method Word2Vec, but uses a new two-layer pipeline informed by the structure of GUIs and interaction traces and incorporates screen- and app-specific metadata. Through several sample downstream tasks, we demonstrate Screen2Vec’s key useful properties: representing between-screen similarity through nearest neighbors, composability, and capability to represent user tasks.},

We designed and implemented two in-vehicle interventions based on proven psychotherapy interventions. Whereas the first intervention uses mindfulness exercises while driving, the second intervention induces positive emotions through music. Ten ordinary and healthy commuters completed 313 of these interventions on their daily drives over two months. We collected drivers’ immediate and post-driving feedback for each intervention and conducted interviews with the drivers after the end of the study. The results show that both interventions have improved drivers’ well-being. While the participants rated the music intervention very positively, the reception of the mindfulness intervention was more ambivalent.},

PredictMe combines belief elicitation with traditional visualization interactions to support mixed analysis styles. In a comparative study, we investigated how these affordances impact participants’ cognition. Results show that PredictMe prompts participants to incorporate their working knowledge more frequently in queries. Participants were more likely to attend to discrepancies between their mental models and the data. However, those same participants were also less likely to engage in interactions associated with exploration, and ultimately inspected fewer visualizations and made fewer discoveries. The results suggest that belief elicitation may moderate exploratory behaviors, instead nudging users to be more deliberate in their analysis. We discuss the implications for visualization design.},

In this paper, we draw together perspectives and commentary from HCI, design, privacy and data protection, and legal research communities, using the language and strategies of “dark patterns” to perform an interaction criticism reading of three different types of consent banners. Our analysis builds upon designer, interface, user, and social context lenses to raise tensions and synergies that arise together in complex, contingent, and conflicting ways in the act of designing consent banners. We conclude with opportunities for transdisciplinary dialogue across legal, ethical, computer science, and interactive systems scholarship to translate matters of ethical concern into public policy.},

Our results provide evidence for the usefulness of this capability, showing that, for example, 81% of people who used the system successfully thought that future virtual conferences should include a tool with similar functionality.

Furthermore, the artefact’s dimensions should be balanced within the design itself, with the user, and the context, but there is a trade-off between the perceived safety and ergonomics; and (3) the designed embodied passwords can be recalled for at least a week, with participants creating unique passwords which were reproduced consistently.},

In such cases, designers may need to intervene and de-bias these estimations, or otherwise inform viewers about differences between statistical and visual trend estimations. We propose data-driven mark orientation as a solution in such cases, where the directionality of marks in the scatterplot guide participants when visual estimation is otherwise unclear or ambiguous. Through a set of laboratory studies, we investigate trend estimation across a variety of data distributions and mark directionalities, and find that data-driven mark orientation can help resolve ambiguities in visual trend estimates.},

Cognitive demands and both exertion-based and controller-based physical demands were perceived as lowest in situations where reward was high and effort was low (boredom), moderate when reward and effort were balanced (flow), and highest when the reward was low and effort was high (frustration). Surprisingly, player response times to a secondary task showed the greatest improvement when playing the frustrating video game condition. We interpret this latter finding as evidence of an observed task-switching effect: players initially tried to master the game's over-challenging primary task before giving up and, instead, diverted attention toward a secondary in-game task that required less effort and thus, gave greater attentional rewards to the player. The implications of this cognitive offloading are discussed.},

However, several disciplines are often necessary when exploring technologies for the construction of expressive garments (e.g. garments that respond to their environment), creating a barrier for fashion designers that has limited their ability to leverage new technologies. To help overcome this barrier, we designed and deployed Brookdale, a prototyping system for wearable technology consisting of new plug-and-play hardware that can be programmed using drag-and-drop software. Brookdale was created using a 24-week participatory design process with 17 novice fashion-tech designers. At the end of the 24 week process, designers showcased their Brookdale-enhanced garment collections at an avant-garde fashion-tech runway show in New York City. We report on the experiences, outcomes, and lessons learned throughout this process, and describe results from interviews with the fashion-tech designers 16 weeks after the fashion show, demonstrating the lasting positive impact of Brookdale.},

To alleviate these shortcomings, we propose : a fabrication pipeline and interfacing concept to magnetically connect a 3D-printed object equipped with passive sensing structures to conventional sensing electronics. To this end, utilizes ferromagnetic and conductive 3D-printed structures, printable in a single pass on standard printers. We further present a proof-of-concept capacitive sensing board that enables easy and robust magnetic assembly to quickly create interactive 3D-printed objects. We evaluate by assessing the robustness and quality of the connection and demonstrate its broad applicability by a series of example applications.},

Thus, it is important to focus on both the environment and the needs of target groups that have not been sufficiently considered in the past. In this paper, we present the findings from a qualitative study (N=11) of public attitude on hypothetical implementation scenarios for AVs. Our results indicate that people are aware of the benefits of shared mobility for the environment and society, and are generally open to using it. However, 1) emotional factors mitigate this openness and 2) security concerns were expressed by female participants. We recommend that identified concerns must be addressed to allow AVs fully exploiting their benefits for society and environment.},

Therefore, we conducted a study with 18 participants to investigate text presentation type and location in VR. We compared world-fixed, edge-fixed, and head-fixed text locations. Texts were displayed using Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) or as a paragraph. We found that RSVP is a promising presentation type for reading short texts displayed in edge-fixed or head-fixed location in VR. The paragraph presentation type using world-fixed or edge-fixed location is promising for reading long text if movement in the virtual environment is not required.

Findings from our design ethnography reveal four thematic qualities of their relationships to thingcare: Care Spectacle, Care Liminality, Ontological Braiding, and Care Condition. Using these themes as touchstones, we co-speculated to produce four speculative IoT concepts to explore what care as a design ethic might look like for IoT and reflect on nascent opportunities and challenges for domestic IoT design.

We interviewed ten information workers asking about their tab management strategies and walk through each open tab on their work computers four times over two weeks. We uncovered competing pressures pushing for keeping tabs open (ranging from interaction to emotional costs) versus pushing for closing them (such as limited attention and resources). We then surveyed 103 participants to estimate the frequencies of these pressures at scale. Finally, we developed design implications for future browser interfaces that can better support managing these pressures.},

We find that the level of agreement between people and a model on decision-making tasks that people have high confidence in significantly affects reliance on the model if people receive no information about the model’s performance, but this impact will change after aggregate-level model performance information becomes available. Furthermore, the influence of high confidence human-model agreement on people’s reliance on a model is moderated by people’s confidence in cases where they disagree with the model.

The second, in the home of physically inactive participants, served to identify which effects could support PA adherence. Our findings show that movement sonification based on metaphors led to changes in body perception (e.g., feeling strong) and PA (e.g., repetitions) in both populations, but effects could differ according to the existing PA-level. We discuss principles for metaphor-based sonification design to foster PA.},

We designed the ThroughHand interaction to utilize the potential of the human tactile sense that spatially registers both sides of the hand with respect to each other. ThroughHand allows interaction with multiple objects by enabling users to perceive the objects using the palm while providing a touch input space on the back of the same hand. A user study verified that ThroughHand enables users to locate stimuli on the palm with a margin of error of approximately 13&nbsp;mm and effectively provides a real-time 2D interaction experience for users with visual impairments.},

With a multi-method qualitative approach (including digital ethnography and in-depth interviews), we empirically studied how people appropriate existing technologies and adapt their offline practices to play tabletop games remotely. We identify three themes that describe people's game and social experience during remote play: creating a shared tabletop environment (shared space), enabling a collective understanding (shared information and awareness), and facilitating a communal temporal experience (shared time).

Our findings indicate that commercial self-care apps portray themselves as “future creating” tools for individual self-discovery, but they also create narratives that propagate an overly simplistic, individualistic and potentially harmful view of mental distress.

The approach leverages the large number of distinct user contexts accessible through crowdsourcing to efficiently source diverse context and perceptual preference data. The insights gathered through this method complement emerging design guidance and sample-limited lab-based studies. The utility of the method is illustrated by re-examining the design challenge of adapting AR text content to the user’s environment.

In other words, it requires us, the CHI community, to generate this knowledge by studying representative participant samples. To find out to what extent CHI participant samples are from Western societies, we analyzed papers published in the CHI proceedings between 2016-2020. Our findings show that 73% of CHI study findings are based on Western participant samples, representing less than 12% of the world’s population. Furthermore, we show that most participant samples at CHI tend to come from industrialized, rich, and democratic countries with generally highly educated populations. Encouragingly, recent years have seen a slight increase in non-Western samples and those that include several countries.

In this work, we shift the focus to how the internal mechanisms of an app can support user agency, taking the popular YouTube mobile app as a test case. From a survey of 120 U.S. users, we find that autoplay and recommendations primarily undermine sense of agency, while playlists and search support it. From 13 co-design sessions, we find that when users have a specific intention for how they want to use YouTube they prefer interfaces that support greater agency.

We report two empirical studies of users’ experiences interacting with visuo-haptic content on their phones to 1) study participants’ preferences for ten design principles for HEs and 2) measure the added value of juicy haptics, implemented as HEs, on player experience in a game.

The ever-growing reliance of users with disability on mobile apps further underscores the need for accessible software in this domain. Existing automated accessibility assessment techniques primarily aim to detect violations of predefined guidelines, thereby produce a massive amount of accessibility warnings that often overlook the way software is actually used by users with disability. This paper presents a novel, high-fidelity form of accessibility testing for Android apps, called Latte, that automatically reuses tests written to evaluate an app’s functional correctness to assess its accessibility as well. Latte first extracts the use case corresponding to each test, and then executes each use case in the way disabled users would, i.e., using assistive services. Our empirical evaluation on real-world Android apps demonstrates Latte’s effectiveness in detecting substantially more useful defects than prior techniques.},

However, not much is known about how these settings influence use, nor how to design for them. We analyse 233 YouTube videos of VR Fails to: (1) understand when breakdowns occur, and (2) reveal how the seams between VR use and the social and physical setting emerge. The videos show a variety of fails, including users flailing, colliding with surroundings, and hitting spectators. They also suggest causes of the fails, including fear, sensorimotor mismatches, and spectator participation. We use the videos as inspiration to generate design ideas. For example, we discuss more flexible boundaries between the real and virtual world, ways of involving spectators, and interaction designs to help overcome fear. Based on the findings, we further discuss the ‘moment of breakdown’ as an opportunity for designing engaging and enhanced VR experiences.},

	abstract     = {A jury of one’s peers is a prominent way to adjudicate disputes and is increasingly used in participatory governance online. The fairness of this approach rests on the assumption that juries are consistent: that the same jury would hand down similar judgments to similar cases. However, prior literature suggests that social influence would instead cause early interactions to cascade into different judgments for similar cases. In this paper, we report an online experiment that changes participants’ pseudonyms as they appear to collaborators, temporarily masking a jury’s awareness that they have deliberated together before. This technique allows us to measure consistency by reconvening the same jury on similar cases. Counter to expectation, juries are equally consistent as individuals, a result that is “good for democracy.” But this consistency arises in part due to group polarization, as consensus develops by hardening initial majority opinions. Furthermore, we find that aggregating groups’ perspectives without deliberation erodes consistency.},

Using surveys and interviews, we investigated students’ knowledge about the autograder and their attitudes. We observed that misalignment between folk theories about how the autograder worked and how it actually worked could lead to suboptimal answer construction strategies. Students overestimated the autograder’s probability of marking correct answers as wrong, and estimates of this probability were associated with dissatisfaction and perceptions of unfairness. Many participants expressed a need for additional instruction on how to cater to the autograder. From these findings, we propose guidelines for incorporating imperfect short answer autograders into classroom in a manner that is considerate of students’ needs.},

	abstract     = {Live streaming is gaining popularity across diverse application domains in recent years. A core part of the experience is streamer-viewer interaction, which has been mainly text-based. Recent systems explored extending viewer interaction to include visual elements with richer expression and increased engagement. However, understanding expressive visual inputs becomes challenging with many viewers, primarily due to the relative lack of structure in visual input. On the other hand, adding rigid structures can limit viewer interactions to narrow use cases or decrease the expressiveness of viewer inputs. To facilitate the sensemaking of many visual inputs while retaining the expressiveness or versatility of viewer interactions, we introduce a visual input management framework (VIMF) and a system, VisPoll, that help streamers specify, aggregate, and visualize many visual inputs. A pilot evaluation indicated that VisPoll can expand the types of viewer interactions. Our framework provides insights for designing scalable and expressive visual communication for live streaming.},

Addressing this gap, we conducted research with two predominantly Black churches to explore health promotion design opportunities. We used photovoice, a research method where participants led their own data collection and analysis. Participants provided nuanced descriptions of the racial and ethnic identities of their communities, and how church history and aspirations for the future impacted these identities. Our findings characterize tensions between tradition and ‘modernization,’ implications for technology design, and the need for a temporal approach to understanding communities.

In efforts to simplify the challenging fabrication and enrich the design space of this dessert, we present Flower Jelly Printer: a printing device and design software for digitally fabricating flower jellies. Our design software lets users play with parameters and preview the resulting forms until achieving their desired shapes. We also developed slit injection printing that directly injects colored jelly into a base jelly, and shared several design examples to show the breadth of design possibilities. Finally, the user study with novice and experienced users demonstrates that our system benefits creators of all experience levels by iterative design and precise fabrication. We hope to enable more people to design and create their own flower jellies while expanding access and the design space for digitally fabricated foods.},

After conducting interviews to understand blind or low vision (BLV) users’ current emoji input experiences, we developed Voicemoji, which (1) outputs relevant emojis in response to voice commands, and (2) provides context-sensitive emoji suggestions through speech output. We also conducted a multi-stage evaluation study with six BLV participants from the United States and six BLV participants from China, finding that Voicemoji significantly reduced entry time by 91.2% and was preferred by all participants over the Apple iOS keyboard.

To facilitate the divergence and convergence of the ideation process, MetaMap provides 1) sample images based on keyword association and color filtering; 2) example-based exploration in semantics, color, and shape dimensions; and 3) thinking path tracking and idea recording. We conduct a within-subject study with 24 design enthusiasts by taking a Pinterest-like interface as the baseline.

Through a systematic survey of neural network games (n = 38), we identified the dominant interaction metaphors and AI interaction patterns in these games. In addition, we applied existing human-AI interaction guidelines to further shed light on player-AI interaction in the context of AI-infused systems. Our core finding is that AI as play can expand current notions of human-AI interaction, which are predominantly productivity-based. In particular, our work suggests that game and UX designers should consider flow to structure the learning curve of human-AI interaction, incorporate discovery-based learning to play around with the AI and observe the consequences, and offer users an invitation to play to explore new forms of human-AI interaction.},

Because these apps provide convenience and other benefits, as one participant put it, “there is a very fine line” that marks the divide between feeling empowered in the use of technology and coping with the discomfort and creepiness arising from invasive app behavior. Participants consistently expressed being resigned to disclose data even as they accepted personal responsibility for their own privacy.

User reviews include insights that are useful for app evolution. However, with the increase in the amount of received reviews, manually analyzing them is tedious and time-consuming, especially when searching for accessibility reviews. The goal of this paper is to support the automated identification of accessibility in user reviews, to help technology professionals in prioritizing their handling, and thus, creating more inclusive apps. Particularly, we design a model that takes as input accessibility user reviews, learns their keyword-based features, in order to make a binary decision, for a given review, on whether it is about accessibility or not. The model is evaluated using a total of 5,326 mobile app reviews. The findings show that (1) our model can accurately identify accessibility reviews, outperforming two baselines, namely keyword-based detector and a random classifier; (2) our model achieves an accuracy of 85% with relatively small training dataset; however, the accuracy improves as we increase the size of the training dataset.},

The approach is based on two key insights: 1) all games have 3 types of data streams: video, audio, and controller I/O, that can be analyzed in real-time to detect game events, and 2) a small number of user interface design patterns are reused across most games, so that event detectors can be reused effectively. We developed an open-source HapticSeer framework and implemented several real-time event detectors for commercial PC and VR games. We validated system correctness and real-time performance, and discuss feedback from several haptics developers that used the HapticSeer framework to integrate research and commercial haptic devices.},

Now, idol groups are struggling in the transition of such events to computer-mediated communication because these events had emphasized meeting face-to-face over communicating, as we can infer from their length of time. I anticipated that investigating this emerging transition would provide implications because their communication has a unique characteristic that is distinct from well-studied situations, such as workplace communication and intimate relationships. Therefore, I first conducted a quantitative survey to develop a precise understanding of the transition, and based on its results, had semi-structured interviews with idol fans about their perceptions of the transition. The survey revealed distinctive approaches, including one where fans gathered at a venue but were isolated from the idol member by an acrylic plate and talked via a video call. Then the interviews not only provided answers to why such an approach would be reasonable but also suggested the existence of a large gap between conventional offline events and emerging online events in their perceptions. Based on the results, I discussed how we can develop interaction techniques to support this transition and how we can apply it to other situations outside idol culture, such as computer-mediated performing arts.},

Our results demonstrate that intrinsic meeting characteristics such as size, length, time, and type, significantly correlate with the extent to which people multitask, and multitasking can lead to both positive and negative outcomes.

They are often at the forefront, witnessing incidents, dealing with the consequences, and helping children handle the technology-related risks. However, little is reported about teachers’ lived classroom experiences and their challenges in this regard. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 21 Canadian elementary school teachers to understand the risks teachers witness children aged 10–13 facing on digital media, teachers’ mitigation strategies, and how prepared teachers are to help children. Our results show that teachers regularly help children deal with digital risks outside of teaching official curriculum, ranging from minor privacy violations to severe cases of cyberbullying. Most issues reported by teachers were the result of typical behaviours which became risky because they took place over digital media. We use the results to highlight implications for how elementary schools address digital security and privacy.},

However, despite strong evidence for its efficacy as a listening exercise, existing shadowing systems do not adequately support listening-focused practice, especially in self-regulated learning environments with no external feedback. To bridge this gap, we introduce Computer-Assisted Shadowing Trainer (CAST), a shadowing system that makes self-regulation easy and effective through four novel design elements — (i) in-the-moment highlights for tracking and visualizing progress, (ii) contextual blurring for inducing self-reflection on misheard words, (iii) self-listening comparators for post-practice self-evaluation, and (iv) adjustable pause-handles for self-paced practice. We base CAST on a formative user study (N=15) that provides fresh empirical grounds on the needs and challenges of shadowers. We validate our design through a summative evaluation (N=12) that shows learners can successfully self-regulate their shadowing practice with CAST while retaining focus on listening.},

We first conducted a user study (N=12) to understand users’ ability to control their waist. We found that users could easily discriminate eight shifting directions and two rotating orientations, and quickly confirm actions by returning to the original position (quick return). We developed a design space with eight gestures for waist interaction based on the results and implemented an IMU-based real-time system. Using a hierarchical machine learning model, our system could recognize waist gestures at an accuracy of 97.5%. Finally, we conducted a second user study (N=12) for usability testing in both real-world scenarios and virtual reality settings. Our usability study indicated that HulaMove significantly reduced interaction time by 41.8% compared to a touch screen method, and greatly improved users’ sense of presence in the virtual world. This novel technique provides an additional input method when users’ eyes or hands are busy, accelerates users’ daily operations, and augments their immersive experience in the virtual world.},

However, we show through an investigation of 900 crowdsourced initializations that such quality control strategies are inadequate for this task in two major ways: first, the high level of redundancy in these methods (e.g., averaging multiple responses to reduce error) is unnecessary, as 23% of crowdsourced initializations perform just as well as the gold-standard initialization. Second, even nearly perfect initializations can lead to degraded long-term performance due to the complexity of object tracking. Considering these findings, we evaluate novel approaches for automatically selecting bounding boxes to re-query, and introduce Smart Replacement, an efficient method that decides whether to use the crowdsourced replacement initialization.},

Existing charting tools usually determine the layout parameters using predefined heuristics, producing sub-optimal layouts. People can repeatedly adjust multiple parameters (e.g., chart size, gap) to achieve visually appealing layouts. However, this trial-and-error process is unsystematic and time-consuming, without a guarantee of improvement. To address this issue, we develop Layout Quality Quantifier (LQ2), a machine learning model that learns to score chart layouts from paired crowdsourcing data. Combined with optimization techniques, LQ2 recommends layout parameters that improve the charts’ layout quality. We apply LQ2 on bar charts and conduct user studies to evaluate its effectiveness by examining the quality of layouts it produces. Results show that LQ2 can generate more visually appealing layouts than both laypeople and baselines. This work demonstrates the feasibility and usages of quantifying human preferences and aesthetics for chart layouts.},

Quantitative results show that while the real-world VR representation results in higher sense of presence, no significant differences in user experience and trust towards the AV itself were found. However, interview data shows that participants focused on different experiential and perceptual aspects in each of the prototype representations. These differences are linked to spatial awareness and perceived realism of the AV behaviour and its context, affecting in turn how participants assess trust and the eHMI.

Using a between-subjects protocol, 58 participants taught a conversational agent about rock classification using a learning-by-teaching platform, the Curiosity Notebook. While all agents were curious and enthusiastic, the style of humour was manipulated such that the agent either expressed an affiliative style, a self-defeating style, or no humour. Results demonstrate that affiliative humour can significantly increase motivation and effort, while self-defeating humour, although enhancing effort, negatively impacts enjoyment. Findings further highlight the importance of understanding learner characteristics when using humour.},

Knowledge about potential recording would enable users to avoid accessing such areas or not to disclose certain information. We built two prototypes: a) a mobile application capable of detecting smart devices in the environment using a thermal camera, and b) VR mockups of six scenarios where PriView might be useful (e.g., a rental apartment). In both, we included several types of visualisation. Results of our lab study (N=24) indicate that users prefer simple, permanent indicators while wishing for detailed visualisations on demand.

This paper examines how initiators of smart technology insert their vision of the good life into households, and how these technologies exert power over the residents. Through a thematic analysis of interviews with five households, we consider Foucault’s theory on disciplinary power to examine how smart home technologies shape the experience of the home by shifting the flow of information and thereby reify power structures. Results indicate that the implementation of smart technology can affect access to shared spaces, constrain interactions, and predefine practices thereby establishing hierarchies within the household. We turn the discussion towards ethical challenges concerning control, whose problems the smart home is concerned with, and how the smart home embeds itself in the household.

To establish a respectful co-design relationship and enrich participation, we turn to Active Support (AS), an evidence-based strategy for engaging adults with severe intellectual disabilities. We present a reflective account of long-term field work that utilized the four aspects of AS, a) every moment has potential; b) graded assistance; c) little and often; d) maximizing choice and control.

Subjects first completed a series of trials to determine their user pace. They then completed a series of hierarchical drag-and-drop trials in which folders automatically expanded when the cursor hovered for longer than a controlled timeout. Results showed that preferences for timeout values correlated with user pace – slow-paced users preferred long timeouts, and fast-paced users preferred short timeouts.

The study highlights three challenges of stress-tracking data engagement that prevent effective technology usage: the lack of immediate awareness, the lack of pre-required knowledge, and the lack of corresponding communal support. Drawing on the stress-tracking practices uncovered in the study, we bring these issues to the fore, and unpack assumptions embedded in related works on self-tracking and how data engagement is approached. We end by calling for a reconsideration of data engagement as part of self-tracking practices with technologies rather than simply looking at the user interface.},

In a 2x2 between-subjects design, we investigated (1) the occurrence of a malfunction (AV failing to yield) and (2) system transparency (status eHMI vs. status+intent eHMI). Results show that during initial encounters, trust gradually increases and crossing onset time decreases. After a malfunction, trust declines but recovers quickly. In the status eHMI group, trust was reduced more, and participants showed 7.3 times higher odds of colliding with the AV as compared to the status+intent group.

Appliancizer automatically generates the PCB and low-level code from web-based prototypes and HTML mock-ups.

	abstract     = {The question of who gets to contribute to design futures and technology innovation has become a topic of conversation across HCI, CSCW, and other computing communities. This conversation has grave implications for communities that often find themselves an afterthought in technology design, and who coincidentally could benefit most from technological interventions in response to societal oppression. To explore this topic, we examined “futuring” through co-designed speculative design fictions as methods to envision utopian and dystopian futures. In a case study, we examined technology’s role in the imagined futures of youth participants of a Chicago summer design program. We highlight emerging themes and contribute an analysis of remote co-design through an Afrofuturism lens. Our analysis shows that concepts of utopian futures and technologies to support those futures are still heavily laden with dystopian realities of racism and poverty. We discuss ways that speculative design fictions and futuring can serve to address inclusivity in concept generation for new technologies, and we provide recommendations for conducting design techniques remotely with historically excluded populations.},

	abstract     = {We present a multi-modal approach for automatically generating hierarchical tutorials from instructional makeup videos. Our approach is inspired by prior research in cognitive psychology, which suggests that people mentally segment procedural tasks into event hierarchies, where coarse-grained events focus on objects while fine-grained events focus on actions. In the instructional makeup domain, we find that objects correspond to facial parts while fine-grained steps correspond to actions on those facial parts. Given an input instructional makeup video, we apply a set of heuristics that combine computer vision techniques with transcript text analysis to automatically identify the fine-level action steps and group these steps by facial part to form the coarse-level events. We provide a voice-enabled, mixed-media UI to visualize the resulting hierarchy and allow users to efficiently navigate the tutorial (e.g., skip ahead, return to previous steps) at their own pace. Users can navigate the hierarchy at both the facial-part and action-step levels using click-based interactions and voice commands. We demonstrate the effectiveness of segmentation algorithms and the resulting mixed-media UI on a variety of input makeup videos. A user study shows that users prefer following instructional makeup videos in our mixed-media format to the standard video UI and that they find our format much easier to navigate.},

We conduct mixed-method user studies on three datasets, where an AI with accuracy comparable to humans helps participants solve a task (explaining itself in some conditions). While we observed complementary improvements from AI augmentation, they were not increased by explanations. Rather, explanations increased the chance that humans will accept the AI’s recommendation, regardless of its correctness. Our result poses new challenges for human-centered AI: Can we develop explanatory approaches that encourage appropriate trust in AI, and therefore help generate (or improve) complementary performance?},

Here, we introduce an interactive method to explore and sample quality images from GANs. Our first two user studies showed that participants can use the tool to explore a GAN and select quality images. Our third user study showed that images sampled from a posterior probability distribution using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method on parameters of images collected in our first study resulted in on average higher quality and more diverse images than existing baselines.

Our review shows an ongoing need within VR research to more consistently include and report on women’s experiences in VR to better understand the gendered possibility of cybersickness.

In addition to creating 2D and 3D mechanical structures, LaserFactory creates conductive circuit traces with arbitrary geometries, picks-and-places electronic and electromechanical components, and solders them in place. To enable this functionality, we make four contributions. First, we build a hardware add-on to the laser cutter head that can deposit silver circuit traces and assemble components. Second, we develop a new method to cure dispensed silver using a CO2 laser. Third, we build a motion-based signaling method that allows our system to be readily integrated with commercial laser cutters. Finally, we provide a design and visualization tool for making functional devices with LaserFactory. Having described the LaserFactory system, we demonstrate how it is used to fabricate devices such as a fully functioning quadcopter and a sensor-equipped wristband. Our evaluation shows that LaserFactory can assemble a variety of differently sized components (up to 65g), that these can be connected by narrow traces (down to 0.75mm) that become highly conductive after laser soldering (3.2Ω/m), and that our acceleration-based sensing scheme works reliably (to 99.5% accuracy).},

We implemented a math-learning game in which we could individually layer various game mechanics, and over the course of 3 weeks, 99 participants played one of six versions: Baseline, Rewards, Novelty, Completion, Waiting, or Blocking. We compared the game versions by analyzing the players’ performance as well as behaviour. Using survival analysis, we identified that the addition of Completion and Blocking mechanics facilitated the strongest sustained engagement. These findings are congruent with existing theories of player experience and promote the development of guidelines on designing for sustained engagement in serious games.},

To explore the concept we considered two forms of PV-Pix: one uses rigid materials and the other flexible ones.

Aiming to help people use the password space more effectively, we propose a gameful password creation process. In this paper, we present GamePass, a gamified mechanism that integrates the GUA password creation process. We provide the first evidence that it is possible to nudge people towards better password choices by gamifying the process. GamePass randomly guides participants’ attention to areas other than the salient areas of authentication images, makes the password creation process more fun, and people are more engaged. Gamifying the password creation process enables users to interact better and make less predictable graphical password choices instead of being forced to use a strict password policy.},

Problematising the space of designing for breathing as a non-habitual act pertaining to different bodies or situations, we conducted a soma design exploration together with a classical singer. Reflecting on how sensors could capture the impact and somatic experience of being sensed led us to develop a new sensing mechanism using shape-change technologies integrated in the Breathing Shell: a wearable that evokes a reciprocal experience of “feeling the sensor feeling you” when breathing. We contribute with two design implications: 1) Enabling reflections of the somatic impact of being sensed in tandem with the type of data captured, 2) creating a tactile impact of the sensor data on the body. Both implications aim to deepen one’s understanding of how the whole soma relates to or with biosensors and ultimately leading to designing for symbiotic experiences between biosensors and bodies.},

Recent progress in deep learning has made face-swapping techniques a powerful tool for creative purposes, but also a means for unethical forgeries. Currently, it remains unclear why people are misled, and which indicators they use to recognize potential manipulations. Here, we conduct three perceptual experiments focusing on a wide range of aspects: the conspicuousness of artifacts, the viewing behavior using eye tracking, the recognition accuracy for different video lengths, and the assessment of emotions. Our experiments show that responses differ distinctly when watching manipulated as opposed to original faces, from which we derive perceptual cues to recognize face swaps. By investigating physiologically measurable signals, our findings yield valuable insights that may also be useful for advanced algorithmic detection.},

However, advances in sensing technology and interaction design suggest thinking about input on other surface, including soft materials. While touching rigid and soft materials might feel similar, they clearly feel different when pressure is applied to them. Yet, to date, studies only investigated force input on rigid surfaces. We present a first systematic evaluation of the effects of compliance on force input. Results of a visual targeting task for three levels of softness indicate that high force levels appear more demanding for soft surfaces, but that performance is otherwise similar. Performance remained very high (∼ 5% for 20 force levels) regardless of the compliance, suggesting force input was underestimated so far. We infer implications for the design of force input on soft surfaces and conclude that interaction models used on rigid surfaces might be used on soft surfaces.},

Three types of restraints observed in non-digital movement-based games, are explored here: fixating body parts,&nbsp;excluding body parts and&nbsp;depriving/manipulating bodily senses. Then, we investigate the experiential dynamics of restraints as a bodily play mechanic bridging a phenomenological perspective on bodily movement with theories on play. These investigations form the theoretical framework for the subsequent analysis of five digital body game examples. Building on this analysis and theoretical framework, we formulate five design strategies for implementing restraints as a mechanic for bodily play in HCI. We propose restraints as a generative resource for researchers and designers interested in understanding and designing bodily play experiences in HCI.},

The exponential drop-off in intensities with growing distance enables software to detect touch events, but does not reveal true contact areas. In this paper, we introduce CapContact, a novel method to precisely infer the contact area between the user’s finger and the surface from a single capacitive image. At 8 \texttimes{} super-resolution, our convolutional neural network generates refined touch masks from 16-bit capacitive images as input, which can even discriminate adjacent touches that are not distinguishable with existing methods. We trained and evaluated our method using supervised learning on data from 10 participants who performed touch gestures. Our capture apparatus integrates optical touch sensing to obtain ground-truth contact through high-resolution frustrated total internal reflection. We compare our method with a baseline using bicubic upsampling as well as the ground truth from FTIR images. We separately evaluate our method’s performance in discriminating adjacent touches. CapContact successfully separated closely adjacent touch contacts in 494 of 570 cases (87%) compared to the baseline’s 43 of 570 cases (8%). Importantly, we demonstrate that our method accurately performs even at half of the sensing resolution at twice the grid-line pitch across the same surface area, challenging the current industry-wide standard of a ∼ 4&nbsp;mm sensing pitch. We conclude this paper with implications for capacitive touch sensing in general and for touch-input accuracy in particular.},

Recent work has been predominantly descriptive, documenting and categorizing objectionable user interfaces. These contributions have been invaluable in highlighting specific designs for researchers and policymakers. But the current literature lacks a conceptual foundation: What makes a user interface a dark pattern? Why are certain designs problematic for users or society? We review recent work on dark patterns and demonstrate that the literature does not reflect a singular concern or consistent definition, but rather, a set of thematically related considerations. Drawing from scholarship in psychology, economics, ethics, philosophy, and law, we articulate a set of normative perspectives for analyzing dark patterns and their effects on individuals and society. We then show how future research on dark patterns can go beyond subjective criticism of user interface designs and apply empirical methods grounded in normative perspectives.},

We designed and tested an Augmented Reality (AR) HUD in an online study (N = 298), focusing on the influence of HUD visualizations on drivers’ situation awareness and perceptions. Participants viewed two driving scenes with one of three HUD conditions. Results were nuanced: situation awareness declined with increasing driving context complexity, and contrary to expectation, also declined with the presence of a HUD compared to no HUD. Significant differences were found by varying HUD complexity, which led us to explore different characterizations of complexity, including counts of scene items, item categories, and illuminated pixels. Our analysis finds that driving style interacts with driving context and HUD complexity, warranting further study.},

	abstract     = {Automated vehicles promise a future where drivers can engage in non-driving tasks without hands on the steering wheels for a prolonged period. Nevertheless, automated vehicles may still need to occasionally hand the control back to drivers due to technology limitations and legal requirements. While some systems determine the need for driver takeover using driver context and road condition to initiate a takeover request, studies show that the driver may not react to it. We present DeepTake, a novel deep neural network-based framework that predicts multiple aspects of takeover behavior to ensure that the driver is able to safely take over the control when engaged in non-driving tasks. Using features from vehicle data, driver biometrics, and subjective measurements, DeepTake predicts the driver’s intention, time, and quality of takeover. We evaluate DeepTake performance using multiple evaluation metrics. Results show that DeepTake reliably predicts the takeover intention, time, and quality, with an accuracy of 96%, 93%, and 83%, respectively. Results also indicate that DeepTake outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on predicting driver takeover time and quality. Our findings have implications for the algorithm development of driver monitoring and state detection.},

	abstract     = {Social interaction is the most complex challenge in daily life. Inevitably, social robots will encounter interactions that are outside their competence. This raises a basic design question: how can robots fail gracefully in social interaction? The characteristic human response to social failure is embarrassment. Usefully, embarrassment signals both recognition of a problem and typically enlists sympathy and assistance to resolve it. This could enhance robot acceptability and provides an opportunity for interactive learning. Using a speculative design approach we explore how, when and why robots might communicate embarrassment. A series of specially developed cultural probes, scenario development and low-fidelity prototyping exercises suggest that: embarrassment is relevant for managing a diverse range of social scenarios, impacts on both humanoid and non-humanoid robot design, and highlights the critical importance of understanding interactional context. We conclude that embarrassment is fundamental to competent social functioning and provides a potentially fertile area for interaction design.},

Our interviews revealed issues with over-positive, dissonant, cultural, and gender-assuming replies, as well as contextual politeness. In our experiments, crowdworkers assessed email scenarios that we generated and systematically controlled, showing that contextual factors like social ties and the presence of salutations impacts users’ perceptions of email correspondence.

The analysis suggests that agency perception depends on multiple factors beyond meaningful choice, such as social investment and genre-conventions. Participants described varying preferences and value judgements for different factors, indicating that individual differences have a deep impact on agency perception in narrative-focused gameplay.

In this work, we conduct a lab study (N = 16) to explore how accurately users can be identified during two task-driven scenarios based on their spatial movement. We show that an identification accuracy of up to 90% is possible across sessions recorded on different days. Moreover, we investigate the role of users’ physiology in behavioral biometrics by virtually altering and normalizing their body proportions. We find that body normalization in general increases the identification rate, in some cases by up to 38%; hence, it improves the performance of identification systems.},

It utilizes a change in the coupled impedance of an antenna and human fingers when the thumb and finger form a loop. We implemented a prototype controller in which AtaTouch detects the finger pinch of the grabbing hand. A user test with the prototype showed a finger-touch detection accuracy of 96.4%. Another user test with the scenarios of moving virtual blocks demonstrated low object-drop rate (2.75%) and false-pinch rate (4.40%).

While recent research demonstrates the expressive potential for biosignals, the value of sharing these personal data remains unclear. To understand their role in communication, we created Significant Otter, an Apple Watch/iPhone app that enables romantic partners to share and respond to each other’s biosignals in the form of animated otter avatars. In a one-month study with 20 couples, participants used Significant Otter with biosignals sensing OFF and ON. We found that while sensing OFF enabled couples to keep in touch, sensing ON enabled easier and more authentic communication that fostered social connection. However, the addition of biosignals introduced concerns about autonomy and agency over the messages they sent. We discuss design implications and future directions for communication systems that recommend messages based on biosignals.},

A composition task mimics actual user behavior and can allow researchers to better understand how a system might perform in reality. A problem with composition is that participants may gravitate towards writing simple text, that is, text containing only common words. Such simple text is insufficient to explore all factors governing a text entry method, such as its error correction features. We contribute to enhancing composition tasks in two ways. First, we show participants can modulate the difficulty of their compositions based on simple instructions. While it took more time to compose difficult messages, they were longer, had more difficult words, and resulted in more use of error correction features. Second, we compare two methods for obtaining a participant’s intended text, comparing both methods with a previously proposed crowdsourced judging procedure. We found participant-supplied references were more accurate.},

In the proposed system, an annotator first spatially lays out the incoming images and labels them on an open space, placing related items together. This serves as a working space (spatial organization) for tentative labeling. During the process, the annotator observes and organizes the similarities and differences between the items. Finally, the annotator provides definitive labels to the images based on the results of the spatial layout. We ran a user study comparing the proposed method and a traditional non-spatial layout in an image labeling task. The results demonstrated that annotators can complete the labeling tasks more accurately using the spatial layout interface than the non-spatial layout interface.},

The system controls the inclination angle and motion speed with the aim of achieving manipulative but unobtrusive posture guidance. To demonstrate its potential, we first built a prototype of TiltChair with a seat that could be tilted by pneumatic control. We then investigated the effects of the seat’s inclination angle and motions on task performance and overall sitting experience through two experiments. The results show that the inclination angle mainly affects the difficulty of maintaining one’s posture, while the motion speed affected the conspicuousness and subjective acceptability of the motion. However, these seating conditions did not affect objective task performance. Based on these results, we propose a design space for facilitating effective seat-inclination behavior using the three dimensions of angle, speed, and continuity. Furthermore, we discuss promising applications.},

We found that abuse of individuals with I/DD was often reported by someone other than the survivor, as survivors faced impediments in reporting. Consequently, we argue for developing a mobile-computing-based reporting tool for empowering individuals with I/DD to self-report abuse. Next, we conducted focus groups of individuals with I/DD to evaluate the tool’s viability, with respect to their ability to recognize/report abuse and use mobile-computing devices. We found individuals with I/DD could recognize/report abuse well when they received appropriate training. We also found individuals with I/DD could independently use their devices, though they shared access to them with family. Based on these findings, we call for several lines of accessibility research in designing an abuse self-reporting tool for individuals with I/DD.},

Through this analysis, three themes emerge: the tensions between epistemic agency and the context of work, encountering the ordinariness of racism through data work, and understanding the personal as communal and intersectional. Finally, critical race theory also prompts us to consider the very notions of data literacy that undergird our workshop activities.

In this space we generate new true-type-fonts through active learning, render texts with the new font, and measure individual users’ reading speed. Bayesian optimization sequentially generates new fonts on the fly to progressively increase individuals’ reading speed. The results of a user study show that this adaptive font generation system finds regions in the font space corresponding to high reading speeds, that these fonts significantly increase participants’ reading speed, and that the found fonts are significantly different across individual readers.},

In this paper, we propose a toy block approach for predicting a range of behavior problems in young children (4-6 years old) measured by the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). We defined and classified a set of quantitative play actions from IMU-embedded toy blocks. Play data collected from 78 preschoolers revealed that specific play actions and patterns indicate total problems, internalizing problems, and aggressive behavior in children. The results align with our qualitative observations, and suggest the potential of predicting the clinical behavior problems of children based on short free-play sessions with sensor-embedded toy blocks.},

To this end, we conducted semi-structured interviews with eight (8) adults with UEI about their use of authentication for their personal computing devices. We found that our participants primarily use passwords and PINs as a verification credential during authentication. We found the process of authentication to have several accessibility issues for our participants. Consequently, our participants implemented a variety of workarounds that prioritized usability over security throughout the authentication process. Based on these findings, we present six broad subareas of research that should be explored in order to create more accessible authentication for people with UEI.},

This can leave the reader struggling to understand what steps were taken to arrive at a figure, and what implications this has for the underlying results. In this paper, we introduce datamations, which are animations designed to explain the steps that led to a given plot or table. We present the motivation and concept behind datamations, discuss how to programmatically generate them, and provide the results of two large-scale randomized experiments investigating how datamations affect people’s abilities to understand potentially puzzling results compared to seeing only final plots and tables containing those results.},

Our challenge is to identify interface design considerations that support the safe and reliable execution of work. We looked specifically at maintenance procedures and conducted semi-structured interviews with process-plant maintainers. Thematic analysis identified eight factors influencing maintainers’ perceptions towards using digital technologies in their work. We map these factors to three categories, work identity, agency and community. These categories are consistent with concepts from the Job Characteristics Model (JCM). The contribution of this work is the relevance of job characteristics in guiding user interface design for maintainers, for which we make a number of recommendations.},

	abstract     = {We propose a novel modality for active biometric authentication: electrical muscle stimulation (EMS). To explore this, we engineered an interactive system, which we call ElectricAuth, that stimulates the user’s forearm muscles with a sequence of electrical impulses (i.e., EMS challenge) and measures the user’s involuntary finger movements (i.e., response to the challenge). ElectricAuth leverages EMS’s intersubject variability, where the same electrical stimulation results in different movements in different users because everybody’s physiology is unique (e.g., differences in bone and muscular structure, skin resistance and composition, etc.). As such, ElectricAuth allows users to login without memorizing passwords or PINs. ElectricAuth’s challenge-response structure makes it secure against data breaches and replay attacks, a major vulnerability facing today’s biometrics such as facial recognition and fingerprints. Furthermore, ElectricAuth never reuses the same challenge twice in authentications – in just one second of stimulation it encodes one of 68M possible challenges. In our user studies, we found that ElectricAuth resists: (1) impersonation attacks (false acceptance rate: 0.17% at 5% false rejection rate); (2) replay attacks (false acceptance rate: 0.00% at 5% false rejection rate); and, (3) synthesis attacks (false acceptance rates: 0.2-2.5%). Our longitudinal study also shows that ElectricAuth produces consistent results over time and across different humidity and muscle conditions.},

We reveal shortcomings of current wallet UX as well as users’ misconceptions, some of which can be traced back to a reliance on their understanding of conventional payment systems. For example, some users believed that transactions were free, reversible, and could be canceled anytime, which is not the case in reality.

Replays of participant sessions can aid in identifying usability problems during pilot studies and make individual analysis processes salient. To demonstrate the applicability of reVISit to visualization studies, we analyze participant data from two published crowdsourced studies.

Previous findings suggest that increasing the user’s attention can facilitate learning, so frequent interpretation errors may increase attention and learning; alternatively, however, interpretation errors may negatively interfere with skill development. To explore these potentially important effects, we conducted studies where participants learned commands with various rates of artificially injected interpretation errors. Our results showed that higher rates of interpretation error led to worse memory retention, higher completion times, higher occurrences of user error (beyond those injected by the system), and greater perceived effort. These findings indicate that when input mechanisms must interpret the user’s input, interpretation errors cause problems for user learning.},

This results in important other categories (digital eye strain (DES) and ergonomics) being largely neglected. To contribute to a more comprehensive picture of discomfort in VR head-mounted displays, we further conducted an online study (N=352) on the severity and relevance of all three symptom categories. Most importantly, our results reveal that symptoms of simulator sickness are significantly less severe and of lower prevalence than those of DES and ergonomics. In light of these findings, we critically discuss the current use of SSQ as the only discomfort measure and propose a more comprehensive factor model that also includes DES and ergonomics.},

Based on the findings of this study, we design HandPainter, a VR sketching system which focuses on the direct use of two hands for 3D sketching without requesting any tablet, pen, or VR controller. Our implementation is based on a pair of VR gloves, which provide hand tracking and gesture capture. We devise a set of intuitive gestures to control various functionalities required during 3D sketching, such as canvas panning and drawing positioning. We show the effectiveness of HandPainter by presenting a number of sketching results and discussing the outcomes of a user study-based comparison with mid-air drawing and tablet-based sketching tools.},

Casual and Cost-splitting are the two sharing practices identified. The owner is the sole payer for the account in the former, whereas profile holders split the cost in the latter. We distinguish two types of ownership in each practice—Primary and Dual. In Primary ownership, the account owner has the power to allow others to use the account; in Dual ownership, Primary ownership appears in conjunction with joint ownership, notably displaying asymmetric ownership perceptions among users. Conflicts arise when the sharing agreements collapse. Therefore, we propose design recommendations that bridge ownership differences based on sharing practices of DS accounts.},

It first identifies and explains the challenges inherent in ocular motor control and current eye tracking hardware, including overshooting, incorrect selections, and false activations. Through three empirical studies, we optimized and validated design parameters to mitigate these errors while reducing completion time, task load, and eye fatigue. Based on the findings from these studies, we derived a set of design guidelines to support gaze-based marking menus in AR/VR. To overcome the overshoot errors found with eye-based expert marking menu behaviour, we developed StickyPie, a marking menu technique that enables scale-independent marking input by estimating saccade landing positions. An evaluation of StickyPie revealed that StickyPie was easier to learn than the traditional technique (i.e., RegularPie) and was 10% more efficient after 3 sessions.},

In this work, we examine how individuals adjust their behavior when incentivized to avoid the algorithmic prediction of their intent. We present results from a virtual reality task in which gaze, movement, and other physiological signals are tracked. Participants are asked to decide which card to select without an algorithmic adversary anticipating their choice. We find that while participants use a variety of strategies, data collected remains highly predictive of choice (80% accuracy). Additionally, a significant portion of participants became more predictable despite efforts to obfuscate, possibly indicating mistaken priors about the dynamics of algorithmic prediction.},

Through a second focused survey and follow-up interviews, we provide insights into how respondents cope with crowdwork tasks. We found that standard task factors, such as task completion time and presentation, often do not account for the needs of users with disabilities, resulting in anxiety and a feeling of depression on occasion.

We found that, despite the fact that the current apps support a variety of language activities, most fail to carry out open-ended dialogue and provide extended back-and-forth opportunities, thus limiting their ability to encourage children’s language output and increase children’s language exposure. We discuss four design implications for developing VUIs that initiate dialogue and provide feedback in ways that better facilitate children’s language learning.},

Therefore, we first conducted an empirical pre-study with 24 consumers to understand value negotiations and current practices, co-designed the recommender system, and finally evaluated it in a real-world trial with ten consumers. Our findings show how recommender systems can support the negotiation of ethical values within the context of consumption practices, reduce the complexity of finding products and stores, and strengthen consumers. In addition to providing implications for the design to support critical consumption practices, we critically reflect on the scope of such recommender systems and its appropriation.},

We find 10.47% of search-results promote misinformative health products. We also observe ranking-bias, with Amazon ranking misinformative search-results higher than debunking search-results. Next, we analyze the effects of personalization due to account-history, where history is built progressively by performing various real-world user-actions, such as clicking a product. We find evidence of filter-bubble effect in Amazon’s recommendations; accounts performing actions on misinformative products are presented with more misinformation compared to accounts performing actions on neutral and debunking products. Interestingly, once user clicks on a misinformative product, homepage recommendations become more contaminated compared to when user shows an intention to buy that product.},

We propose Falx, a synthesis-powered visualization tool that allows users to specify visualizations in a similarly simple way but without needing to worry about data layout. In Falx, users specify visualizations using examples of how concrete values in the input are mapped to visual channels, and Falx automatically infers the visualization specification and transforms the data to match the design.

We integrate these perspectives and make them operational for interaction design by creating a framework including design considerations such as freedom of interaction, action-perception loops, multimodality, subtlety, ambiguity, skill development and temporal form. The framework is a result of a mixed-method approach including a review of existing definitions and scholarly artefacts, and a systematic literature review to identify design cases including an analysis of these design cases. We finally illustrate how the framework has been used to inform the design of a shape-changing soft-robotic interface.

One of the factors, a well-suited ambience, was difficult to achieve because of two common challenges: external conditions that prevent studying in study-friendly places and extra cost needed to create a personally desired ambience. We found that the viewers used “study with me” videos to create a personalized ambience at a lower cost, to find controllable peer pressure, and to get emotional support. These findings suggest that the viewers self-regulate their learning through watching “study with me” videos to improve efficiency even when studying alone at home.},

To explore the design of BezelGlide, we conducted two user studies. First, we quantified the amount of screen occlusion experienced when interacting with the smartwatch bezel. Next, we designed two techniques that involve gliding the finger along the smartwatch bezel for graph interaction. Full BezelGlide (FBG) and Partial BezelGlide (PBG), use the full or a portion of the bezel, respectively, to reduce screen occlusion while scanning a line chart for data. In the common value detection task, we find that PBG outperforms FBG and Shift, a touchscreen occlusion-free technique, both quantitatively and subjectively, also while mobile. We finally illustrate the generzability potential of PBG to interact with common graph types making it a valuable interaction technique for smartwatch users.},

We address this issue with SoloFinger, a novel concept that allows design of microgestures that are robust against movements that naturally occur during primary activities. Using a data-driven approach, we establish that single-finger movements are rare in everyday hand-object actions and infer a single-finger input technique resilient to false activation. We demonstrate this concept’s robustness using a white-box classifier on a pre-existing dataset comprising 36 everyday hand-object actions. Our findings validate that simple SoloFinger gestures can relieve the need for complex finger configurations or delimiting gestures and that SoloFinger is applicable to diverse hand-object actions. Finally, we demonstrate SoloFinger’s high performance on commodity hardware using random forest classifiers.},

We trained a robust, fast, memory-efficient, on-device model to detect UI elements using a dataset of 77,637 screens (from 4,068 iPhone apps) that we collected and annotated. To further improve UI detections and add semantic information, we introduced heuristics (e.g., UI grouping and ordering) and additional models (e.g., recognize UI content, state, interactivity).

This can further perpetuate the “digital divide,” a technology-based form of social inequality that has offline consequences. We introduce the term Marginalizing Design to describe designs that contribute to DDM. In this paper, we focus on the impact of Marginalizing Design on older adults through examples from our research and discussions of services that may have marginalizing designs for older adults. Our aim is to provide a conceptual lens for designers, service providers, and policy makers through which they can use to purposely lessen or avoid digitally marginalizing groups of users.},

We use a classic Bayesian reasoning task as a testbed for evaluating whether allowing users to interact with a static visualization can improve their reasoning. Through two crowdsourced studies, we show that adding interaction to a static Bayesian reasoning visualization does not improve participants’ accuracy on a Bayesian reasoning task. In some cases, it can significantly detract from it. Moreover, we demonstrate that underlying visualization design modulates performance and that people with high versus low spatial ability respond differently to different interaction techniques and underlying base visualizations. Our work suggests that interaction is not as unambiguously good as we often believe; a well designed static visualization can be as, if not more, effective than an interactive one.},

In this paper, we explain the design process of Snowflakes which is inspired by 7 design parameters (limbs, materials, grip, fastener, decoration, placement, form) extracted through the examination of non-smart jewelry.

However, it is yet unclear how those two concepts relate to each other. We focus on meaningfulness, a part of meaning-making that relates to feelings. In this paper, we present three projects where mundane objects, our data agents, are combined in meaningful ways with personal data with the aim to trigger reflection by placing a person’s individual experience of data in relation to others’. To identify relationships between self-reflection and meaningfulness we use Fleck and Fitzpatrick’s framework to describe the levels of reflection that we found in our projects and Mekler and Hornb\ae{}k’s meaning framework to define the depth of reflection. We conclude with a discussion on four themes in which we outline how data agents informed the intersections between our central concepts. This paper, constitutes a first step towards unpacking those relationships and invites for further explorations by the HCI community.},

This method is grounded in the cognitive principles of human visual object recognition. We present VisiFit – a computational design system that uses this method to enable novice graphic designers to improve blends with computationally generated options they can select, adjust, and chain together. Our evaluation shows novices can substantially improve 76% of blends in under 4 minutes.

We present the theoretical foundations and design tactics of Azalea, and characterize the experience through a qualitative empirical study.

While designing learning and assessment activities, many instructors face the choice of using open-ended or close-ended activities. Close-ended activities such as multiple-choice questions (MCQs) enable automated feedback to students. However, a survey with 22 HCI professors revealed a belief that MCQs are less valuable than open-ended questions, and thus, using them entails making a quality sacrifice in order to achieve scalability. A study with 178 students produced no evidence to support the teacher belief. This paper indicates more promise than concern in using MCQs for scalable instruction and assessment in at least some HCI domains.},

Findings show that participants could benefit from access to visual semantics for collaboration, navigation, and design. To learn this information, our participants used trial and error, sighted assistance, and features in existing screen reading technology like touch exploration. Finally, we found that missing information and inconsistent screen reader representations of user interfaces hinder learning.

However, conducting synchronous online co-design sessions adds layers of complexity and uncertainty to collaboration. This paper introduces a model explicating factors to consider when co-designing with children synchronously in an online space. We examined ten consecutive intergenerational participatory design sessions online where children (ages 7-11) and adults designed new technologies. Along with highlighting unexpected moments and interactions, we use theories of improvisation to guide our understanding of dynamic situations that are out of the control of researchers.

Recently, more experimental approaches such as design fiction explore these themes through fictional worldbuilding. This paper combines these approaches by adapting design fictions as a form of memoing, a qualitative analysis technique. The paper uses design fiction memos to analyze and reflect on ethnographic interviews and observational data about how user experience (UX) professionals at large technology companies engage with values and ethical issues in their work. The design fictions help explore and articulate themes about the values work practices and relationships of power that UX professionals grapple with. Through these fictions, the paper contributes a case study showing how design fiction can be used for qualitative analysis, and provides insights into the role of organizational and power dynamics in UX professionals’ values work.},

Mirrors here denote shared video feeds of people and screens. In a qualitative study of MirrorBlender with three hybrid meeting sessions, we found that the shared control of mirrors supported users in negotiating a blended interpersonal space. Moreover, it enabled diverse acts of inclusion of remote participants. In particular, remote participants brought attention to themselves by manipulating the position, scale, and translucency of their camera and screen feeds. Participants also embodied and leveraged their mirror images for deictic gestures and playful interactions. Based on these findings, we discuss new opportunities for supporting video-mediated collaboration.},

This paper contributes quantitative results from a survey of 395 crypto-asset users recruited by a novel combination of deep and broad sampling. The analysis accounts for heterogeneity with a new typology that partitions the sample in three robust clusters – cypherpunks, hodlers, and rookies – using five psychometric constructs. The constructs originate from established behavioral theories with items purposefully adapted to the domain. We demonstrate the utility of this typology in better understanding users’ characteristics and security behaviors.

In our analysis of an existing dataset of scenario-based smart home privacy decisions, we demonstrate that defaults and framing not only have a direct effect on participants’ decisions; they also moderate the effect of their cognitive appraisals of the presented scenarios on the decision. These results suggest that nudges like defaults and framing exacerbate the well-researched problem that people often employ heuristics rather than making deliberate privacy decisions, and that privacy-setting interfaces should avoid the effects of heuristic decision-making.},

Although prior research has found that many viewers seek real-life interpersonal interactions with real-person streamers, it is currently unknown what makes VTuber live streams engaging or how they are perceived differently than real-person streamers. We conducted an interview study to understand how viewers engage with VTubers and perceive the identities of the voice actors behind the avatars (i.e., Nakanohito). The data revealed that Virtual avatars bring unique performative opportunities which result in different viewer expectations and interpretations of VTuber behavior. Viewers intentionally upheld the disembodiment of VTuber avatars from their voice actors. We uncover the nuances in viewer perceptions and attitudes and further discuss the implications of VTuber practices to the understanding of live streaming in general.},

We base our analysis against 5 leading data protection frameworks that set out requirements and recommendations for data collection in children’s apps. To understand developers’ perspectives and constraints, we conducted 134 surveys and 20 semi-structured interviews with popular Android children’s app developers. Our analysis revealed that developers largely respect children’s best interests; however, they have to make compromises due to limited monetisation options, perceived harmlessness of certain third-party libraries, and lack of availability of design guidelines. We identified concrete approaches and directions for future research to help overcome these barriers.},

This might severely impact interpersonal communication, as the conversational partners will no longer share the same visual perception of reality. Grounded in color-in-context theory, we present a potential AR application scenario in which users can modify the color of the environment to achieve subconscious benefits. In a consecutive online survey (N=64), we measured the user’s comfort, acceptance of altering and being altered, and how it is impacted by being able to perceive or not perceive the alteration. We identified significant differences depending on (1) who or what is the target of the alteration, (2) which body part is altered, and (3) which relationship the conversational partners share. In light of our quantitative and qualitative findings, we discuss ethical and practical implications for future devices and applications that employ visual alterations.},

Existing AI-based approaches for partially automating coding, like supervised machine learning (ML) or explicit knowledge represented in code rules, require high technical literacy and lack transparency. Further, little is known about the interaction of researchers with AI-based coding assistance. We introduce Cody, an AI-based system that semi-automates coding through code rules and supervised ML. Cody supports researchers with interactively (re)defining code rules and uses ML to extend coding to unseen data. In two studies with qualitative researchers, we found that (1) code rules provide structure and transparency, (2) explanations are commonly desired but rarely used, (3) suggestions benefit coding quality rather than coding speed, increasing the intercoder reliability, calculated with Krippendorff’s Alpha, from 0.085 (MAXQDA) to 0.33 (Cody).},

This qualitative study examines how technologists with computer security expertise provided remote assistance to IPV survivors during the pandemic. Findings from 24 consults with survivors and five focus groups with technologist consultants show how remote delivery of technology support services raised three fundamental challenges: (1) ensuring safety for survivors and consultants; (2) assessing device security over a remote connection; and (3) navigating new burdens for consultants, including emotional labor.

However, current quadrotor camera tools do not consider the 3D extent of actual camera targets in their optimization schemes and simply interpolate between keyframes when generating a trajectory. This can yield videos with aesthetically unpleasing target framing. In this paper, we propose a target framing algorithm that optimizes the quadrotor camera pose such that targets are positioned at desirable screen locations according to videographic compositional rules and entirely visible throughout a shot. Camera targets are identified using a semi-automatic pipeline which leverages a deep-learning-based visual saliency model. A large-scale perceptual study (N ≈ 500) shows that our method enables users to produce shots with a target framing that is closer to what they intended to create and more or as aesthetically pleasing than with the previous state of the art.},

To facilitate this process, we co-designed user interfaces and underlying algorithms to highlight differences between trigger-action programs. Our novel approaches leverage formal methods to efficiently identify and visualize differences in program outcomes or abstract properties. We also implemented a traditional interface that shows only syntax differences in the rules themselves. In a between-subjects online experiment with 107 participants, the novel interfaces better enabled participants to select trigger-action programs matching intended goals in complex, yet realistic, situations that proved very difficult when using traditional interfaces showing syntax differences.},

We extend their use by extracting controllable and uncontrollable parameters from function structure models and visualizing their impact using envelope analysis. Function structure models allow designers to understand a system in terms of its functions and flows between functions and decouple functions from function carriers. Envelope analysis allows the designer to further study how parameters affect variables of interest, for example, accuracy, keystroke savings and other dependent variables. We provide examples of function structure models and illustrate a complete envelope analysis by investigating a parameterized function structure model of predictive text entry. We discuss the implications of this design approach for both text entry system design and for critique of system contributions.},

To address these, first, we develop LipType, an optimized version of LipNet for improved speed and accuracy.

Based on this, a survey is conducted, and a speculative technology probe is created in the form of an instrumented pillow for people to lock away their smartphones during the night. The pillow is deployed in a diary study in which five people sleep with their phone locked away for multiple nights. The self-reported and observed behaviours are presented in a selection of vignettes.

There was an aggregate trend toward increased wellbeing, with considerable variation within and across participants. Teens reported greater reliance on networked technologies as their unstructured time increased during lockdown. Using multilevel growth modeling, we found that how much total time teens spent with technology had less bearing on daily fluctuations in wellbeing than the satisfaction and meaning they derived from their technology use. Ultimately, teens felt online communication could not replace face-to-face interactions.

In this paper, we provide designers with a new vocabulary of unmaking operations within standard 3D modeling tools. We demonstrate how such designs can be realized using a novel multi-material 3D printing process. Finally, we detail how unmaking allows designs to change over time, is an ally to sustainability and re-usability, and captures themes of “aura,” emotionality, and personalization.},

To enable more realistic simulation than existing models, the model proposed in this study takes into account key features of the user and the external environment, such as intermittent motor control, click decision-making, visual perception, upper limb kinematics and the effect of input device. The simulated user’s point-and-click behaviour is formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP), and the user’s policy of action is optimised through deep reinforcement learning. As a result, our model successfully and accurately reproduced the trial completion time, distribution of click endpoints, and cursor trajectories of real users. Through an ablation study, we showed how the simulation results change when the model’s sub-modules are individually removed. The implemented model and dataset are publicly available.},

We are the first to articulate such a lens, and to provide a reflective tool to support future research and education. To create the map, we perform a thematic analysis of design process documents of a course on audience participation for Twitch, using this analysis to visually coordinate relationships between important themes. To help student designers analyze and reflect on existing experiences, we supplement the theme map with a set of mapping procedures. We validate the applicability of our map with a second set of student designers, who found the map useful as a comparative and reflective tool.},

Traditionally, the feedback comes in the form of a declarative statement, which often contains positive or negative sentiment. Prior research has shown that overly negative or positive sentiment can strongly influence the perceived usefulness and acceptance of feedback and, subsequently, lead to ineffective design revisions. To enhance the effectiveness of crowdsourced design feedback, we investigate a new approach for mitigating the effects of negative or positive feedback by combining open-ended and thought-provoking questions with declarative feedback statements. We conducted two user studies to assess the effects of question-based feedback on the sentiment and quality of design revisions in the context of graphic design. We found that crowdsourced question-based feedback contains more neutral sentiment than statement-based feedback. Moreover, we provide evidence that presenting feedback as questions followed by statements leads to better design revisions than question- or statement-based feedback alone.},

The second method interprets one continuous humming as an indication of the start and end of a word.

The input features include gesture recognition, nose deformation estimation, and continuous fingertip movement.

Our system achieves this by packing 1200 pins arranged on a 1.80 \texttimes{} 0.60m platform, in which each pin can be actuated to one of ten height levels (resolution: 15mm/level).

We found that in a system that occasionally provided unreasonable responses, showing a scatterplot increased the plausibility of unreasonable causal claims. Also, simply warning participants that correlation is not causation seemed to lead participants to accept reasonable causal claims more cautiously. We observed a strong tendency among participants to associate correlation with causation. Yet, the warning appeared to reduce the tendency.

While research has shown that guides can influence breathing rates under ideal conditions, there is little evidence that they can lead to underlying markers of physiological benefit under interrupted work conditions. Further, even if guides are effective during work tasks, it is unclear how personal and workplace factors affect peoples' willingness to adopt them for everyday use. In this paper, we present the results of a comparative, mixed-methods study of five different peripheral breathing guides. Our findings show that peripheral breathing guides are viable and can provide physiological markers of benefit during interrupted work. Further, we show that guides are effective – even when use is intermittent due to workplace distractions. Finally, we contribute guidelines to support the design of breathing guides for everyday information work.},

Despite the increased popularity of virtual mourning practices, and subsequently the emergence of HCI research in this area, there is little research looking into how continuing bonds maintained digitally promote or impede bereavement adjustment. Through a one-month diary study and in-depth interviews with 17 participants who recently lost their loved ones, we identified four broad mechanisms of how grievers engage in what we called ”backstage” grieving (as opposed to bereavement through digital public space like social media). We further discuss how this personal and private grieving is important in maintaining emotional well-being hence avoiding developing PGD, as well as possible design opportunities and challenges for future digital tools to support grieving.},

However, these studies have primarily focused on unimodal methods of feedback. In addition to this, studies do not assess whether skills are maintained after a given time. With a sample size of 22 this paper investigates whether multimodal social signal feedback is an effective method of improving communication in the context of media interviews. A pre-post experimental evaluation of media skills training intervention is presented which compares standard feedback with augmented feedback based on automated recognition of multimodal social signals. Results revealed significantly different training effects between the two conditions. However, the initial experiment study failed to show significant differences in human judgement of performance. A 6-month follow-up study revealed human judgement ratings were higher for the experiment group. This study suggests that augmented selective multimodal social signal feedback is an effective method for communication skills training.},

We focus on the forms of HCI knowledge and practice that proved useful to a coalition of community organizations claiming rights of input into and political oversight over surveillance technology. Their claims were a response to their exclusion from decision-making about smart city implementation in San Diego. We offer tactics “from below” as a way to attune HCI to the needs and practices of those excluded from power over widespread technology infrastructures. Ultimately, we argue that HCI cultivates a variety of capacities beyond design and redesign that can strengthen struggles to shape real-world technologies from below.},

The scale was developed based on past work on creepiness and a set of ten focus groups conducted with users from diverse backgrounds. We followed a structured process of analytically developing and validating the scale.

Undergraduates were usually more significantly efficient at solving a Parsons problem than writing the equivalent code, but not when the solution to the Parsons problem was unusual. This has implications for problem creators. This paper also reports on the mean cognitive load ratings of the two problem types and the relationship between efficiency and cognitive load ratings. Lastly, it reports on think-aloud observations of 11 students solving both adaptive Parsons problems and write-code problems and the results from an end-of-course student survey.},

When touching virtual objects, stiffness and roughness are common and obvious factors perceived by the users. Furthermore, when touching a surface with complicated surface structure, differences from not only stiffness and roughness but also surface height are crucial. To integrate these factors, we propose a pin-based handheld device, HairTouch, to provide stiffness differences, roughness differences, surface height differences and their combinations. HairTouch consists of two pins for the two finger segments close to the index fingertip, respectively. By controlling brush hairs’ length and bending direction to change the hairs’ elasticity and hair tip direction, each pin renders various stiffness and roughness, respectively. By further independently controlling the hairs’ configuration and pins’ height, versatile stiffness, roughness and surface height differences are achieved. We conducted a perception study to realize users’ distinguishability of stiffness and roughness on each of the segments. Based on the results, we performed a VR experience study to verify that the tactile feedback from HairTouch enhances VR realism.},

In Study 1, participants worked with either a chatbot or a human confederate.

Conversely, all participants worked with a chatbot in Study 3, but their partner was described as either a chatbot or a human. We investigated differences in idea generation outcomes and found that participants consistently contributed more ideas and ideas of higher quality when they perceived their teamworking partner to be a bot. Furthermore, when the conversational style of the partner was robotic, participants with high anxiety in group communication reported greater creative self-efficacy in task performance. Finally, whether the perceived dominance of a partner and the pressure to come up with ideas during the task mediated positive outcomes of idea generation depended on whether the conversational style of the bot partner was robot- or human-like.

In this paper, we investigate social perceptions of AI agents with various directions of communication in a cooperative game setting. We measure subjective social perceptions (rapport, intelligence, and likeability) of participants towards their partners when participants believe they are playing with an AI or with a human and the nature of the communication (responsiveness and leading roles). We ran a large scale study on Mechanical Turk (n=199) of this collaborative game and find significant differences in gameplay outcome and social perception across different AI agents, different directions of communication and when the agent is perceived to be an AI/Human. We find that the bias against the AI that has been demonstrated in prior studies varies with the direction of the communication and with the AI agent.},

	abstract     = {It is well documented that people living with mental health conditions are more likely to experience financial difficulties. When explaining this association, emphasis has often been placed on financial capability, i.e. the capacity of those living with poor mental health to manage their money. This paper challenges such capability-based explanations by reporting on a diary study and interviews with 14 people who self-identify as living with a mental health condition. We focused on their experiences of financial technology use, and explored the role technology played in their strategies to minimise the impact of mental health on their economic circumstances. Rather than lacking capability, participants’ practices revealed shortcomings of existing financial technologies and how they sought to work around these. We conclude by providing a set of design directions for technologies that engage those living with poor mental health not as vulnerable targets for financial inclusion, but as full financial citizens.},

Embedding digital biomarkers into games may further increase the reach of digital assessment. In this study, we explore game-based digital biomarkers for social anxiety, based on interaction with a non-player character (NPC). We show that social anxiety affects a player's accuracy and their movement path in a gaming task involving an NPC. Further, we compared first versus third-person camera perspectives and the use of customized versus predefined avatars to explore the influence of common game interface factors on the expression of social anxiety through in-game movements. Our findings provide new insights about how game-based digital biomarkers can be effectively used for social anxiety, affording the benefits of early and ongoing digital assessment.},

Through heating the embedded TF-Cells of the printed object, users can modify not only the deeper area of the object surface but also its form factor. With a series of technical experiments, we investigated TF-Cells’ thermoformability, depending on their structure’s parameters, orientations, and heating conditions. Next, we present a series of compound cells consisting of TF-Cells and solid structure to adjust stiffness or reduce undesirable shape deformation. Adapting the results from the experiments, we built a simple tool for embedding TF-Cells into a 3D model. Using the tool, we implemented examples under contexts of mechanical fitting, ergonomic fitting, and aesthetic tuning.},

An NFC reader can reliably recognize the presence of an NFC tag at a high read rate (∼ 300 reads/s) with low latency, but such high-speed reading has rarely been exploited because the reader may not effectively resolve collisions of multiple tags. Therefore, its human–computer interface applications have been typically limited to a discrete, hands-on interaction style using one tag at a time. In this work, we realized fluent, hands-off, and multi-tag tangible interactions by leveraging gravity and anti-collision physical constraints, which support effortless user input and maximize throughput. Furthermore, our system provides hot-swappable interactivity that enables smooth transitions throughout extended use. Based on the design parameters explored through a series of studies, we present a design space with proof-of-concept implementations in various applications.},

We therefore told our 43 participants that our IM app, IMStatus, was capable of automatically estimating and adjusting their receptivity status to responsive, attentive, or interruptible based on their smartphone activity. These statuses were also presented to their IM contacts in three different styles. Over a two-week period, the participants rarely chose the status interruptible, and when they did, it was usually to indicate low availability. Textual presentation was usually chosen to express statuses precisely, especially at high and low extremes of receptivity; while graphical and numeric presentations were preferred when self-perceived receptivity levels were more ambiguous.

Data collected from participants (N=16) shows how in-ear barometry can be used to detect voluntary tensor tympani contraction in the sealed ear canal. This data was used to train a classifier based on three simple ear rumble “gestures” which achieved 95% accuracy. Finally, we evaluate the use of ear rumbling for interaction, grounded in three manual, dual-task application scenarios (N=8).

We found that users experienced both FOMO and JOMO. FOMO was caused by the users’ awareness of parallel events in the spherical view, but users also experienced JOMO. FOMO did not compromise viewers’ sense of presence, and FOMO also decreased in the second viewing session, while JOMO remained constant.

To take advantage of these inaudible frequencies, we designed a Raspberry Pi-based device that captures inaudible acoustic frequencies with settings that can remove speech or all audible frequencies entirely. We conducted a perception study, where participants “eavesdropped’’ on PrivacyMic’s filtered audio and found that none of our participants could transcribe speech.

While we could not demonstrate that our design approach resulted in improved usability or user experience, we found that user-centered prototypes can increase the users’ comprehension of security implications. Hence, prototypes based on users’ intuitions, needs, and values are useful starting points for approaching long-standing security challenges. Applying complementary design approaches may improve usability and user experience further.},

However, many ACLS systems are ill-suited for rural contexts where students often need multiple kinds of support to complete tasks, may speak languages unsupported by the system, and require more than pre-assigned tutor-tutee student pairs for more equitable learning. We designed an intervention that fosters more equitable help-seeking by automatically detecting student struggles and prompts them to seek help from specific peers that can help. We conducted a mixed-methods experimental study with 98 K-3 students in a rural village in Tanzania over a one-month period, evaluating how the system affects student interactions, system engagement, and student learning. Our intervention increased student interactions by almost 4 times compared to the control condition, increased domain knowledge interactions, and propelled students to engage in more cognitively challenging activities.},

The majority surveyed believe that they can change how easily they are tilted and believing so was found to lead players to choose more positive responses to tilt.

Despite these tensions, the app succeeded in engaging tweens in outdoor nature explorations, and parents valued the shared family experiences around nature. Parents desired the app to support family bonding and inform them about how their tween used the app. This work shows how applications intended to support enriching youth experiences are experienced in the context of screen time tensions between parents and tween during a transitional period of child development.

The results of a memorability study with 300 participants showed that LociMotion had a significantly higher recall success rate than a control condition. A second study with 200 participants demonstrated the effectiveness of LociMotion over a period of time (99%, 96%, and 81% recall success rates after 1, 4, and 18 days, respectively).

However, transfer learning largely remains an expert tool due to its high complexity. In this paper, we design a prototype to understand non-expert user behavior in an interactive environment that supports transfer learning. Our findings reveal a series of data- and perception-driven decision-making strategies non-expert users employ, to (in)effectively transfer elements using their domain expertise.

In this paper, we create a back-of-device command and text input technique called BackSwipe, which allows a user to hold a smartphone with one hand, and use the index finger of the same hand to draw a word-gesture anywhere at the back of the smartphone to enter commands and text. To support BackSwipe, we propose a back-of-device word-gesture decoding algorithm which infers the keyboard location from back-of-device gestures, and adjusts the keyboard size to suit the gesture scales; the inferred keyboard is then fed back into the system for decoding. Our user study shows BackSwipe is feasible and a promising input method, especially for command input in the one-hand holding posture: users can enter commands at an average accuracy of 92% with a speed of 5.32 seconds/command. The text entry performance varies across users. The average speed is 9.58 WPM with some users at 18.83 WPM; the average word error rate is 11.04% with some users at 2.85%. Overall, BackSwipe complements the extant smartphone interaction by leveraging the back of the device as a gestural input surface.},

HCI has started to address the challenges of designing interactive performances, as both audience and performers’ experiences are considered and a variety of professional expertise involved. Nevertheless, research has overlooked how such design unfolds in practice, and what role artists play in exploring both the creative opportunities and the challenges associated with interweaving digital technologies. A two-day workshop was conducted to tailor the use of the ChameleonMask, a telepresence technology, within a performance. The analysis highlights the artists’ work to make the mask work while framing, exploring and conceptualizing its use. The discussion outlines the artists’ skills and design expertise, and how they redefine the role of HCI in performance-led research.},

Third-party vendors control communication tools for most U.S. prisons and jails and offer surveillance capabilities beyond what individual facilities could realistically implement. Frequent communication with family improves mental health and post-carceral outcomes for incarcerated people, but does discomfort about surveillance affect how their relatives communicate with them? To explore this and the understanding, attitudes, and reactions to surveillance, we conducted 16 semi-structured interviews with participants who have incarcerated relatives. Among other findings, we learn that participants communicate despite privacy concerns that they felt helpless to address. We also observe inaccuracies in participants’ beliefs about surveillance practices. We discuss implications of inaccurate understandings of surveillance, misaligned incentives between end-users and vendors, how our findings enhance ongoing conversations about carceral justice, and recommendations for more privacy-sensitive communication tools.},

We propose ReverseORC, a novel RE approach able to discover diverse layout types and their dynamic resizing behaviours independently of their implementation, and to specify them by using OR constraints. Unlike previous RE approaches, ReverseORC infers flexible layout constraint specifications by sampling UIs at different sizes and analyzing the differences between them. It can create specifications that replicate even some non-standard layout managers with complex dynamic layout behaviours. We demonstrate that ReverseORC works across different platforms with very different layout approaches, e.g., for GUIs as well as for the Web. Furthermore, it can be used to detect and fix problems in legacy UIs, extend UIs with enhanced layout behaviours, and support the creation of flexible UI layouts.},

Even with extensive facilitation, families faced difficulties in identifying needs for smart-home automation, except for social needs that emerged in all the families.

We evaluate GestureMap and its concepts with eight experts and an in-depth analysis of published data. Our findings show how GestureMap facilitates exploring large datasets and helps researchers to gain a visual understanding of elicited gesture spaces.

We first survey interface designers to better understand their example finding process. We then develop a large-scale UI dataset that provides an accurate specification of the interface’s view hierarchy (i.e., all the UI components and their specific location). By utilizing this dataset, we propose an object-detection based image retrieval framework that models the UI context and hierarchical structure. The framework achieves a mean Average Precision of 76.39% for the UI detection and high performance in querying similar UI designs.},

We conducted a set of experiments to gauge more precisely how embellishments affect how people relate to infographics and make sense of the conveyed story. By analyzing questionnaires, interviews, and eye-tracking data simplified by bundling, we show that, within bounds, embellishments have a positive effect on how users get engaged in understanding an infographic, with very limited downside. To our knowledge, our work is the first that fuses the aforementioned three information sources to understand infographics. Our findings can help to design more fine-grained studies to quantify the effects of embellishments and also to design infographics that effectively use the embellishments’ positive aspects identified. I think the contribution does not appear well in the abstract. It’s not just that the visual embellishments are positive.

A follow-up quantitative study explored whether these effects are mitigated by changing how predictions are conveyed.

	abstract     = {Data physicalisations afford people the ability to directly interact with data using their hands, potentially achieving a more comprehensive understanding of a dataset. Due to their complex nature, the representation of graphs and networks could benefit from physicalisation, bringing the dataset from the digital world into the physical one. However, no empirical work exists investigating the effects physicalisations have upon comprehension as they relate to graph representations. In this work, we present initial design considerations for graph physicalisations, as well as an empirical study investigating differences in comprehension between virtual and physical representations. We found that participants perceived themselves as being more accurate via touch and sight (visual-haptic) than the graphical-only modality, and perceived a triangle count task as less difficult in visual-haptic than in the graphical-only modality. Additionally, we found that participants significantly preferred interacting with visual-haptic over other conditions, despite no significant effect on task time or error.},

Firstly, we design a photographic interaction aid called mutually stimulatory memento, which is a cross-generational juxtaposition of semantically related photos to bring natural arousal of context-specific inter-generational empathy and reminiscence. Secondly, we build comprehensive ensemble AI models consisting of various deep neural networks and a runtime system that automates the creation of mutually stimulatory memento on top of the user’s usual photo-taking routines. We deploy MomentMeld in-the-wild with six families for an eight-week period, and discuss the key findings and further implications.},

However, such interactions are limited to space within reach. We present Poros, a system that allows users to rearrange space. After marking a portion of space, the distant marked space is mirrored in a nearby proxy. Thereby, users can arrange what is within their reachable space, making it easy to interact with multiple distant spaces as well as nearby objects. Proxies themselves become part of the scene and can be moved, rotated, scaled, or anchored to other objects. Furthermore, they can be used in a set of higher-level interactions such as alignment and action duplication. We show how Poros enables a variety of tasks and applications and also validate its effectiveness through an expert evaluation.},

We analyzed their verbalizations, extracted speech features, identified UX problems, and uncovered the patterns that indicate UX problems. Our results show that when older adults encounter problems, their verbalizations tend to include observations (remarks), negations, question words and words with negative sentiments; and their voices tend to include high loudness, high pitch and high speech rate. We compare these subtle patterns with those of young adults uncovered in recent studies and discuss the implications of these patterns for the design of Human-AI collaborative UX analysis tools to better pinpoint UX problems.},

We found that specialists are not solely interested in movement data, and that experiential information about stroke survivors’ lived experience plays an essential role in specialists interpreting movement data and creating a rehabilitation plan. We argue for a reconceptualization in stroke telerehabilitation that is more inclusive of non-movement data, and present design implications to better account for experiential information in telerehabilitation systems.},

By controlling the screen brightness, it intentionally connects or disconnects the path between the GND and the touchscreen, thus allowing the touch inputs to be controlled. In contrast to conventional physical extensions for touchscreens, our technique requires neither continuous finger contact on the conductive part nor the use of batteries.

However, different populations, particularly in marginalized communities, may have different levels of trust in human decision-makers. Do people who mistrust human decision-makers perceive human decisions to be more trustworthy and fairer than algorithmic decisions? Or do they trust algorithmic decisions as much as or more than human decisions? We examine the role of mistrust in human systems in people’s perceptions of algorithmic decisions. We focus on healthcare Artificial Intelligence (AI), group-based medical mistrust, and Black people in the United States. We conducted a between-subjects online experiment to examine people’s perceptions of skin cancer screening decisions made by an AI versus a human physician depending on their medical mistrust, and we conducted interviews to understand how to cultivate trust in healthcare AI. Our findings highlight that research around human experiences of AI should consider critical differences in social groups.},

Revamp is a browser integration that supports review-based question-answering interactions on a reconstructed product page. From our interview, we identified four main aspects (color, logo, shape, and size) that are vital for BLV users to understand the visual appearance of a product. Based on the findings, we formulated syntactic rules to extract review snippets, which were used to generate image descriptions and responses to users’ queries. Evaluations with eight BLV users showed that Revamp 1) provided useful descriptive information for understanding product appearance and 2) helped the participants locate key information efficiently.},

We compare three sonification strategies through a structured observation study with two professional aerial hoop performers.

Different sound designs affect their movement differently, and auditory feedback, regardless of type of sound, improves movement quality.

The majority envisioned dialogues with a VA that is interactive and not purely functional; it is smart, proactive, and has knowledge about the user. Attitudes diverged regarding the assistant’s role as well as it expressing humour and opinions. An exploratory analysis suggested a relationship with personality for these aspects, but correlations were low overall.

Recent advancements in mixed reality pave the way for virtual pets to provide a more natural and seamless experience for users. However, one key challenge is embedding environmental awareness into the virtual pet (e.g., identifying the food bowl’s location) so that they can behave naturally in the real world. We propose a novel approach to synthesize virtual pet behaviors by considering scene semantics, enabling a virtual pet to behave naturally in mixed reality. Given a scene captured from the real world, our approach synthesizes a sequence of pet behaviors (e.g., resting after eating). Then, we assign each behavior in the sequence to a location in the real scene. We conducted user studies to evaluate our approach, which showed the efficacy of our approach in synthesizing natural virtual pet behaviors.},

We propose a novel approach for adaptive user interfaces that yields a conservative adaptation policy: It finds beneficial changes when there are such and avoids changes when there are none.

Soma design is a first-person design method which considers users’ subjective somatic or bodily experiences of a design. Due to bodily changes over time, soma experiences are inherently temporal. Current instruments for articulating soma experiences lack the power to express the effects of experiences on the body over time. To address this, we turn to trajectories, a well-known concept in the HCI community, as a way of mapping this aspect of soma experience. By showing trajectories through a range of dimensions, we can articulate individual experiences and differences in those experiences. Through analysis of a set of soma experience designs and a set of temporal dimensions within the experiences, this paper demonstrates how trajectories can provide a practical conceptual framing for articulating the temporal complexity of soma designs.},

To this end, we conducted a replication study and built a virtual replica of CueAuth [52], a recently introduced authentication scheme, and report on results from: (1) a lab-based in-VR usability study (N=20) evaluating user performance; (2) an online security study (N=22) evaluating system’s observation resistance through virtual avatars; and (3) a comparison between our results and those previously reported in the real-world evaluation. Our analysis indicates that VR can serve as a suitable test-bed for human-centred evaluations of real-world authentication schemes, but the used VR technology can have an impact on the evaluation. Our work is a first step towards augmenting the design and evaluation spectrum of authentication systems and offers ground work for more research to follow.},

However, there is limited knowledge on the potential of these systems. In this paper, we present the development and evaluation of an interactive AI-based system that supports collaborative decision making with therapists for rehabilitation assessment. This system automatically identifies salient features of assessment to generate patient-specific analysis for therapists, and tunes with their feedback. In two evaluations with therapists, we found that our system supports therapists significantly higher agreement on assessment (0.71 average F1-score) than a traditional system without analysis (0.66 average F1-score, p &lt; 0.05). After tuning with therapist’s feedback, our system significantly improves its performance from 0.8377 to 0.9116 average F1-scores (p &lt; 0.01).

In collaboration with teachers, we developed socio-material tools that support them in empowering neurodiverse children to engage with technology in creative ways and create their own technologies. While the majority of technology design toolkits are stand-alone artefacts, part of our toolkit is an infrastructure to keep guiding and supporting teachers beyond the project’s end. In this paper, we discuss the teachers expectations and requirements for a toolkit and argue that an infrastructure must be part of a toolkit.

Assembler3 achieves this by semi-automatically converting 2D laser cutting plans to 3D, where users modify their models using available 3D tools (kyub), before converting them back to 2D. In our user study, this workflow allowed users to modify models 10x faster than using the traditional approach of editing 2D cutting plans directly. Assembler3 converts models to 3D in 5 steps: (1) plate detection, (2) joint detection, (3) material thickness detection, (4) joint matching based on hashed joint "signatures", and (5) interactive reconstruction. In our technical evaluation, Assembler3 was able to reconstruct 100 of 105 models. Once 3D-reconstructed, we expect users to store and share their models in 3D, which can simplify collaboration and thereby empower the laser cutting community to create models of higher complexity.},

Furthermore, the accuracies reported in previous studies have mostly been measured for a specific posture and could further decrease with free arm postures in real life. Herein, we present Heterogeneous Stroke, a design concept for improving the recognition accuracy of STPs on a WTD. By assigning unique vibrotactile stimuli to each tactor, the confusion between tactors can be reduced. Through our implementation of Heterogeneous Stroke, the alphanumeric characters could be delivered with high accuracy (93.8% for 26 alphabets and 92.4% for 10 digits) across different arm postures.},

However, they did not evaluate larger networks nor did they consider whether torus-based layout might also better display high-level network structure like clusters. We offer two algorithms for improving toroidal layout that is completely autonomous and automatic panning of the viewport to minimiswe wrapping links. The resulting layouts afford fewer crossings, less stress, and greater cluster separation. In a study of 32 participants comparing performance in cluster understanding tasks, we find that toroidal visualisation offers significant benefits over standard unwrapped visualisation in terms of improvement in error by 62.7% and time by 32.3%.},

In this work, first, we conduct two user studies to explore users’ attitudes towards the method with a particular focus on social acceptance and error tolerance. Results show that people perceive silent speech as more socially acceptable than speech input and are willing to tolerate more errors with it to uphold privacy and security. We then conduct a third study to identify a suitable method for providing real-time feedback on silent speech input.

These models remain challenging to optimize and often require a “human-in-the-loop” approach where domain experts use their knowledge to steer and adjust. However, the fragility, incompleteness, and opacity of these models means even minor changes could induce large and potentially undesirable changes in resulting model. In this paper we conduct a simulation-based analysis of human-centered interactions with topic models, with the objective of measuring the sensitivity of topic models to common classes of user actions. We find that user interactions have impacts that differ in magnitude but often negatively affect the quality of the resulting modelling in a way that can be difficult for the user to evaluate. We suggest the incorporation of sensitivity and “multiverse” analyses to topic model interfaces to surface and overcome these deficiencies. Code and Data Availability: https://osf.io/zgqaw},

This is especially manifested in our identification of three main mismatches between the two orders.

BackTrack simply extends the finger tracking area of the front screen, without interrupting the use of the front screen. It also provides a switch to prevent unintentional touch on the trackpad. All these features are enabled by a battery-free capacitive circuit, part of which is a transparent, thin-film conductor coated on a thin glass and attached to the front screen. To ensure accurate and robust tracking, the capacitive circuits are carefully designed. Our design is based on a circuit model of capacitive touchscreens, justified through both physics-based finite-element simulation and controlled laboratory experiments. We conduct user studies to evaluate the performance of using BackTrack. We also demonstrate its use in a number of smartphone applications.},

To begin our exploration in this domain, we investigated what the return experience is like first-hand. By returning to four long-term single player games played extensively in the past, we revealed a phenomenon we call The Pivot Point, a ‘eureka’ moment in return gameplay. The pivot point anchors our design explorations, where we created prototypes to leverage the pivot point in reconnecting with the experience. These return experiences and subsequent prototyping iterations inform our understanding of how to design better returns to gameplay, which can benefit both producers and consumers of long-term single player games.},

Ideally these approaches could be unified to integrate the user- and usage-dependent benefits found in each modality, yet these forms remain distinct. We propose parameterized declarative templates, a simple abstraction mechanism over JSON-based visualization grammars, as a foundation for multimodal visualization editors. We demonstrate how templates can facilitate organization and reuse by factoring the more than 160 charts that constitute Vega-Lite’s example gallery into approximately 40 templates. We exemplify the pliability of abstracting over charting grammars by implementing—as a template—the functionality of the shelf builder Polestar (a simulacra of Tableau) and a set of templates that emulate the Google Sheets chart chooser. We show how templates support multimodal visualization editing by implementing a prototype and evaluating it through an approachability study.},

Additionally, the simultaneously raised situation awareness could benefit potential take-overs. We report the results of two comparative online studies on visualizing semantic segmentation information for the human user of autonomous vehicles. Effects on trust, cognitive load, and situation awareness were measured using a simulation (N=32) and state-of-the-art panoptic segmentation on a pre-recorded real-world video (N=41).

By providing live feedback on how parts should be placed onto material sheets, analyzing how much material is consumed, and alerting users when designs are infeasible, Fabricaide enables users to proactively tailor their design to their available material. Fabricaide achieves this with a custom packing algorithm that arranges parts onto material sheets at interactive speeds.

We investigate (non)disclosure of pregnancy loss among LGBTQ people to known ties on identified social media as well as what constitutes ideal socio-technical disclosure environments. LGBTQ persons experiencing loss face intersectional stigma for holding a marginalized sexual and/or gender identity and experiencing pregnancy loss. We interviewed 17 LGBTQ people in the U.S. who used social media and had recently experienced pregnancy loss. We demonstrate how the Disclosure Decision-Making (DDM) framework explains LGBTQ pregnancy loss (non)disclosure decisions, thereby asserting the framework's ability to explain (non)disclosure decisions for those facing intersectional stigma. We illustrate how one's LGBTQ identity shapes (non)disclosure decisions of loss. We argue that social media platforms can better facilitate disclosures about silenced topics by enabling selective disclosure, enabling proxy content moderation, providing education about silenced experiences, and prioritizing such disclosures in news feeds.

Moreover, we observed a mismatch between measured and subjectively reported performance. We discuss the importance of the background and recommendations for visual real-world augmentations. Overall, our results suggest that AR can be used in many visually challenging environments without losing the ability to productively work with the visualizations shown.},

We found that bird watching surfaces a feeling of abjection, or a simultaneous repulsion and fascination with a part of oneself one rejects in pursuit of personal growth. Along the way, we honed a practice of attunement through deep listening and field recording, which enabled immersive "ecological" experiences. We offer (1) an account of our method and process, (2) the framework of abjection as an approach to designing amongst the complexity of human/non-human interaction, and (3) reflections on how to design for ecological thinking in the push towards a posthuman design.},

We conducted a qualitative study of flagging practices in League of Legends (LoL), a popular eSports game. We found stark differences between how flag is designed to identify toxicity, and flaggability, or how players use and appropriate flag. Players distrust flag, but also appropriate flag for instrumental purposes. Thus, flaggability diverges decidedly from the conception of toxicity, and must be understood within the highly competitive gaming context of LoL.

Using real-life adapted vignettes, our experiments show that AI agents are held causally responsible and blamed similarly to human agents for an identical task. However, there was a meaningful difference in how people perceived these agents’ moral responsibility; human agents were ascribed to a higher degree of present-looking and forward-looking notions of responsibility than AI agents. We also found that people expect both AI and human decision-makers and advisors to justify their decisions regardless of their nature. We discuss policy and HCI implications of these findings, such as the need for explainable AI in high-stakes scenarios.},

Yet, current conversational interactions normatively may promote non-desirable ends, delivering a restricted range of request-response interactions with sexist and digital colonialist tendencies. Our critical design approach envisions alternatives by considering how future voices can reside in CUIs as enabling probes. We present novel explorations that illustrate the potential of CUIs as critical design material, by critiquing present norms and conversing with imaginary species. As micro-level interventions, we show that conversations with diverse futures through CUIs can persuade us to critically shape our discourse on macro-scale concerns of the present, e.g., sustainability. We reflect on how conversational interactions with pluralistic, imagined futures can contribute to how being human stands to change.},

	abstract     = {Videogames’ increasing cultural relevance and suffusion into everyday use contexts suggests they can no longer be considered novelties. Broadly speaking, games research at CHI has concerned two forms of peak experience—historically, research aimed to support flow, or maximise enjoyment and positive emotions; more recently, scholarship engages with more varied experiences of intense emotion, such as emotional challenge. In different ways, both approaches emphasise extra-ordinary player experience (PX). Conversely, videogame play and PX have become more routine—indeed, more ordinary—as the medium’s cultural presence grows. In this paper, we argue that HCI games research is conceptually ill-equipped to investigate these increasingly common and often desirable experiences. We conceptualise “ordinary player experience” – as familiar, emotionally moderate, co-attentive, and abstractly memorable – articulating a phenomenon whose apparent mundanity has seen it elude description to date. We discuss opportunities to productively employ ordinary PX in HCI games research, alongside conceptual implications for PX and player wellbeing.},

Younger adults were more likely to change their perception of data sensitivity based on trust, while older adults were more likely to disclose information based on perceived benefits of disclosure. These results suggest older adults made more rationally calculated decisions than younger adults, who made heuristic decisions based on app trust.

This lack of guidelines makes it hard to compare techniques across studies, to report evaluations consistently, and therefore to accumulate or replicate findings. To build such guidelines, we review 20 years of studies on VR object selection and manipulation. Based on the review, we propose recommendations for designing studies and a checklist for reporting them.

To explore ST conceptually, we conducted interviews with 29 AI users and practitioners grounded in a speculative design scenario. We suggested constitutive design elements of ST and developed a conceptual framework to unpack ST’s effect and implications at the technical, decision-making, and organizational level. The framework showcases how ST can potentially calibrate trust in AI, improve decision-making, facilitate organizational collective actions, and cultivate holistic explainability.

Through a thematic analysis on willingness to report, we also demonstrate that players abstain from reporting toxic content because they view it as acceptable, typical of games, as banter, or as not their concern.

However, this speedup has only been explored while the device is attached to the user. In fact, very little is known regarding whether this faster reaction time still occurs after the user removes the device from their bodies–this is precisely what we investigated by means of a simple reaction time (RT) experiment, in which participants were asked to tap as soon as they saw an LED flashing. Participants experienced this in three EMS conditions: (1) fast-EMS, the electrical impulses were synced with the LED; (2) agency-EMS, the electrical impulse was delivered 40ms faster than the participant’s own RT, which prior work has shown to preserve one’s sense of agency over this movement; and, (3) late-EMS: the impulse was delivered after the participant’s own RT. Our results revealed that the participants’ RT was significantly reduced by approximately 8ms (up to 20ms) only after training with the agency-EMS condition. This finding suggests that the prioritizing agency during EMS training is key to motor-adaptation, i.e., it enables a faster motor response even after the user has removed the EMS device from their body.},

	abstract     = {Meditation is a mind-body practice with considerable wellbeing benefits that can take different forms. Novices usually start with focused attention meditation that supports regulation of attention towards an inward focus or internal bodily sensations and away from external stimuli or distractors. Most meditation technologies employ metaphorical mappings of meditative states to visual or soundscape representations to support awareness of mind wandering and attention regulation, although the rationale for such mappings is seldom articulated. Moreover, such external modalities also take the focus attention away from the body. We advance the concept of interoceptive interaction and employed the embodied metaphor theory to explore the design of mappings to the interoceptive sense of thermoception. We illustrate this concept with WarmMind, an on-body interface integrating heat actuators for mapping meditation states. We report on an exploratory study with 10 participants comparing our novel thermal metaphors for mapping meditation states with comparable ones, albeit in aural modality, as provided by Muse meditation app. Findings indicate a tension between the highly discoverable soundscape's metaphors which however hinder attention regulation, and the ambiguous thermal metaphors experienced as coming from the body and supported attention regulation. We discuss the qualities of embodied metaphors underpinning this tension and propose an initial framework to inform the design of metaphorical mappings for meditation technologies.},

Scholars have identified a variety of factors that affect disclosure behavior, but as platforms offer a wider range of affordances that enable more diverse user behaviors and nuanced audience segmentation, these influencing factors are increasingly intertwined. However, little is known about the interrelatedness of platform, affordance, and audience. Drawing on survey data of 470 American adults during the COVID-19 pandemic, this study examines the interplay and relative strength of the factors influencing distress disclosure on social media. We introduce the concept of social media disclosure ecology as an analytical lens to understand online disclosure. The results suggest that perceived affordances (i.e., anonymity, persistence, visibility control) and relational closeness to audience separately and interactively predict the depth of distress disclosure, which in turn affects satisfaction with disclosure. This study contributes to the literature on online-disclosure and privacy, while providing implications for the design of social media to better support people in distress.},

However, when how-to videos involve physical activities, people inconveniently alternate between controlling the video and performing the tasks. Adopting a voice user interface allows people to control the video with voice while performing the tasks with hands. However, naively translating timeline manipulation into voice user interfaces (VUI) results in temporal referencing (e.g. “rewind 20 seconds”), which requires a different mental model for navigation and thereby limiting users’ ability to peek into the content. We present RubySlippers, a system that supports efficient content-based voice navigation through keyword-based queries. Our computational pipeline automatically detects referenceable elements in the video, and finds the video segmentation that minimizes the number of needed navigational commands. Our evaluation (N=12) shows that participants could perform three representative navigation tasks with fewer commands and less frustration using RubySlippers than the conventional voice-enabled video interface.},

In this paper, we attempt to enhance diagnostic transparency by augmenting OSCs with explanations. We first conducted an interview study (N=25) to specify user needs for explanations from users of existing OSCs. Then, we designed a COVID-19 OSC that was enhanced with three types of explanations. Our lab-controlled user study (N=20) found that explanations can significantly improve user experience in multiple aspects. We discuss how explanations are interwoven into conversation flow and present implications for future OSC designs.},

What is novel in our device is that it quickly tucks away when the user interacts with real-world objects. Its design allows it to fold back on top of the user's nail when not in use, keeping the user's fingerpad free to, for instance, manipulate handheld tools and other objects while in MR. To achieve this, we engineered a wireless and self-contained haptic device, which measures 24\texttimes{}24\texttimes{}41&nbsp;mm and weighs 9.5&nbsp;g. Furthermore, our foldable end-effector also features a linear resonant actuator, allowing it to render not only touch contacts (i.e., pressure) but also textures (i.e., vibrations). We demonstrate how our device renders contacts with MR surfaces, buttons, low- and high-frequency textures. In our first user study, we found that participants perceived our device to be more realistic than a previous haptic device that also leaves the fingerpad free (i.e., fingernail vibration). In our second user study, we investigated the participants’ experience while using our device in a real-world task that involved physical objects. We found that our device allowed participants to use the same finger to manipulate handheld tools, small objects, and even feel textures and liquids, without much hindrance to their dexterity, while feeling haptic feedback when touching MR interfaces.},

Through a mixed-methods approach incorporating critical play sessions, a survey of 237 boardgame players, and interviews with 18 boardgame designers and publishers, we identified the key functions performed by the digital tools in these games. Using affinity mapping, we grouped these functions into eight core categories, which were tested and refined using a survey of 44 boardgame players and designers. This model defines and classifies the diverse functions that digital tools perform in hybrid digital boardgames, demonstrating their range and potential application for researchers and game designers.},

This unprecedented context is likely to have a lasting impact on the practice of schooling and the role of online, digital platforms within school contexts. In this paper we present a contextual inquiry of an ‘emergency home school context’, detailing how nine young families in Melbourne, Australia adapted to the unexpected introduction of school to the home following the government-directed closure of schools. Through an online interview and photo-journal study, we develop an emplaced understanding of the context detailing how the relations between people and places around the home evolved over time. We present five design considerations for digital platforms to support the emergency home school context, placing focus on the fluid roles, relationships and evolving sense of place.},

Informed by needfinding interviews, we developed a voice-guided smartphone application leveraging storytelling as a creative activity by which to teach CT concepts to 5- to 8-year-old children. The app includes two storytelling games where users create and listen to stories as well as four CT games where users then modify those stories to learn about sequences, loops, events, and variables. We improved upon the app design through wizard-of-oz testing (N = 28) and iterative design testing (N = 22) before conducting an evaluation study (N = 22). Children were successfully able to navigate the app, effectively learn about the target computing concepts, and, after using the app, children demonstrated above-chance performance on a near transfer CT concept recognition task.},

Thus, in this work we conduct methodological research to evaluate metrics identified from prior work (including reading speed, comprehension questions, and subjective judgements of understandability and readability) in terms of their effectiveness for evaluating texts modified to be at various complexity levels with DHH adults at different literacy levels. Subjective metrics and low-linguistic-complexity comprehension questions distinguished certain text complexity levels with participants with lower literacy. Among participants with higher literacy, only subjective judgements of text readability distinguished certain text complexity levels. For all metrics, participants with higher literacy scored higher or provided more positive subjective judgements overall.},

Specifically, we have developed Nurse AMIE (Addressing Metastatic Individuals Everyday) by leveraging the Amazon Alexa to remotely deliver validated interventions. We believe that voice interactions can significantly lower the barrier to interact with remote intervention technologies for this population. In a pilot study, we deployed Nurse AMIE for 14 days over 6 women with MBC. Based on the collected data, this paper discusses the feasibility, acceptability, and future directions of Nurse AMIE. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to use smart speakers to support women with MBC.},

In two studies, we combined in-depth interviews (n=15) with diary and co-design methods (n=23) to investigate how a mix of Americans exposed to misinformation during COVID-19 understand their information environments, including encounters with interventions such as Facebook fact-checking labels. Analysis reveals a deep division in user attitudes about platform labeling interventions, perceived by 7/15 interview participants as biased and punitive. As a result, we argue for the need to better research the unintended consequences of labeling interventions on factual beliefs and attitudes. Alongside these findings, we discuss our methods as a model for continued independent qualitative research on cross-platform user experiences of misinformation in order to inform interventions.},

Also, sample code and settings often have privacy-unfriendly defaults laced with dark patterns to nudge developers’ decisions towards privacy-unfriendly options such as sharing sensitive data to increase revenue.

Moving from this theoretical framework, we identified a development process - from the UX design to coding of activities – which is based on a novel set of Design Patterns at multiple layers of abstraction. We then put this framework into practice by implementing these patterns into two technological solutions – tablet and robots – and performing an empirical study to evaluate their benefits. Our results, although still preliminary since they assessed only a tablet experimental condition, are promising for extending the identified Design Patterns to other technological solutions.},

In this paper, we propose a system that presents a presence-like sensation using an electrostatic field. Through experiments, we showed that the system can present a presence-like sensation and investigated the distance that is most suitable for inducing a presence-like sensation.},

We suggest that the function of few-shot examples in these cases is better described as locating an already learned task rather than meta-learning. This analysis motivates rethinking the role of prompts in controlling and evaluating powerful language models. We discuss methods of prompt programming, emphasizing the usefulness of considering prompts through the lens of natural language. We explore techniques for exploiting the capacity of narratives and cultural anchors to encode nuanced intentions and techniques for encouraging deconstruction of a problem into components before producing a verdict. Informed by this more encompassing theory of prompt programming, we also introduce the idea of a metaprompt that seeds the model to generate its own natural language prompts for a range of tasks. Finally, we discuss how these more general methods of interacting with language models can be incorporated into existing and future benchmarks and practical applications.},

In this paper, we present a study providing initial evidence that playing a single brief session of &nbsp;Academical, a choice-based interactive narrative game, can significantly improve players’ attitudes about RCR. We further demonstrate the relationship between engagement with the game and resulting attitudes. Combined with our previous work showing &nbsp;Academical’s advantages over traditional RCR training for teaching cognitive learning outcomes, this study’s results highlight that utilizing a choice-based interactive story game is a uniquely effective way to holistically address RCR learning outcomes that drive ethical research behavior.},

A small corpus of 8 papers published between 2012 and 2020 were found. Findings suggest a mix of positive and negative effects related to removing gamification. Significantly, insufficient reporting, methodological weaknesses, limited measures, and superficial interpretations of “negative” results prevent firm conclusions. I offer a research agenda towards better understanding the nature of gamification removal. I end with a call for empirical and theoretical work on illuminating the effects that may linger after systems are un-gamified.},

In this research, we introduce the “empathetic routing” framework for providing human-centered routing based on historical biomarkers of the drivers collected through naturalistic settings and by using smart wearable devices. Through this framework, we rank three specific routes between two points in the city of Charlottesville, based on historical driver heart rate data collected through a three-month naturalistic driving study. Additionally, we demonstrate that the proposed framework is capable of finding infrastructural elements in a route that can potentially affect a driver’s well-being.},

Mobile apps for tracing people’s contacts seem effective, but raise public concerns, e.&nbsp;g., about privacy. Hence, they are contested in public discourse. We report a large-scale NLP-supported analysis of people’s comments about the German contact-tracing app on news websites, social media and app stores. We identified prevalent topics, stances, and how commenting developed over time. We found privacy to be among the most debated topics discussed from various perspectives. Commenting peaked at one point in time, when public discourse centered on the potential tracing protocols and their privacy protection. We encourage further research on the link between the public discussions and actual adoption rates of the app.},

Using these recordings, our model can predict the participants’ well-being scores with a mean absolute error of 14%, relative to the self-reported well-being (“ground truth”). Both audio and text features from the recordings, especially, MFCC and semantic features, are important for prediction accuracy.

The inescapable reality is that drones will become a ubiquitous part of society. One major obstacle to the mainstream acceptance of drones is the public perception of drones being dangerous or a safety hazard. This paper presents an investigation into the human factors toward potential drone collisions. The study included twenty participants who underwent a controlled drone collision exposure and a post-exposure interview. We propose a novel drone collision exposure involving a novel experimental setup simulating drone to human collisions safely. We found that all participants identified the drone’s propellers as their primary concern, with the propeller’s sound being the most threatening. Based on the participant feedback, we identified some concerns on a drone’s unregulated aspects and outline common participant recommendations on drone regulations.},

In this study, we aimed to investigate the player’s bereavement process while playing the commercial death-themed game Spiritfarer. Through a thematic analysis of qualitative in-depth interviews with 6 participants, we found that the player’s grieving experience closely resembled the Dual Process Model of Coping with Bereavement by Stroebe and Schut. In the game, players oscillated between facing loss-orientation stressors (‘Character resemblance to the deceased’, ‘Sending characters away’) and restoration-orientation stressors (‘Taking care of remaining spirits’). Through this process, the participants coped with and sometimes reappraised their loss. We further found that the players bereavement experience and level of engagement greatly varied depending on their ‘prior loss experience’, ‘gaming environment’ and ‘tendency to focus on self or game’. Those differences were partly accommodated by the game through its complex and diverse characters and engaging game elements. We conclude with insights for future works in game design for bereavement support.},

Our study also revealed that the (mis)alignment of people's assumptions of others’ knowledge is key to failed humor and its consequences. NNS felt that NS often assumed everyone shared the knowledge required to understand their humor; thus, cultural references unfamiliar to NNS were a dominant source of confusion. On the other hand, NNS often felt ignorant for not knowing the references required to understand NS humor, as they assumed all the references unfamiliar to them must be generic knowledge known by all NS.

In contrast, Stack Exchange has contracted despite being more responsive and being as capable of addressing mainstream UX concepts as Reddit.

Proactive speakers, on the other hand, have the potential to empower a broad range of applications such as context-aware health interventions and self-tracking systems. To achieve proactivity, however, requires the speaker to become context-aware and be able to detect opportune moments to initiate interactions. In this work, we present a proactive speaker prototype based on Google Home to investigate interaction contexts. We, additionally, built a voice-based Experience Sampling Method (ESM) application to study contextual factors that are correlated to opportune moments for device-triggered interactions. Preliminary results from a three-week field study with 7 participants indicate the proposed prototype is a robust way to achieve proactivity and implement voice-based ESM. We present use cases for future research and applications for proactive smart speakers in the context of digital health.},

We found that EWs authored a higher ratio of mental health related tweets during the pandemic than the average user, but authored fewer tweets with Covid related keywords than average users. Despite this, sentiment analysis showed that, on average, EWs’ tweets yield a more positive sentiment score than average Twitter users, both before and during the pandemic.

In this study, we propose the PneuMat, an interactive shape-changing system integrating sensors and pneumatic drives, to help ensure sleep safety through novel human-computer interaction. This system comprises sensor units, control units and inflatable units. The sensor units utilize information exchange between infants and the system, and detect the infant's sleeping posture, sending raw data to control units. For better sleep experience, the inflatable units are divided into nine areas. The inflatable units are multi-mode, can be independently inflated in different areas, and can be inflated in different areas together. We aim to ensure sleep safety by ensuring that infants stay in a safe sleeping position while in bed, by autonomously actuating the PneuMat's shape-changing capability. In this article, we describe the division of PneuMat, the design of the control unit, integration of the sensors and our preliminary experiments to evaluate the feasibility of our interaction system. Finally, based on the results, we will discuss future work involving the PneuMat.},

This expectation mismatch can cause potential and existing users to distrust self-driving technology and can increase the likelihood of accidents. We propose a simple but effective framework, AutoPreview, to enable consumers to preview a target autopilot’s potential actions in the real-world driving context before deployment. For a given target autopilot, we design a delegate policy that replicates the target autopilot behavior with explainable action representations, which can then be queried online for comparison and to build an accurate mental model. To demonstrate its practicality, we present a prototype of AutoPreview integrated with the CARLA simulator along with two potential use cases of the framework. We conduct a pilot study to investigate whether or not AutoPreview provides deeper understanding about autopilot behavior when experiencing a new autopilot policy for the first time. Our results suggest that the AutoPreview method helps users understand autopilot behavior in terms of driving style comprehension, deployment preference, and exact action timing prediction.},

Furthermore, it makes spectators aware of how visual information is processed by humans (i.e., only a small fraction with high visual acuity is perceived at a given moment).

Our design software lets users play with parameters and preview the resulting forms until achieving their desired shapes. We also developed slit injection printing that directly injects colored jelly into a base jelly, and shared several design examples to show the breadth of design possibilities. We hope to enable more people to design and create their own flower jellies while expanding access and the design space for digitally fabricated foods.},

However, it has remained unknown how different VR technology would influence pedestrian behaviour. This paper presents VR experiments that were conducted with 70 participants using a desktop VR or a HMD VR to perform four different wayfinding tasks in a multi-story building. Quantitative analysis of pedestrian behaviour data and user experience data were performed in order to investigate the impact of the technological differences between the two VR techniques. It was found that participants had better wayfinding task performance in the desktop group. However, the route and exit choice and user experience were overall similar between the two groups. The findings suggest that one could adopt more ‘simple’ VR technologies for studies featuring ‘simple’ wayfinding tasks.},

The goal of this special interest group is to provide a forum for researchers and practitioners to discuss and advance the theoretical underpinnings of designed friction, the relation of friction to other design paradigms, and to identify the domains and interaction flows that frictions might best suit.

SIGHint aims to provide a platform to facilitate high level discussion and collation of information between researchers and designers seeking to learn from and contribute to the development of Human-Computer Integration.

However, during COVID19, the ‘truth’ has not always been clear. It has not always been easy to prepare public health messaging that is consistent, easily understood or practical for everyone to apply. This presents unique challenges, to which social media platforms need to be part of the solution. One such solution can be found on www.reddit.com where, in January 2020, a group of research scientists, students, academics and medics came together to create and moderate forums in which the pandemic can be discussed and questions about it answered. These forums provide case studies of how information can be generated, misinformation corrected and disinformation debunked on subreddits with, combined, more than 3 million subscribers.},

Leveraging the potential of artificial intelligence and combining them with human-computer interaction approaches allows developing intelligent user interfaces supporting users better than ever before.

Using examples and application scenarios, we practically show how intelligent user interfaces can be designed and implemented. In particular, we look at how to create optimized keyboards, use natural language processing for text and speech-based interaction, and how to implement a recommender system for movies. Thus, this course aims to introduce participants to a set of machine learning tools that will enable them to build their own intelligent user interfaces.

	abstract     = {Data in everyday life is represented in ways that are supposed to connect with our needs, tasks and situations, to inform and facilitate effectiveness and functionalism. And still, all we see are numbers, charts or graphics. We engage in sense-making all day through analytical interpretation, which is often not intuitive and causes friction whenever we encounter it in an everyday context. In our work, we aim for a different experience in everyday data-sensemaking that translates sensor data, time and data from external sources into lively, yet mundane video vignettes. The aim is to connect the experience to the phenomenon behind data, to deny data the stage and spotlight in our Everyday. This case study shows the design and implementation of a novel, interactive video installation that projects mundane data into an Everyday context, giving the data a new form and meaning. We work with video vignettes that are designed as short, neutral video fragments and show a person in different mundane situations, acting alone or interacting with props. The design process went through three iterations before the installation was exhibited as part of a group exhibition. We reflect on the most important design decisions, turning points in the process and how design and implementation are intertwined throughout the installation preparation. We conclude with a short overview of the contribution and an outlook to future work.},

Increasingly, researchers have stated the need to get away from technological solutions that intend to ‘normalize’ disabled individuals, towards providing alternative ways that accommodate diverse bodies and minds. To achieve this, scholars and activists call for a shift in the design paradigm in which both the designers’ orientation and the design processes centre not only the needs of people with disabilities but also their lived experience and tacit knowledge. Moreover, more mainstream technologies must be built to accommodate them to the best extent possible, instead of leaving the responsibility to specialised assistive technologies. My PhD has been focused on uncovering and highlighting the competencies that people with visual impairments employ in their technology practices and how these are showcased, by closely examining a corpus of ethnographic data, including a comprehensive set of video demonstrations. Furthermore, my research aims to explore how these findings can be used for practical design within and beyond the accessibility and assistive technology fields, resulting in the production of resources that aid the design for supporting and extending such competencies.},

The aim is to better understand how we can re-think the senses in technology design for disability interactions and the dynamic self, constructed through continuously changing sensing capabilities either because of changing ability or because of the empowering technology.

Yet, there has been little attention paid to the diversity and ingenuity of algorithmic understandings crafted by the workers. In this workshop, our goal is to bring together researchers and practitioners from across disciplines to create a research agenda, compare vocabularies, and discuss methodologies around this form of&nbsp;“folk tradecraft.” This toolkit will help elicit insights into these phenomena and ultimately build mechanisms by which the labor of algorithmic meaning-making can be respected, understood, and leveraged for system design.},

Watson Research Center in 1978, I found a dedicated 3277 “green screen” terminal on my desk attached to a 370 mainframe. Hot-rodded with an onboard character buffer and double speed cursor circuitry, I could fly through writing and coding, personally experiencing the productivity benefits of sub-second response time [1].Beyond some great hardware (for the time), I also had extraordinary colleagues. I imprinted on the working style of John Gould and Stephen Boies as we built the second hardware iteration of what became the world's first commercial voice mail system and its final manifestation as the messaging system for the 1984 Summer Olympics. In this talk I'll share some of the still relevant behavioral principles of system design we learned in the course of that project [2].Beyond this, I'll review work in early (pre-Web!) Internet access for schools [3], home shopping [4], Web accessibility [5], and programmer productivity in peta-scale scientific computing [6]. Each project will highlight a barrier to building useful and usable systems, barriers that still persist.

Using these methods, I quantify the prevalence of dark patterns in three studies and show how dark patterns are rampant on the web, thus a pressing concern for society. First, I examine whether social media content creators, or “influencers,” disclose their relationships with advertisers to their audience. Analyzing over 500K YouTube videos and 2.1M Pinterest pins, I find that only about 10% of all advertising content is disclosed to users. Second, I examine various types of dark patterns in shopping websites. Analyzing data from 11K shopping websites, I discover over 1,800 dark patterns on over 1,200 websites that mislead users into making more purchases or disclosing more information than they would otherwise. Third, I examine dark patterns in political emails from the 2020 U.S. election cycle. Through an analysis of over 100K emails, I find that over 40% of emails from the median sender contain dark patterns that nudge recipients to open emails or make donations they might otherwise not make. I further outlay the conceptual foundation of dark patterns and articulate a set of normative perspectives for analyzing the effects of dark patterns. I conclude with how the lessons learned from the studies can be used to build technical defenses and to lay out policy recommendations to mitigate the spread of these interfaces.},

Then, based on the three-dimensional (3D) interaction characteristics of VR devices, we propose two vrCAPTCHA design prototypes (i.e., task-driven and bodily motion-based CAPTCHAs). We conducted a user study with six participants for exploring the feasibility of our two vrCAPTCHAs and traditional CAPTCHAs in VR. We believe that our two vrCAPTCHAs can be an inspiration for the further design of CAPTCHAs in VR.},

The Express Skin is equipped with a projector on its back, four pyramid-shaped projection modules on its front, and a LED lights system strengthening the visualization of gaming content by reacting simultaneously with the projections and with the tactile interaction (Figure 1: Full sketch of high-fidelity prototype). Through the creation of Expressive Skin, we want to ignite the fuse of fashion and gaming, as a viable way to achieve Extensive Immersion.},

The experimental results indicated that the weight perceptions of the brightness–weight and material–weight illusions in VR were opposite to those in the real world. However, the weight perception of the size–weight illusion in VR was the same as in the real world.

To explore socio-cultural aspects in food practices and to understand the potential role of self-tracking tools in participants’ everyday lives, we designed and deployed a probe kit with seven participants. We found that (1) participants had differing, and at times conflicting, conceptions of what made their diet sustainable; (2) they viewed self-tracking tools as an unobtrusive means to help them achieve a goal–but didn’t report that those goals were ever met; and (3) they expressed strong associations between particular eating behaviors and rituals and/or holidays. Reflecting on the results and the concept of design (in)action, we suggest an alternative way of designing self-tracking tools for self-reflection (i.e., the art of noticing) that might help people draw attention to the impact of their food practices on the environment. We conclude by recommending a shift in focus from traditional and “always-on” self-tracking solutions to everyday practices, holidays, or rituals in which a technological tool could bring more attention to a particular facet of food sustainability.},

We investigated whether automated keyword tagging would assist people's comprehension of imperfect MT outputs and, therefore, enhance the quality of communication between subgroups. We conducted an online experiment where twenty teams performed a collaborative task. Each team consisted of two native English speakers and two native Mandarin speakers. We provided MT support that enabled participants to read all subgroups’ discussions in English before team meetings, but in two forms: with vs. without automated keyword tagging. We found MT with automated keyword tagging affected people's interaction with the translated materials, but it did not enhance translation comprehensibility in the context of teamwork.},

In the experiment, proprioceptive stimulation was based on the kinesthetic illusion induced by vibratory stimulation of muscle spindles and skin stretch near the joint. Participants were given a context in which they grasped an object and actively moved. They were asked to evaluate the perception of the object and the arm as the phase between movement and stimulation, and the conditions of stimuli were changed. Consequently, it was found that the perception of not only the arm but also the hand-held object could be changed, although there were large individual differences.},

We conducted a content analysis of the recommendations given for circumventing surveillance provided by media, news, activist, and commercial outlets. We describe the recommendations provided and identify common fears and implications of protest surveillance as expressed by these sources. We identified thematic categories of surveillance fears and implications, including ruined reputations, online harassment, arrest, lack of transparency, and the chilling of free speech and protest. Finally, we describe what we see as challenges protesters will have implementing the recommendations (for example, due to availability and accessibility of technology and certain types of expertise required), complicating the creation of the kind of security culture protesters need.},

	abstract     = {Soft robotics use in haptic devices continues to grow, with pneumatic control being a common actuation source. Typical control systems used, however, rely on a digital on/off control allowing only inflation/deflation at a set rate. This limits the degrees of freedom available when designing haptic experiences. We present an alternative system to allow the use of analog control of the pneumatic waveform profiles to design and experiment with haptic devices, and to determine the optimum wave profile for the desired experience. Using a combination of off-the-shelf components and a user interface, our system allows for rapid experimentation with various pressure levels, and the ability to control waveform profiles in a common format such as attack-sustain-release. In this paper, we demonstrate that by altering the attack and release profiles we can create a more pleasant pulsing sensation on the wrist, and a more continuous sensation for communicating movement around the wrist.},

However, not much is known about whether current ephemeral interactions on social media are successful in doing so, or whether there are ephemerality-related design opportunities for social media platforms that can improve identity expression. In an 8-day qualitative diary study, participants reported when they posted on social media, and responded to questions about the type of content they shared, their motivation, and the content’s ideal duration. We discuss our findings about short-term and long-term ephemerality as part of the social media experience, and the potential impact on the evolving identities of teenagers and young adults.},

In doing so, we contest both hierarchical approaches to users in cybersecurity—which seek to ‘solve’ the problems of human behavior—and a tendency in HCI to equate action research with the development of novel technology solutions. Our findings draw highlight barriers to engaging with cybersecurity, the role of personal experiences (for instance of gender, race or sexuality) in shaping this engagement, and the benefits of communal approaches to cybersecurity.},

Based on a multi-stakeholder co-design process including GPs, domain experts, people with mild ID and carers, our previous work developed prototype technology to support people with mild ID in GP consultations. This paper discusses the findings of a usability study performed on the resulting prototype. Five experts in ID/usability, four caregivers, and five GPs participated in cognitive and post-task walkthroughs. They found that the application has the potential to increase communication, reduce time constraints, and overcome diagnostic overshadowing. Nevertheless, the participants also identified accessibility barriers relating to: medical imagery; the abstract nature of certain conditions; the use of adaptive questionnaires; and the overloading of information. Potential solutions to overcome these barriers were also discussed.},

This lack of safety precaution occurs in spite of the numerous safety sensors and warning indicators embedded within modern vehicles. This presents a clear need for more effective methods of encouraging consistent seatbelt use. To that end, this work leverages wearable technology and activity recognition techniques to detect when individuals have buckled their seatbelt. To develop such a system, we collected smartwatch data from 26 different users. From this data, we identified trends which inspired the development of novel features. Using these features, we trained models to identify the motion of fastening a seatbelt in real-time. This model serves as the basis for future work in which systems can provide personalized and effective interventions to ensure seatbelt use.},

We call this an Experiential Persona because it allows designers to interact with and explore the artifacts, individually and as a collection, to imagine and experience the world of ‘the user’. This more embodied, interactive and open-ended persona can potentially support richer sense making; encouraging a more open, emergent, and unfinalized view of people we design for.

In this work, we designed and implemented an emotionally aware CA, called HUE (Heard yoUr Emotion) that stylized responses with emotion regulation strategies and empathetic interjections. We conducted a user study with 75 participants to evaluate their perceived emotional intelligence (PEI) of HUE by having them observe conversations between people and HUE in different emotional scenarios.

However, there are users who are hesitant to adopt IoT devices due to various privacy and security concerns. In this paper, we elicit peoples’ attitude and concerns towards adopting IoT devices. We conduct an online survey and collect responses from 232 participants from three different geographic regions (United States, Europe, and India); the participants consist of both adopters and non-adopters of IoT devices. Through data analysis, we determine that there are both similarities and differences in perceptions and concerns between adopters and non-adopters. For example, even though IoT and non-IoT users share similar security and privacy concerns, IoT users are more comfortable using IoT devices in private settings compared to non-IoT users. Furthermore, when comparing users’ attitude and concerns across different geographic regions, we found similarities between participants from the US and Europe, yet participants from India showcased contrasting behavior. For instance, we found that participants from India were more trusting in their government to properly protect consumer data and were more comfortable using IoT devices in a variety of public settings, compared to participants from the US and Europe. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations to reduce users’ concerns in adopting IoT devices, and thereby enhance user trust towards adopting IoT devices.},

Until now, there has been very little research on how the physical surroundings might affect virtual content placement for collaborative sensemaking. We therefore conducted an initial study with eight participants in which we compared two different room settings for collaborative image categorization regarding content placement, spatiality, and layout. We found that participants tend to utilize the room’s vertical surfaces as well as the room’s furniture, particularly through edges and gaps, for placement and organization. We also identified three different spatial layout patterns (panoramic-strip, semi-cylindrical layout, furniture-based distribution) and observed the usage of temporary storage spaces specifically for collaboration.},

In this work, we leverage a parallel rendering technique to enable ultrabright graphics that can pass through transmissive materials. While previous work has shown interactive hidden displays, our approach unlocks expressive interfaces with practical end-to-end software and low-cost hardware implementation on mass-produced passive OLED displays.

In offline isolated word testing on a 1164-word dictionary, SilentSpeller achieves an average 97% character accuracy. 97% offline accuracy is also achieved on phrases recorded while walking or seated. Live text entry achieves up to 53 words per minute and 90% accuracy, which is competitive with expert text entry on mini-QWERTY keyboards without encumbering the hands.},

A camera in the virtual environment operates as a video feed to the teleconferencing software. An interface resembling a tablet mirrors the teleconferencing window inside the virtual environment, thus enabling the participant in the VR environment to see the webcam participants in real-time. This allows the presenter to view and interact with other participants seamlessly.

Building management systems in commercial spaces commonly operate on predefined temperature setpoints and control strategies. Many systems target aggregated cohort comfort and neglect to consider the individual occupant’s thermal preferences, leading to high dissatisfaction rates. While recent studies focus on personalized comfort models, such systems mainly operate on occupant preference prediction and do not investigate the reasons for discomfort. This paper presents TREATI’s human-in-the-loop decision-making process. TREATI is a framework that targets thermal comfort conflict resolution in shared spaces using rationale management techniques while considering both individual and cohort comfort. TREATI uses several levels of abstraction separating device management, event processing, context, and rationale management. This separation allows users to adapt the framework to existing building management systems to provide fair decision-making.},

To address this gap, we present an additional conceptual tool for design: the ecosystema. This design construct is analogous to a persona, but at the level of an entire ecosystem rather than of a particular human population or animal species. These constructs could allow ecosystem-wide impacts to influence design processes more effectively, and may provide greater leverage on current environmental crises than existing human-centered techniques.},

Traditionally when in need, people can get help from human assistants to complete these thinking tasks, yet, such human experts are not always accessible. Intelligent agents, such as physical robots and virtual chatbots, are promising alternatives to the human assistants in these tasks. My doctoral research focuses on designing intelligent agents to assist human users and evaluating the impact of their interaction mechanisms (i.e., way of behaving) on user experience. Specifically, my works surround this theme by proposing: 1) an anticipation-autonomy framework that models the service robot’s proactivity in decision-making support contexts (decision-making); 2) a bot assistant that helps users to solve the problem of writing poor-quality comments in online mental health communities either by assessing the writing performance or recommending writing examples (problem-solving); and 3) a chatbot in comparison to a non-conversational tool for facilitating people to read academic papers critically (critical thinking). My dissertation contributes to the design of intelligent agents for helping people in high-level thinking tasks and insights for developing appropriate interaction mechanisms for these agents in the future.},

For comparison, Major League Baseball has 500 million views and $10 billion in revenue, FIFA Soccer 900 million and $1.6 billion. Despite this significant popularity, much of the world remains unaware of esports — and in particular, research on and for esports is still extremely scarce compared to esports’ impact and potential. The Esports and High Performance HCI (EHPHCI) workshop will begin addressing that research gap. In esports, athletes compete through the computer interface. Because this interface can make the difference between winning and losing, esports athletes are among the most expert computer interface users in the world, as other athletes are experts in using balls and shoes in traditional sports. The premise of this workshop is that people will apply esports technology broadly, improving performance in a wide range of human activity. The workshop will gather experts in engineering, human factors, psychology, design and the social and health sciences to discuss this deeply multidisciplinary enterprise.},

In this work, we focused on situations in which CAs do not provide a proper answer because of a lack of information. Under these situations, we aimed to find more effective answer strategies for CAs to provide people better user experiences. We tested four different response strategies using different degrees of inferences and information as ground. We found differences in usability and user experience depending on how CAs respond. Our results will help designers understand how people feel about the way CAs respond and create better CA responses in situations where it is difficult to provide accurate answers.&nbsp;},

	abstract     = {Record linking is needed to analyze observations across multiple sessions. However, recent privacy legislature such as the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) restricts the storage of information that identify individuals. Obtaining permissions to store information about individuals can be bureaucratic and time-consuming. Anonymous schemes such as self-generated ids and machine generated ids have been proposed. However, self-generated linking ids demand effort from the participants, while machine assisted schemes typically generate long and incomprehensible ids. Consequently, there is a risk that students and researchers will limit their research to single-session experiments to avoid privacy issues. To simplify the administration of small multi-session experiments, the HIDE procedure is proposed for generating short human readable ids for linking participants across multiple sessions while maintaining anonymity and being robust to input errors. The approach is different from previous approaches in that the goal is to minimize the length of the linking ids. First, the procedure converts the participant's name into a phonetic representation. Next, this phonetic representation is hashed, and a truncated snippet of the hash is used as the linking id. HIDE is initialized by searching for a salt (a random data added to the hash input) that minimizes the id lengths. Experiments show that the procedure is capable of coding small experiments with 20 participants using two digits, and experiments of around 200 participants with four digits. An implementation of the procedure has been made available through a simple web interface. It is hoped that the procedure can help students and HCI researchers collect more comprehensive data by following participants over time, while protecting their privacy.},

While typing passwords is straightforward with a keyboard, it has been cumbersome with conventional AR/VR input techniques such as in-air gestures and hand-held controllers. In this work, we developed a fluent authentication technique that allows AR/VR users to unlock their profiles with simple head gestures (e.g., nodding). This resembles the powerful “Slide to Unlock” interaction on touch screen devices. Specifically, we extract bio-features such as neck length and head radius from IMU sensor readings of these head gestures for user identification with machine learning. Though our approach is less strict compared with conventional password-based methods, we believe its swiftness greatly facilitates scenarios with frequent user switching (e.g., device sharing across team and family members) which demand quick authentications. Through a 10-participant evaluation, we demonstrated that our system is robust and accurate with an average accuracy of 97.1% on groups of 5, simulating family and lab use.},

While this is not feasible for most language learners, language learning games may be able to replicate an immersive language learning experience. We developed Delivery Ghost, a web-based game to teach Mandarin Chinese to beginner-level learners, including complete beginners. In a 2x2 experiment (N=159), we tested how immersion and interactivity affect learning gains (pre-post test) and experiences (enjoyment, flow, perceived learning, cognitive load). Participants in all conditions showed significant learning gains even though no explicit, lecture-style teaching was provided. We also found evidence of substantial learning gains and positive learning experiences independent of the level of immersion (i.e., availability of hints in English) and interactivity (i.e., animation vs. gameplay). These results suggest that interactivity and immersion are less critical to learning at the beginner-level than a well-structured curriculum.},

In this paper, we present SkinLace, a freestanding lace by machine embroidery for on-skin interface. Conductive thread, water-soluble stabilizer, and home embroidery machine can create SkinLace, which is aesthetic, light, skin-compatible, body-conforming, durable, and inexpensive. The freestanding lace approach enables aesthetic customizable lace and patches through a combination of non-conductive and colorful threads. We propose three different applications of SkinLace; on-skin displays, capacitive touch sensing, and RFID tag antenna. Tension of the thread in the embroidery machine and the accuracy of the stitch are the main challenges, but the advantages and potential to create more complex circuitry and to enhance sensing capability present rich opportunities for further exploration.},

Today, code puzzles are predominantly introduced through static puzzle sequences with increasing difficulty. However, adaptive systems in other domains have improved learning efficiency. This paper takes a step towards developing adaptive code puzzle systems based on controlling learners’ cognitive load. We conducted a study comparing static code puzzle pathways and adaptive pathways that predict cognitive load on future puzzles. While the trialled adaptive recommendation policy did not result in better learning, our findings point us towards a different policy which may have a greater effect on learner experience. In addition, we identify predictors of student dropout, and use our experimental data to quantify learners’ puzzle-solving experiences into 7 principal component properties and use these factors to suggest approaches for future adaptive systems.},

In this study, we interviewed 23 commenters in the COVID-19 super-topic to examine their motivations and strategies for commenting. Our findings showed that geographical proximity and expertise level affected users’ commenting behaviors. For example, non-locals or people lacking professional knowledge applied a “copy-and-paste” strategy and acted as a bridge between help-seekers and influencers on social media, while locals and experts focused on detailed information and provided targeted help. Some commenters also exhibited avoidance behaviors due to their sense of powerlessness and frustration in such a long-lasting pandemic. We discuss the implications of our findings for designing social media platforms to better support people in need during crisis situations.},

In this paper, we collect data from 26 authentic customers of a fast food restaurant while interacting with a total of 120 products on a self-order terminal. From our observations during the experiment and a qualitative analysis of the collected gaze data, we derive best practice approaches regarding the integration of eye tracking software into self-service systems. We evaluate several implicit calibration strategies that derive the user’s true focus of attention either from the context of the user interface, or from their interaction with the system. Our results show that the original gaze estimates can be visibly improved by taking into account both contextual and interaction-based information.},

A trained image classifier estimates semantic material information from textured meshes mapping predicted labels to a database of measured frequency-dependent absorption coefficients; trained on a material image patches generated from superpixels, it produces inference from meshes, decomposing their unwrapped textures. The most frequent label from predicted texture patches determines the acoustic material assigned to the input mesh. We test the pipeline on a real environment, capturing a conference room and reconstructing its geometry from point cloud data.

As an alternative, we suggest an approach based on Social Practice Theory. We conceptualize social context as interactions between co-located social practices and acceptability as a matter of their (in)compatibilities.

Namely, we designed two CFC-targeted security nudges, Promotion and Prevention, for the individuals who care about future and immediate consequences, respectively. An online survey (N = 145) was conducted to test their effectiveness. Results show that both the nudges can improve users’ security attitudes, while the moderation effects imply that the Promotion nudge is merely effective for the users having deep concerns about future consequences. The findings indicate the feasibility of designing security nudges targeted at future orientations and illustrate the importance of tailoring nudges according to individuals’ differences.},

We propose a novel gaze gesture sensor based on laser feedback interferometry (LFI), which is capable to measure the rotational velocity of the eye as well as the sensor’s distance towards the eye. This sensor delivers a unique and novel set of features with an outstanding sample rate allowing to not only predict a gaze gesture but also to anticipate it. To take full advantage of the unique sensor features and the high sampling rate, we propose a novel gaze symbol classification algorithm based on single sample. At a mean F1-score of 93.44 %, our algorithms shows exceptional classification performance.},

To this end, we use computational and manual techniques to extract 130 knowledge claims based on 9139 sentences from 346 persona articles and analyze whether the existing literature supports these claims. The results, clustered into four groups (“Definition”, “Creation”, “Evaluation”, and “Use”), indicate that claims regarding persona definition are characterized by a higher degree of consensus. In contrast, persona creation and use contain a high proportion of unverified claims. There are few claims concerning evaluation. Empirical research should address unverified claims and develop the ontological understanding on persona evaluation.},

Our target use case is for students who study using electronic textbooks and who are frequently mobile. We present a series of pilot studies that examine the benefits of different types of summaries and their locations, with respect to variations in text content and participant cohorts. We find that users prefer reviews after an interruption, but that previews shown after interruptions have a larger positive influence on comprehension.

	abstract     = {The configuration of office environments is related to worker satisfaction and can improve work efficiency. Although open offices promote communication among co-workers, privacy issues surface as well as increased risks from such health concerns as viral infections and pandemics. On the other hand, territorial offices protect worker privacy and reduce infection risks. Unfortunately, such arrangements often hinder communication among co-workers. Although a physical office must satisfy different needs under various scenarios with limited space, the lack of flexibility in furniture designs prevents dynamic space management. In this paper, we propose a self-actuated stretchable partition whose physical height, width, and position can dynamically change to create secure workplaces (e.g., against privacy and infectious risks) without inhibiting group collaboration. To support secure workplace layouts and space reconfigurations, the partitions’ height, length, and position are adapted automatically and dynamically. First, we consider the design space of a self-actuated stretchable partition and implement a proof-of concept prototype with a height-adjustable stand, a roll-up screen, and a mobile robot. We then show some example application scenarios to discuss potential future actuated-territorial offices.},

High expectations towards automatic documentation tools also hurt user experience. How developers work and acquire information presents another challenge to the design of automatic documentation tools.

By introducing rear-seat infotainment systems especially in luxury cars, manufacturers started to also focus on the passenger’s experience. However, such systems offer mainly standard entertainment and internet-based services. To enhance the user experience of rear seat passengers, we present the concept of an interactive car door that enables passengers to engage with and explore their surroundings. Our system consists of an interactive door panel that shows points of interest along the progressing route, more detailed information is shown on the AR-enabled side window in addition to the rear seat display. Results from a pilot study (n = 11) show that our concept leads towards a positive user experience. The qualitative feedback reveals that such an interactive car door helps to make riding as a passenger more attractive and pleasant.},

We hypothesize that students in this circumstance will experience feelings of learned helplessness regarding OLT and suffer from overall poorer mental health. We present a mixed-methods study to investigate these phenomena during the Spring 2020 semester among a diverse group of students. We explore multiple factors that contributed to these phenomena, such as motivation, growing exhaustion with online learning, and feelings of connectedness that were lost and cannot be recreated via online meeting software.},

Previously, CopyCat depended on unscalable hardware such as custom gloves for sign verification, but modern 4K cameras and pose estimators present new opportunities. Before re-creating the CopyCat game for deaf children using off-the-shelf hardware, we evaluate whether current ASL recognition is sufficient. Using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), user independent word accuracies were 90.6%, 90.5%, and 90.4% for AlphaPose, Kinect, and MediaPipe, respectively. Transformers, a state-of-the-art model in natural language processing, performed 17.0% worse on average.

According to the discussion, authoring videos with typical effects takes a long time even for experienced users because they typically need to combine multiple video tracks (e.g., lyrics and videos shot from multiple angles) into a single track. They need to synchronize all tracks with the musical piece and set transitions between them at the right timing, aware of the musical structure. This paper presents Instrumeteor, an authoring tool for musical performance videos. First, it automatically analyzes the musical structure in the tracks to align them on a single timeline. Second, it implements typical video effects informed by the survey. In this way, our tool reduces manual work and unleashes the musicians’ creativity.},

Aesthetics is a key concern of philosophy, considering our perception of the natural and artefactual world. In more recent times, it has grown to consider all of our sensory perceptions of the world around us, where our encounters with everyday objects and environments are two areas of interest. Here, I explain how HCI describes aesthetics and give an overview of philosophical approaches to aesthetics, show where some common ground lies between the two, and suggest how aesthetic categorisations could work for artefacts in HCI.},

To resist this techno-deterministic eradication of the human presence from UI design, as well as radically inject the human presence back into user interfaces, we present typeFACE, a web interface and generative adversarial network designed to create fonts from human faces. We provide an implementation and applications for such a system, as well as contextualize and analyze the history of “ugliness” and the “uncanny” in UI design history. We also discuss implications of such a system within the domains of data ownership, identity, and HCI design research.},

This collective exploration inspires five pathways for approaching decoloniality within HCI: understanding, reconsidering, changing, expanding, and reflecting. Non-prescriptive and non-definitive, these pathways offer HCI researchers a framework to investigate their own practice and the spaces of sociotechnical research and learning they inhabit.},

Less discussed, however, is that the field of HCI routinely grapples with such challenges; across the various technologies commonly referred to as AI (e.g., predictive modeling, computer vision, NLP), what shared characteristics made human-AI interaction appeared uniquely difficult to design in the first place? Synthesizing my hands-on design and research over the past six years, in my dissertation, I worked to articulate whether, why, and how human-AI interaction appears uniquely challenging to design with established HCI methods. In this extended abstract, I first describe a human-AI interaction design framework as an answer to this question. I then discuss one critical implication of this framework: Framing data-driven AI systems as living socio-technical systems that co-evolve with their users. I analogize this reframing to the shift from desktop computing to ubiquitous computing and outline the ethnographic, design, and technological research opportunities it reveals.},

Although lower-risk interventions would reduce the likelihood of abandonment, previous research on digital self-control tools has left this area of study relatively unexplored. In response, this paper contributes two foundational principles relating risk and effectiveness; four widely applicable novel design patterns for reducing risk of abandonment of digital self-control tools (continuously variable interventions, anti-aging design, obligatory bundling of interventions, and intermediary control systems); and a prototype digital self-control tool that implements these four low-risk design patterns.},

However, it is unclear what types of music can help to improve focus while doing other activities. In this paper, we investigate the effects of six different music stimuli on participants’ verbal and physiological responses while identifying genuine and acted emotions from video clips. Initial analysis was conducted on the comments participants made on the different stimuli in order to identify emerging patterns. Then, participants’ verbal and EEG responses were collected, processed and analyzed to classify two types of emotion. Empirical analysis of the results show that binaural beats, which are believed to increase focus on tasks, can often cause discomfort and therefore hinder focus. On the other hand, music containing a sombre tone, or familiar popular music with high level valence can help improve focus. Identifying which music stimuli can improve focus can be highly beneficial in managing day-to-day tasks and activities. This study will also be useful in broadening the range of music stimuli used in affective computing studies.},

	abstract     = {Advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), especially the stunning achievements of Deep Learning (DL) in recent years, have shown AI/DL models possess remarkable understanding towards the logic reasoning behind the solved tasks. However, human understanding towards what knowledge is captured by deep neural networks is still elementary and this has a detrimental effect on human’s trust in the decisions made by AI systems. Explainable AI (XAI) is a hot topic in both AI and HCI communities in order to open up the blackbox to elucidate the reasoning processes of AI algorithms in such a way that makes sense to humans. However, XAI is only half of human-AI interaction and research on the other half - human’s feedback on AI explanations together with AI making sense of the feedback - is generally lacking. Human cognition is also a blackbox to AI and effective human-AI interaction requires unveiling both blackboxes to each other for mutual sensemaking. The main contribution of this paper is a conceptual framework for supporting effective human-AI interaction, referred to as interactive and continuous sensemaking (HAICS). We further implement this framework in an image classification application using deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifiers as a browser-based tool that displays network attention maps to the human for explainability and collects human’s feedback in the form of scribble annotations overlaid onto the maps. Experimental results using a real-world dataset has shown significant improvement of classification accuracy (the AI performance) with the HAICS framework.},

Experimental results revealed that AR improved brand recall and recognition by creating an engaging environment. Moreover, participants in the AR context recalled additional information about the product. Also, the AR experience motivated them to participate in an omnichannel activity based on a QR interaction. These results show the influence of well-designed AR experiences on brand recall and recognition opening the possibility for new technology in retail environments.},

Despite their promising accuracy, DNNs are often seen as ’black boxes’ by physicians unfamiliar with the technology. In this paper, we present EyeXplain Autism, an interactive system that enables physicians to analyse eye tracking data, perform automated diagnosis and interpret DNN predictions. Here we discuss the design, development and sample scenario to illustrate the potential of our system to aid in ASD diagnosis. Unlike existing eye tracking software, our system combines traditional eye tracking visualisation and analysis tools with a data-driven knowledge to enhance medical decision-making for physicians.},

Here we show how they can manifest as “socially embodied AI.” We define this as the state that embodied AI “circumstantially” take on within interactive contexts when perceived as both social and agentic by people. We offer a working ontology that describes how embodied AI can dynamically transition into socially embodied AI. We propose an ontological heuristic for describing the threshold: the Tepper line. We reinforce our theoretical work with expert insights from a card sort workshop. We end with two case studies to illustrate the dynamic and contextual nature of this heuristic.},

To find a way to counter this problem, we propose a virtual reality training simulation. The corresponding use case is exemplified by a priming procedure of a dialysis machine. This is achieved by users going through sequential interaction tasks in Virtual Reality Training using a head-mounted display. We evaluate this training method’s potential within a user study, comparing it to traditional training methods, Group Training, and Video Training. Our findings demonstrate that Virtual Reality Training using a head-mounted display is a more effective and efficient method of learning how to prime a dialysis machine. Compared to other training methods, Virtual Reality Training takes longer on average, but the resulting learning effect is also higher. Furthermore, VR-training is more cost-effective than personal training and can be repeatedly performed as it dispenses with the need for teaching professionals.},

In this paper, we argue for adopting research approaches from decision theory for HCI research on XAI interface design. We outline how we used estimation tasks in human-grounded design research in order to introduce a method and measurement for collecting evidence on XAI interface effects.

Collaborative causal modelling can help teams craft better plans, but there are unique challenges in developing synchronous collaboration tools for building and using causal models. Collaboration systems typically organize information around varying degrees of synchronization between data “values” and user “views.” Our contribution is in extending this collaboration framework to include analytics as layers that are by nature derived from the data values but utilized and displayed temporarily as private views. We describe how Causeworks overlays analytics inputs and outputs over a shared causal model to flexibly support multiple modeling tasks simultaneously in a collaborative environment with minimal state management burden on users.},

Therefore, this study proposes a blind football play-by-play system, combining a tactile graphic display function and a position acquisition function, to aid visually impaired spectators understand game developments. To conduct a basic study, an experimental system was developed herein, which detects the positions of the players and ball using image processing technology and deep learning, and shows these positions via a refreshable tactile display. The validity of the proposed system was then established through subjective experiments. This system provides a rich user experience to the spectators as well as being a powerful feedback tool to the players. Moreover, an audio–tactile graphic system, which can be used to overcome tactile cognitive limitations, can be implemented as an application of the system in the future.},

Is this appreciated or perceived as eerie and intrusive, thereby negatively affecting doctor-patient interaction? We decided to find out by designing a healthcare chatbot that identified itself as AI, Human, or Human assisted by AI. In a user study assessing Covid-19 risk, participants interacted twice, 10 days apart, with a bot that either individuated them or not. Data show that individuation by an AI doctor lowers patient compliance. Surprisingly, a majority of participants in the human doctor condition thought that they chatted with an AI doctor.

In this paper, we propose a novel micro-game concept that enables the gamification of micro-breaks within working hours. To examine our concept, we adapted a conventional water-ring game into an interactive prototype, InterRings, which empowers users to play with handy objects. Our mixed observational studies and interviews revealed high acceptability and feasibility of the micro-game concept. Conclusively, three design guidelines are summarised for future development of micro-games.},

This reduces their motivation to embrace such systems, resulting in low adoption rates. In our research, we examined user perception of adopting PLMS in the workplace through a series of focus group discussions and an online survey guided by findings from the focus group discussions.

In this paper, we proposed to employ the simulated sensor to generate the corresponding signal from human motion animation as the dataset. Visualizing the corresponding items from the real world, the user can determine the sensor’s placement arbitrarily and obtain accuracy feedback as well as the classifier interface to get relief from the cost of a conventional training model. With the cases validation, the classifier trained by simulated sensor data can effectively recognize the real-world activity.},

We conducted semi-structured interviews with 15 older adults living alone in community-dwellings to understand the influence of the pandemic on their experiences of autonomy. Our findings show that even though older adults experienced limited autonomy due to extrinsic (e.g., government regulation, influence of others) and intrinsic (e.g., risk perception) factors, they experienced new opportunities for autonomy through engagement in various self-chosen activities at home.

	abstract     = {To protect the password from visual attacks, most password entry screens use a password masking scheme that displays a series of placeholder characters (e.g., dots and asterisks) instead of the actual password. Recent research has however shown the security provided by this form of password masking to be weak against keystroke timing-analytics attacks. The underlying idea behind these attacks is that, even when a password is masked as described above, the timing between consecutive placeholder characters gives away information about the password since the relative locations of characters on the keyboard dictate how fast fingers move between them. In this paper we argue that, for security-sensitive applications, password masking mechanisms ought to hide the true intervals between password characters in order to overcome these kinds of attacks. Making adjustments to these timings however has the potential to pose usability issues given the fact that the typing would not perfectly align with the display of typed content. The paper proposes 3 different password masking schemes and undertakes a usability evaluation on them. Our early results suggest that user receptiveness to two of the schemes is not much worse than that seen with the conventional (insecure) scheme.},

We believe that smartwatches, as widely used personal devices, could provide a platform for accessible, flexible, and unobtrusive integration of haptic feedback into mid-air gesture interaction. We prototyped a vibrotactile wrist band with four vibration actuators aiming at communicating invisible, undetectable virtual object properties such as electricity, weight, and tension into 3D haptic experiences. In this paper, we present findings from a user study (n=18) that examined the suitability of different vibration patterns (variation in intensity, temporal profile, rhythm, and location). Results show that all feedback variants have a positive impact on user experience (UX) when interacting with virtual objects. Constant, continuous patterns outweigh the other variants examined.},

Preliminary research in the area demonstrates that inter-brain synchrony in virtual environments can be achieved in a manner similar to that seen in the real world. The study described in this paper proposes to further research in the area by studying how non-verbal communication cues in social interactions in virtual environments can affect inter-brain synchrony.

Moreover, our demo features 1) mid-air haptics for conveying Braille information, 2) responsive button magnification to assist people with low vision, 3) intuitive gestures for opening or closing doors, and 4) audio feedback.

However, providing an experience of building things remotely is not easy because of the time and cost of preparing materials and equipment, and the difficulties of distance teaching. So, we designed a kinetic toy kit that can be sent in an envelope, be constructed with ease, and work without any batteries. The kinetic toy, constructed using magnetic sheets, cardboard, and paper, allows the users to design and create “animals” with variable motions. At the two online workshops we held for 15 participants from 3 to 11 years old, all of the children enjoyed building toys and some participants invented original mechanisms and new animals.

To investigate this issue, we designed a simple shooting game with two ‘fake enemy bullets’: Unreachable Bullets and Non-collisionable Bullets, which do not damage the player character. The experiment suggests that the non-collisionable bullet can efficiently increase the perceived difficulty level but the unreachable bullet does not. Such a study in novel techniques that can control the perceived difficulty without changing the actual difficulty could contribute to both research and practices in game design.},

	abstract     = {Classes involving physical making were severely disrupted by COVID-19. As workshops, makerspaces, and fab labs shut down in Spring 2020, instructors developed new models for teaching physical prototyping, electronics production, and digital fabrication at a distance. Instructors shipped materials and equipment directly to students, converted makerspaces to job-shops, and substituted low-tech construction methods and hobbyist equipment for industrial tools. The experiences of students and instructors during the pandemic highlighted new learning opportunities when making outside the makerspace. Simultaneously, the shutdown raised new questions on the limits of remote learning for digital fabrication, electronics, and manual craft. This panel brings together experts in making to discuss their experiences teaching physical production in art, design, and engineering during the pandemic. Panelists will discuss their teaching strategies, describe what worked and what did not, and argue for how we can best support students learning hands-on skills going forward.},

	abstract     = {HCI research has for long been dedicated to better and more naturally facilitating information transfer between humans and machines. Unfortunately, humans' most natural form of communication, speech, is also one of the most difficult modalities to be understood by machines – despite, and perhaps, because it is the highest-bandwidth communication channel we possess. While significant research efforts, from engineering, to linguistic, and to cognitive sciences, have been spent on improving machines' ability to understand speech, the CHI community (and the HCI field at large) has only recently started embracing this modality as a central focus of research. This can be attributed in part to the unexpected variations in error rates when processing speech, in contrast with often-unfounded claims of success from industry, but also to the intrinsic difficulty of designing and especially evaluating speech and natural language interfaces. As such, the development of interactive speech-based systems is mostly driven by engineering efforts to improve such systems with respect to largely arbitrary performance metrics. Such developments have often been void of any user-centered design principles or consideration for usability or usefulness in the same ways as graphical user interfaces have benefited from heuristic design guidelines.The goal of this course is to inform the CHI community of the current state of speech and natural language research, to dispel some of the myths surrounding speech-based interaction, as well as to provide an opportunity for researchers and practitioners to learn more about how speech recognition and speech synthesis work, what are their limitations, and how they could be used to enhance current interaction paradigms. Through this, we hope that HCI researchers and practitioners will learn how to combine recent advances in speech processing with user-centred principles in designing more usable and useful speech-based interactive systems.},

	abstract     = {This case study involves: the design and evaluation of serious games; the use of longitudinal research and remote testing in an international setting. Current methods for cognitive assessment tend to be inconvenient, costly and infrequently performed. This is unfortunate because cognitive assessment is an important tool. In the young it can detect atypical development, and in older people it can detect cognitive decline. For both young and old, cognitive assessments can identify problems and trigger interventions for reducing harms (e.g., adverse reactions to drugs) or providing treatment. Serious games for cognitive assessment can potentially be self-administered and played on an on-going basis so as to track cognitive status over time, something that is not practical with current methods. Inspired by this opportunity the BrainTagger team has developed a suite of cognitive assessment games. Studies are being carried out to assess the validity of these games for measuring the cognitive functions that they target, but those studies don't address the issue of whether people will be willing to play the game repeatedly, without supervision, over an extended period of time. Thus we carried out a longitudinal study with BrainTagger. We report on the logistical challenges of running this study with an international team located in Canada and Japan during the COVID19 pandemic. We also report on how the perceived “fun” of games changed over time. Our games were all versions of Whack-a-mole games, with each game requiring a different cognitive function to distinguish between targets (moles to hit) and distractors (moles to avoid). While the basic Whack-a-mole game is fun to play, having to play the same games again and again over a larger time period appeared to be more challenging than anticipated and motivation and acceptance seemed to gradually decrease over the course of the study. We conclude that addition of gamification features, such as leaderboards and in-game rewards, are needed to sustain enjoyment of our BrainTagger games and likely other games as well.},

Traditionally, UX is retrieved in a written questionnaire as a satisfaction survey, nevertheless, with the hike in electronic devices equipped with a diversity of sensors, actuators and processing capabilities (turning everyday appliances into robots) comes an intention to migrate from qualitative to quantitative assessment of the UX; for example, visual recognition of emotional facial expressions. In this regard, what I present as a novelty in the research area is the study of interaction data generated through the robot’s interface during its intended use (everyday use), while providing an anonymous experience (no cameras, no mics) to the user. For the experimental setup, I designed and built a robotic Desk-Lamp with 5 degrees of freedom (height, brightness, projection angle, sensitivity of the interface and ambient lighting) as test bench, equipped with: an interface instrumented to sense the force delivered by the user while “pushing buttons”; 18 variable data-logging system at 20 SPS (Sample Per Second); high precision and high repeatability electronics and mechanisms; real-time sensing of the user and low-latency operation due to parallel processing. The test bench is designed to be used in multiple experiments with users, varying the robot behavior and interaction procedures to compare the interaction data generated in the interface with a written UX questionnaire.},

Nowadays, it is commonly evaluated using subjective measures, which most of the time take the form of questionnaires. However, there have been doubts about whether measures of this type are able to truly capture the actual concept behind presence (if it exists, although this is highly likely). While working on my master’s thesis, I found that it is quite difficult in practice to purposefully employ more objective measures into specific experimental designs. This is why I decided to dedicate myself to contributing ways to make this easier for as many scenarios as possible. My current work involves advanced pattern recognition and general methods from digital signal processing to analyze objective, continuous sensory data like eye-tracking and electromyography.},

This workshop aims to explore the possibility of bringing practitioners, researchers and theorists together to discuss the future of human-food interaction with a particular highlight on the design of experiential aspects of human-food interactions beyond the instrumental. This workshop extends prior community building efforts in this area and hence explicitly invites submissions concerning the empirically-informed knowledge of how technologies can enrich eating experiences.

The system responds in context to the user’s specific and immediate feedback to make sequential recommendations. We envision our system would be highly useful in situations with intrinsic constraints, such as finding the right restaurant within walking distance or the right retail item within a limited inventory. Our research prototype instantiates the former use case, leveraging real data from Google Places, Yelp, and Zomato. We evaluated our system against a similar system that did not incorporate user feedback in a 16 person remote study, generating 64 scenario-based search journeys. When our recommendation system was successfully triggered, we saw both an increase in efficiency and a higher confidence rating with respect to final user choice. We also found that users preferred our system (75%) compared with the baseline.},

However, discovering biases against different intersectional groups remains a challenging task. In this work, we present WordBias, an interactive visual tool designed to explore biases against intersectional groups encoded in static word embeddings. Given a pretrained static word embedding, WordBias computes the association of each word along different groups like race, age, etc. and then visualizes them using a novel interactive interface. Using a case study, we demonstrate how WordBias can help uncover biases against intersectional groups like Black Muslim Males, Poor Females, etc. encoded in word embedding.

	abstract     = {Companion robots have been suggested as a promising technology for older adults who experience loneliness. However, healthy older adults commonly reject robots designed to be an ”artificial friend”. We follow the approach of ”companionship as a secondary function”, in which a non-humanoid robot is designed with a primary function that older adults perceive as appropriate, and a secondary function of companionship. In a Zoom-based exploratory need-study we unfold how older adults perceive the various aspects of a robot’s ”companionship” as a secondary function. Our qualitative analysis reveals several use cases that older adults find to be appropriate for their daily routine, and classify them into three high-level categories: companionship as ”attentive to me”, companionship as ”looking after me”, and companionship as ”experiencing together with me”. Our findings indicate that robot companionship, when designed as a secondary function, is perceived by older adults as a multifaceted social experience.},

EMS is a promising technique for force feedback because of its small form factor when compared to mechanical actuators. However, the current EMS approach to flexing the user's fingers (i.e., attaching electrodes to the base of the forearm, where finger muscles anchor) cannot flex one finger alone at the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint, they always induce unwanted actuation to adjacent fingers. To tackle the lack of dexterity, we propose a new electrode layout that places the electrodes on the back of the hand, where they stimulate the interossei/lumbricals muscles in the palm, which have never received attention with regards to EMS. We demonstrate the improved dexterity with a series of EMS-assisted music applications for playing piano, drums, and guitar.},

When the user's finger wearing our voice-coil contacts any of the interactive patches it detects its magnetic signature via magnetometer and vibrates the patch, adding haptic feedback to otherwise input-only interactions. To allow these passive patches to vibrate, we make them from silicone with regions doped with polarized neodymium powder, resulting in soft and stretchable magnets. This stretchable form-factor allows them to be wrapped to the user's body or everyday objects of various shapes. We demonstrate how these add haptic output to many situations, such as adding haptic buttons to the walls of one's home.},

Through conducting a study involving three different email platform prototypes based on the Gmail platform, we evaluate how varying levels of platform intervention affect users’ perceived sense of safety, agency, and trust with their email platform. Our primary findings suggest that users generally benefited from each of the system intervention strategies and desired higher intervention features when combating email harassment, as well as ways of managing this intervention based on their unique preferences.},

The goal of this work is to address this knowledge gap: to better understand the high-level authoring patterns that statically-typed functional programmers engage in. I did a grounded theory analysis of thirteen programming sessions of practicing functional programmers, eight of which also included a semi-structured interview. The theory I developed gives insight into how the specific affordances of statically-typed functional programming affect domain modeling, type construction, focusing techniques, exploratory strategies, mental models, and expressions of intent. The success of this approach in revealing program authorship patterns suggests that the same methodology could be used to study other understudied programmer audiences.},

By this paradigm, researchers aim at establishing highly sophisticated or efficient design processes that otherwise cannot be achieved. Target domains include graphics, personal fabrication, user interface, etc. This course introduces fundamental concepts in computational design and provides an overview of the recent trend. It then goes into a more specific case where human assessment is necessary to evaluate the quality of design outcomes, which is often true in HCI scenarios. This course is recommended to HCI students and researchers who are new to this topic.},

In this paper, we describe how we designed and conducted four user-centered design activities from our homes: participatory design workshops, near-live simulation sessions, usability evaluation sessions, and interviews and design walkthroughs. We discuss the differences we observed in our interactions with participants in remote sessions, as well as the differences in the interactions among the research team members.

I develop new student-centered pedagogical scenarios with empirically evaluated design principles, linguistic corpora, ML algorithms, and innovative learning tools based on an adaptive writing support system and a pedagogical conversational agent. My results indicate that adaptive learning tools based on ML algorithms and user-centered design patterns help students to develop better argumentation writing skills. Thereby, I contribute to research by bridging the boundaries of argumentation learning and argumentation mining and by examining pedagogical scenarios for adaptive argumentation learning from a user-centered perspective.},

Besides visual and auditory feedback, other senses like haptics, smell and taste can enhance immersion in virtual environments. Most solutions presented in the past require specialized hardware to provide appropriate feedback. To mitigate this need, researchers conceptualized approaches leveraging everyday physical objects as proxies instead. Transferring these approaches to varying physical environments and conditions, however, poses significant challenges to a variety of disciplines such as HCI, VR, haptics, tracking, perceptual science, design, etc. This workshop will explore the integration of everyday items for multi-sensory feedback in virtual experiences and sets course for respective future research endeavors. Since the community still seems to lack a cohesive agenda for advancing this domain, the goal of this workshop is to bring together individuals interested in everyday proxy objects to review past work, build a unifying research agenda, share ongoing work, and encourage collaboration.},

However, video-mediated communication has several limitations related to exchanging vocal reactions and non-verbal expressions. Consequently, although current video conferencing platforms provide visual support through icons, it remains challenging for users to express various intentions because of the limited number of icons, their uniform size, and their fixed location. In particular, these limitations challenge designers who require collaborative design processes such as brainstorming. To investigate user needs related to icons that better support video-mediated communication, we conducted a participatory design methodology. Based on the analyses of participants’ brainstorming experiences with various icons through participatory paper prototyping, we found that icons that accurately reflect diverse user needs facilitated turn-taking during the design process, and allowed participants to exchange more opinions and emotions. Thus, they created a positive atmosphere in the online meeting environment.},

By means of a focus group (N=6) and a subsequent online survey (N=36), we gathered individual notions of presence as well as experiences and situations in which people move between the worlds.

We employ a hybrid region-based and line-based scheme, which allows placing a representative image of each set data item at its region position and helps reduce visual clutter by line connection design. Energy optimization is exploited to compute the layouts of region-based set data items (balloons) and connected lines. The case study and the user study suggest the BalloonVis can visualize set data with more information. Besides, the proposed hierarchical scheme is more scalable on set data item size.},

We thus apply the bibliometric analysis to gain insights from the published literature. Our work outlines the trend of how the number of studies about AI agent transparency increased over the years. We also identify the major application topics and issues in designing transparent AI agents. Furthermore, we categorize the identified applications according to the specific dimensions (risk and timeliness) and put forward potential strategies for designing different agents.

	abstract     = {Enabling healthier online deliberation around issues of public concerns is an increasingly vital challenge in nowadays society. Two fundamental components of a healthier deliberation are: i. the capability of people to make sense of what they read, so that their contribution can be relevant; and ii. the improvement of the overall quality of the debate, so that noise can be reduced and useful signals can inform collective decision making. Platform designers often resort to computational aids to improve these two processes. In this paper, we examine automated reporting as promising mean of improving sensemaking in discussion platforms. We compared three approaches to automated reporting: an abstractive summariser, a template report and an argumentation highlighting system. We then evaluated improvements in sensemaking of participants and the perception on overall quality of the debate. The study suggests that argument mining technologies are particularly promising computational aids to improve sense making and perceived quality of online discussion, thanks to their capability to combine computational models for automated reasoning with users’ cognitive needs and expectation of automated reporting.},

	abstract     = {Since the advent of augmented reality, video game representations have been extended beyond the display. Many studies have used real objects to assist in the presentation of visual and haptic information, resulting in video games that are integrated with reality. Researchers often use tangibles UIs as a method to extend visual and haptic information presentation, but they commonly use speakers for auditory information presentation, and tangibles UIs dealing with real objects have few applications except for some music applications. In this study, we developed a device that presents game sound effects using real object sound sources. By assigning a real object sound source to each of the game sound effects, not only can auditory information be presented instead of speakers, but also a tangible UI can be realized where the user can access the video game by touching the sound source. We named this tangible UI as Tangible-Auditory User Interface (t-AUI), referring to GUI, and CLI. The production of t-AUI will enable the application of tangible UI to sound generating devices such as holding down and blocking the output of video game sound effects with hands, and reproducing sound effects with real objects for video game operation.},

The design space combines a dimension for object types of animation techniques with one for narrative intents served by such animation techniques. We derived our design space from the analysis of 121 high-quality animated illustrations collected from online sources. To evaluate the effectiveness of our design space, we ran a workshop with 18 participants. The results of our workshop indicated that the design space can be used as a tool that supports ideation and increases creativity for designing expressive animated illustrations.},

Yet an open question remains: how do we know our interventions successfully target the mechanisms we intend? We present results from two validation studies and one user study showing the difficulties of ensuring that behavior change interventions target the mechanisms designers intend. Our findings indicate that experts disagree about what mechanism an intervention targets, that expert consensus on this matter can be hard to achieve, and that end users’ reflections indicate they may follow different mechanisms than those predicted by experts. We recommend that researchers collect data about multiple potential mechanisms that their intervention could operate through, rather than the common single-mechanism approach.},

The solution consists of a wireless push button that via a simple click can launch a video on a device such as a smartphone or a tablet. A trusted person like a family member or carer can appear in the video to illustrate how to complete certain activities of interest to the end-user. The button can be placed anywhere where support is needed, e.g. on a washing machine or at the kitchen table. We conducted workshops and online discussions with social and healthcare organizations, potential end-users (people with learning disabilities and older adults), and their carers.

In this work, we aim to address this two-fold problem by crowdsourcing visualization experiments. We developed VisLab, an online platform in which anyone can design and deploy experiments to evaluate their visualizations. To alleviate the complexity of experiment design and analysis, our platform provides scaffold templates and analytic dashboards. To motivate broad participation in the experiments, the platform enables anonymous participation and provides personalized performance feedback. We present use case scenarios that demonstrate the usability and usefulness of the platform in addressing the different needs of practitioners, researchers, and educators.},

To bridge this gap we designed Sensation, a sonified running track that provides sensations of nature using audio feedback. Sensation senses the footsteps of runners and produces synced sounds of footsteps in several nature environments to augment the urban landscape. This way, Sensation aims to enhance the environmental factors that contribute to the positive feelings people experience during a run.

Based on the interviews with 6 participants from immigrant families to Canada, we found that immigrant families’ discourse on IM platforms is motivated by love and care for other family members. The families used local and international sources of information, judged information credibility by its alignment with their pre-existing knowledge, and mostly did not verify information further. The information shared by different users from different sources often contradicted one another. Yet, family members did not discuss the conflicting information due to their desire to avoid tensions.},

	abstract     = {In order to better understand human emotion, we should not recognize only superficial emotions based on facial images, but also analyze so-called inner emotions by considering biological signals such as electroencephalogram (EEG). Recently, several studies to analyze a person’s inner state by using an image signal and an EEG signal together have been reported. However, there have been no studies dealing with the case where the emotions estimated from the image signal and the EEG signal are different, i.e., emotional mismatch. This paper defines a new task to detect hidden emotions, i.e., emotions in a situation where only the EEG signal is activated without the image signal being activated, and proposes a method to effectively detect the hidden emotions. First, when a subject hides the emotion intentionally, the internal and external emotional characteristics of the subject were analyzed from the viewpoint of multimodal signals. Then, based on the analysis, we designed a method of detecting hidden emotions using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that exhibit powerful cognitive ability. As a result, this study has upgraded the technology of deeply understanding inner emotions. On the other hand, the hidden emotion dataset and source code that we have built ourselves will be officially released for future emotion recognition research.},

	abstract     = {Nowadays, with the advent of electronic devices in everyday life, mobile devices can be utilized for learning purposes. When designing a mobile-based learning application, a large number of aspects should be taken into account. For the present paper, the following aspects are of special importance: first, it should be considered how to represent information; second, possible interactions between learner and system should be defined; third – and depending on the second aspect – it should be considered how real-time responses can be provided by the system. Moreover, psychological theories as for example the 4C/ID model and findings with respect to blended learning environments should be taken into account. In this paper, a mobile-based learning prototype concerning the learning topic ”logic circuit design” is presented which considers the mentioned aspects to support independent practice. The prototype includes four different representations: (i) code-based (Verilog hardware description language), (ii) graphical-based (gate-level view), (iii) Boolean function, and (iv) truth table for each gate. The proposed learning system divides the learning content into different sections to support independent practice in meaningful steps. Multiple representations are included in order to foster understanding and transfer. The resulting implications for future work are discussed.},

Our method addresses a major problem of conventional music controllers: differences in the tactile feel of keys compared to the player’s own instrument.

Our study resulted in 14 design concepts that were synthesized into three design themes that include 9 sub-themes, namely Virtual Costumes, Modification of Bodily Perception and Social Bioadaptivity.

And yet, there remain many gaps in our knowledge of just how students perceive and desire their engagement with these devices – leading to a lack of real-world design solutions to enable configuration of these vital human-device relationships. This paper presents a design-led inquiry into the role smartphones play in students’ lives; contributing findings from five phases of mixed-methods research conducted as part of a user-centred, iterative design process (n=157), and resulting in a novel scaffolding of the mobile app ecosystem in support of the modes of engagement students desire.},

Our data shows that there are differences in what parts of the code people consider of interest and how they read it. This is a consequence of differences in both syntax and semantics of the code. This reading behaviour already shows that we cannot take existing solutions as universally applicable.

This technique seeks to help navigation and promote spatial learning. We conducted a pilot study with five participants to compare the directional arrows with VGL.

Moreover, iterations of such models can be time-consuming tasks and sometimes limiting depending on the the design stage, as major changes in the layout design may result in remodeling the entire parametric definition. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel automated generative design system, which takes a basic floor plan sketch as an input and provides a parametric model prepared for multi-objective building optimization as output. In addition, the user-designer can assign various design variables for its desired building elements by using simple annotations in the drawing. We take advantage of a asymmetric convolutional module combined with a parametrizer to allow real-time parametric sketch-retrieval for a performance-based generative workflow. The system would recognize the corresponding element and define variable constraints to prepare for a multi-objective optimization problem. We illustrate the the use case of our proposed system by running a real-time structural optimization form-finding study. Our findings indicate the system can be utilized as a promising generative design tool for novice users.},

This study conducted a needs assessment study to gain guidelines for incorporating virtual reality and biofeedback technologies to assist psychotherapists in raising patients’ awareness and identifying their cues in psychotherapy. Our results identify current difficulties to reinforce mind-body awareness and correct attributions of craving stimuli. Also, we summarized concerns and the potential to promote the effectiveness of psychotherapy when applying virtual reality and biofeedback technologies to induce cravings. We also proposed a preliminary design of technology solutions to incorporate clinical-friendly VR-based craving inducing along with real-time biofeedback for enabling psychotherapists to jointly review the induced craving events based on the collected information.},

	abstract     = {The understanding of situation-based emotions is of great significance for children, as it is able to assist children to better understand other people's behaviors in certain emotional scenarios and also to understand how their behaviors and actions can affect others. However, children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) might have difficulties associating situations with emotions. In this paper, we presented the design of DailyConnect, a visual-based mobile application that supports children with ASDs to recall memories by reviewing photos based on their personal experience, and then taught by their teachers to understand situation-based emotions. There are two types of user modes for parents and teachers respectively in the system. For parents, the system enables them to upload daily-life photos associated with descriptions of contexts and behaviors of the child. For teachers, the system enables them to guide the children to recall what happened by reviewing the uploaded photos, and adopts the Discrete Trial Training (DTT) teaching technique to help the children understand situation-based emotions. Through recalling the memories of the children's real-life experience, the system enables teachers and parents to help children build emotions and situations associations step by step, including the understanding of contexts, emotional cues, emotions recognition, facial expression recognition and learn expected responses. Moreover, the system can provide individual feedback for each child to achieve targeted training after a long-term use: by analyzing of the data recording of the children (if with their consent), the system is able to generate reports on which step of the understanding situation-based emotions needs attention for each child respectively.},

FingerMapper works as an alternative function while the environment is not allowed for full arm interaction and enables users to interact inside a small physical, but larger virtual space.

To explore this, we engineered an interactive system, which we call ElectricAuth, that stimulates the user’s forearm muscles with a sequence of electrical impulses (i.e., EMS challenge) and measures the user’s involuntary finger movements (i.e., response to the challenge). ElectricAuth leverages EMS’s intersubject variability, where the same electrical stimulation results in different movements in different users because everybody’s physiology is unique (e.g., differences in bone and muscular structure, skin resistance and composition, etc.). As such, ElectricAuth allows users to login without memorizing passwords or PINs. ElectricAuth’s challenge-response structure makes it secure against data breaches and replay attacks, a major vulnerability facing today’s biometrics such as facial recognition and fingerprints. Furthermore, ElectricAuth never reuses the same challenge twice in authentications – in just one second of stimulation it encodes one of 68M possible challenges.},

The system combines Hololens augmented reality, 3D Kinect cameras, PC and virtual reality interfaces, into a virtual space that hosts remote collaborators, and physical &amp; virtual objects.When talented people have access to fabrication tools and expertise, incredible inventions can be manifested to solve local and global problems. Because of this, the “maker movement” is a growing phenomenon, manifested through the increased number of maker spaces in many affluent communities. However, many talented individuals lack access to resources in their local communities, and collaboration opportunities with remote experts are wasted due to the limitations of current teleconferencing systems. We present a mixed-reality (MR) system for enabling remote collaborations in the context of maker activities, that allows groups of students and instructors to discuss, explore, create and learn about physical objects. The system combines augmented reality (AR) headsets, 3D cameras, PC and virtual reality (VR) interfaces, into a virtual space that contains multiple remote students, instructors, physical and virtual objects. Remote students can see a real-time 3D scan of the on-site user's physical environment, and the virtual avatars of other students. The system can support learning and exploration by showing virtual overlays on real objects (ex: showing a physical robot's sensor data or internal circuitry) while responding to real-time manipulation of physical objects by the on-site user; and can support design activities by allowing remote and local participants to annotate physical objects with virtual drawings and virtual models. This platform is being developed as an open-source project, and we are currently building applications with the intention to deploy in hybrid makerspace classrooms involving on-site and remote students.},

Our illusion relies on the properties of certain scents, such as the coolness of mint or hotness of peppers. These odors trigger not only the olfactory bulb, but also the nose's trigeminal nerve, which has receptors that respond to both temperature and chemicals. The second is a novel type of olfactory device that creates a stereo-smell experience, i.e., directional information about the location of an odor, by rendering the readings of external odor sensors as trigeminal sensations using electrical stimulation of the user's nasal septum. We propose that electrically stimulating the trigeminal nerve is an ideal candidate for stereo-smell rendering. We demonstrate these interfaces by allowing an audience to stimulate an author and receive an explanation of the sensations.},

To achieve multimodal gesture sensing with a simpler configuration, a novel soft sensor consisting of a conductive foam with a single wire, was proposed in this study. This sensor was named as foamin and utilizes an impedance measurement technique at multiple frequencies called foamin. Additionally, a surface-shielding method was designed for improving the detection performance of the sensor. Several patterns of foamin were implemented to investigate the detection accuracy and three application scenarios based on the sensor were proposed.},

Additionally, our system supports simple bi-directional avatar interaction as well as panoramic video zoom. This makes interaction in the normally constrained remote task space more flexible and relatively natural.

The three approaches are broadly related to humanitarian action (karma yoga), love and devotion (bhakti yoga) and introspective insight (jnana yoga). Each offers a different perspective on our HCI practice, and how the practical challenge of being a researcher can be reframed as part of a spiritual path. It suggests approaches to issues such as emotional burnout and bias-awareness. It is based on teachings given by major Indian teachers.},

Activities included drawing, writing and performing and were framed by a single story that took participants on a journey through time: past, present and future.

This spike in technological growth exponentially increased the need for a human performance metric in 3D space. Fitts’ law is perhaps the most widely used human prediction model in HCI history attempting to capture human movement in lower dimensions. Despite the collective effort towards deriving an advanced extension of a 3D human performance model based on Fitts’ law, a standardized metric is still missing. Moreover, most of the extensions to date assume or limit their findings to certain settings, effectively disregarding important variables that are fundamental to 3D object interaction. In this review, we investigate and analyze the most prominent extensions of Fitts’ law and compare their characteristics pinpointing to potentially important aspects for deriving a higher-dimensional performance model. Lastly, we mention the complexities, frontiers as well as potential challenges that may lay ahead.},

The results of this study cast light on the recommended cycle of design thinking and customer-centered design in VR. Especially in interdisciplinary rapid prototyping conditions, where stakeholders initially do not share competences. They also showcase educational benefits of working in transdisciplinary environments. This study, combined with our previous work on human factors in rapid software development and co-design, including hackathon dynamics, allowed us to formulate recommendations for organizing content creation VR hackathons for specific purposes.

Therefore, it is unclear how HWDs affect EMS work and patient outcomes. During my PhD studies, I am investigating the potential of HWDs in EMS.

The goal of this workshop is to examine how human-centered perspectives in XAI can be operationalized at the conceptual, methodological, and technical levels.

	abstract     = {I remember when I started my DPhil studies joking with friends that my research was improving the sum total of human happiness – by one. I was enjoying the work. It was as a post-doc, however, that I began to see how knowledge, or at the very least the pursuit of knowledge, is not neutral. The things that we choose to study, the problems that we choose to focus on, and the way we frame our questions, lead towards different benefits for different interests. If we want to make a better world, then perhaps we should focus on asking better questions.One question that was a turning point for me was posed by Steve Walker in 2002. In a world where e-commerce and e-government already had thriving, well-financed research communities, he convened a workshop asking “Can there be a Social Movement Informatics?” The topics ranged from designing with voluntary organizations and trade-unions, to investigating hate speech in Internet bulletin boards and chat rooms. Together with colleagues, we ran projects around “Design for Civil Society”, and “Technology and Social Action”, exploring how we as technologists, designers and researchers can connect and collaborate more effectively with groups promoting social change.Following on from that work, I won an opportunity to explore how participatory approaches in international social and economic development relate to understandings of participatory design in HCI. Working with the Sironj Crop Producers Company Ltd (a co-operative of small and marginal farmers in Madhya Pradesh, India) and Safal Solutions (a small software house focused on rural development, based in Telengana, India), this was my first attempt to apply participatory design methods in a context with very limited infrastructure and resources. How can we facilitate meaningful communications about priorities and possibilities across wide social, cultural, geographical, linguistic, experiential and economic divides? How does the way we arrange, organize and conduct projects aiming to advance ‘development’ affect the outputs, the outcomes and the impacts that are achieved? How can agency, creativity and control be shared in ways that move systems towards a more just world?I don't know all the answers to those questions, but I have learned that the inequalities of this world are far greater than I had originally imagined. I started with high hopes that expertise in participatory design, together with a commitment to participatory development would deliver radical results. I discovered that true participation and reciprocity is tougher than I thought. We cannot communicate effectively across such huge social divides without questioning, acknowledging and responding to our own positionality in the wider context. For example, we should ask how our own actions are contributing to harming others, such as the millions who will become, or are already, climate refugees? A few short-term “bungee research” visits will not lead us to real understanding. When key decision making remains in the usual centers of power, that simply reinforces the neo-colonial arrangements that underpin the marginalization that we say we want to change.To create a future for humanity as part of life on this planet, we must see changes in behavior close to centers of power – and that includes ourselves. We are already enmeshed in a system of unjust socio-economic relationships. “The problem” is not something that is “out there”, it is also “in here” and all around us. Are we asking the questions that really matter?},

The goal of the game is to allow players to virtually encounter different anxiety-causing situations and provide constructive measures to deal with negative feelings following the ABC-model of CBT (antecedent, belief, consequence) along with disputation and new effect. The storyline's foundation focuses on four emotion regulation strategies common in GAD: catastrophizing, rumination, denial, and lack of refocus on planning. Each strategy consists of three scenarios that simulate real-life occurrences where GAD patients might find them hard to overcome. CBT elements are integrated with the diegetic components implemented in the game to provide psychoeducation in a fun way, which can be used to complement counseling.},

We examine the intersection of drones and play and explore how drones can facilitate playful bodily experiences by pervading the physical space. We focus on “Paida” play to build explorative play experiences that pervade the player's physical environment. This work resulted in three play experiences built around simple interaction methods, in addition to observations from our design process, and three design strategies; drone-based play lends itself to collaborative play, such play benefits from simple designs, and designers benefit from designing for multiple players. From these design strategies, we set a starting point for designing novel, pervasive, and playful interactions whilst regarding drones as pixels in the physical space.},

ActPad accounts for different ways of controlling IoT devices by enabling various modes of interaction – in particular simultaneous, sequential, implicit and explicit – and, hence, a rich input space.

We asked a small number of participants (26) to mimic five basic emotions and used an open source emotion-in-voice detector to provide feedback on whether their acted emotion was recognized as intended. We found that it was difficult for participants to mimic all five emotions and that certain emotions were easier to mimic than others. However, it remains unclear whether this is due to the fact that emotion was only acted or due to the insufficiency of the detection software. As an intended side effect, we collected a small corpus of labeled data for acted emotion in speech, which we plan to extend and eventually use as training data for our own emotion detection.

The prototype presented these messages in VR and allowed to physically manipulate them, for example, by physically punching and trashing them. A qualitative empirical exploration (N=10) revealed a general positive shift in thoughts and emotions after using the prototype, mainly in form of increased relaxation and self-reflection. Based on this and further insights, we derive four themes for VR in mental health, touching upon the importance of personalization, immersion and focus, interaction design and embodiment, as well as, integration into everyday life.},

While previous research has studied player motivations and experiences for certain categories of digital games, there has yet to be such a study on digital board games, especially in the modern context of smartphone apps. To address this, we conduct a case study of a popular board game, Ludo, to understand players’ opinions of its digital adaptation. For this, we study the functionality and user reviews of nine popular Ludo apps, to assess player opinions of how traditional gameplay has been re-imagined. Based upon our analysis, we conclude with recommendations for improving Ludo apps and other apps, based on random chance board games.},

Our algorithm is an approach to solve the cold start recommendation problem in unknown places by mining available map-data. We implemented a prototypical smartphone app that generates and recommends pleasant running routes to evaluate our algorithm’s effectiveness. An in-the-wild user study was conducted, with 11 participants across three cities. We tested the correlation between what is defined as ”pleasant path” by our algorithm and the user’s perception. The results of the user study show a positive correlation and support our algorithm. We also outline implications for the design of successful recommendation algorithms for runners.},

	abstract     = {Activity recognition computer vision algorithms can be used to detect the presence of autism-related behaviors, including what are termed “restricted and repetitive behaviors”, or stimming, by diagnostic instruments. Examples of stimming include hand flapping, spinning, and head banging. One of the most significant bottlenecks for implementing such classifiers is the lack of sufficiently large training sets of human behavior specific to pediatric developmental delays. The data that do exist are usually recorded with a handheld camera which is itself shaky or even moving, posing a challenge for traditional feature representation approaches for activity detection which capture the camera's motion as a feature. To address these issues, we first document the advantages and limitations of current feature representation techniques for activity recognition when applied to head banging detection. We then propose a feature representation consisting exclusively of head pose keypoints. We create a computer vision classifier for detecting head banging in home videos using a time-distributed convolutional neural network (CNN) in which a single CNN extracts features from each frame in the input sequence, and these extracted features are fed as input to a long short-term memory (LSTM) network. On the binary task of predicting head banging and no head banging within videos from the Self Stimulatory Behaviour Dataset (SSBD), we reach a mean F1-score of 90.77% using 3-fold cross validation (with individual fold F1-scores of 83.3%, 89.0%, and 100.0%) when ensuring that no child who appeared in the train set was in the test set for all folds. This work documents a successful process for training a computer vision classifier which can detect a particular human motion pattern with few training examples and even when the camera recording the source clip is unstable. The process of engineering useful feature representations by visually inspecting the representations, as described here, can be a useful practice by designers and developers of interactive systems detecting human motion patterns for use in mobile and ubiquitous interactive systems.},

However, features obfuscating the location were considered superfluous, as participants preferred sharing their location exactly or not at all. While participants overall appreciated having the configuration options, changes in their partners’ configurations raised questions about their motivations. Instead, participants would adjust the configuration for different intimacy levels (colleague vs. partner) rather than different activities when using CLS with the same person.},

Nevertheless, few studies have directly investigated the specific role of different main contributors in such impairment in the same context. This study selected two of the main contributors leading to the impairment of human spatial memory and then made every possible effort to eliminate them from the navigation system: return user's route decision-making control, and subliminally return user's attention that has ever been distracted by the system to the environment. Two navigation modes were designed and compared in detail with the different spatial knowledge acquired by the efficient everyday navigation system. A within-subjects study in Virtual Reality (VR) urban environment was conducted and data on spatial knowledge was collected and analyzed. We concluded that the redirection of attention significantly benefits the acquisition of landmark as well as route knowledge, and the increase of route decisions further benefits survey knowledge as well as self-orientation. We also reflected on how these results might implicate future navigation systems design, and the results of analysis showed that it was possible to design a navigation system that does not impair or even enhance user's spatial memory while still retaining efficient navigation. Based on our findings, different future application-specific studies can better design navigation systems that focus on different spatial memories.},

At any time, users can enter the immersive 3D environment of each scene in the story by controlling an avatar. In this scene, users embrace a rich set of interactive possibilities, including in-depth exploration, conversations with characters, and gamified quests to guide the story. Users also have the option to watch their avatar explore the 3D environment automatically for a lean-back experience. User evaluation of our prototype confirmed the acceptance of this new model and enthusiasm for the interactive freedom and depth it provides. To the best of our knowledge, this is the world’s first lean-back-compatible TV model that offers a complete immersive experience driven by users, shedding light on a new direction for designing interactive videos appealing to a wide audience.},

In this work, we propose a VR system to view and manipulate medical 3D images of livers in combination with 3D printed liver models as controllers. We investigate whether users benefit from a controller in the shape of a liver and if the size matters by using three different sizes (50&nbsp;%, 75&nbsp;%, 100&nbsp;%). In a user study with 14 surgeons, we focused on presence, workload and qualitative feedback such as preference. While neither size differences nor the VIVE tracker as control resulted in significant differences, most surgeons preferred the 75&nbsp;% model. Qualitative results indicate that high similarity of physical and virtual objects regarding shape and a focus on good manageability of the physical object is more important than providing an exact replica in size.},

This paper reports experience with a recent 5-week VR conference with participants from academia and leading industry experts. Drawing on Activity Theory and Installation Theory, a structural grid for virtual conferencing activity analysis is described. We argue that for successful interactive virtual conferencing, the installation must facilitate both the development of knowledge and informal social interaction, the ‘epistemic’ and the ‘relational’. We focus on three specific aspects of the conference activity—onboarding, networking, and intersession transitions—to highlight key issues and illustrate the process of design thinking based on distributed architecture. We discuss lessons learned to inform this fast-growing field: provisions for meaningful social interactions remain underdeveloped in current conferencing systems.},

	abstract     = {The piano keyboard offers a significant range and polyphony for well-trained pianists. Yet, apart from dynamics, the piano is incapable of translating expressive movements such as vibrato onto the played note. Adding sound effects requires additional modalities. A pitch wheel can be found on the side of most electric pianos. To add a vibrato or pitch bend, the pianist needs to actively operate the pitch wheel with their hand, which requires cognitive effort and may disrupt play. In this work, we present EMPiano, a system that allows pianists to incorporate a soft pitch vibrato into their play seamlessly. Vibrato can be triggered through muscle activity and is recognized via electromyography. This allows EMPiano to integrate into piano play. Our system offers new interaction opportunities with the piano to increase the player’s potential for expressive play. In this paper, we contribute the open-source implementation and the workflow behind EMPiano.},

Its design allows it to fold back on top of the user's nail when not in use, keeping the user's fingerpad free to, for instance, manipulate handheld tools and other objects while in MR. To achieve this, we engineered a wireless and self-contained haptic device, which measures 24\texttimes{}24\texttimes{}41&nbsp;mm and weighs 9.5&nbsp;g. Furthermore, our foldable end-effector also features a linear resonant actuator, allowing it to render not only touch contacts (i.e., pressure) but also textures (i.e., vibrations).

Similarly, we found 286 of 402 relevant models in the kyub [1] model library to contain such flaws.

	abstract     = {Although technical systems may not seem on the surface to be philosophical in nature, there is a historical influence in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) of Heidegger via the work of Winograd and Dreyfus. However, the late philosopher Bernard Stiegler critiqued this positivist reading of Heidegger, noting how Heidegger himself ultimately did not understand the political stakes of technology. Rather than abandon technology, Bernard Stiegler argued that we must repurpose technology to create a new form of society in the wake of the digital disruption. We review his often difficult philosophical vocabulary, his political stance, and his nearly unknown role in motivating a number of innovative software projects at Institut de recherche et d’innovation du Centre Pompidou. It is precisely a fundamental philosophical reorientation that will allow researchers to create the new kinds of programs that can meet the challenge posed by our digital epoch.},

	abstract     = {In “Being a Beast”, Charles Foster recounts living with, and as, wildlife (e.g., otters, foxes). These encounters, he contends, forge human-nature connections which have waned, negatively impacting biodiversity conservation. Yet, we need not live amidst beasts to bridge the human-nature gap. Cross-reality (XR) platforms (i.e., virtual and augmented reality) have the unique capacity to facilitate pseudo interactions with, and as, wildlife, connecting audiences to the plight of endangered species. However, XR-based wildlife interaction, I argue, is a double-edged sword whose implementation warrants as much attention in HCI as in environmental science. In this paper I highlight the promise of XR-based wildlife encounters, and discuss dilemmas facing developers tasked with fabricating mediated interactions with wildlife. I critique this approach by outlining how such experiences may negatively affect humans and the survivability of the very species seeking to benefit from them.},

	abstract     = {A person's name embodies identity. During user studies in Human Computer Interaction (HCI), persons are often renamed (pseudonymization) to hide their identity for privacy and ethical reasons. Pseudonymization occurs mostly as a “silent” affair of due diligence. Researchers barely give substantial information to the process nor reveal a reflexive position nor acknowledge the underlying elements of power and identity negotiation. As HCI advances in mitigating the design of biased technologies and breaking oppressive structures, I argue, in this paper, the need for the field to re-consider research requirements such as pseudonymization as possible to embody oppressive structures and erase identity. I present a review of papers from the 2020 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI ‘20) that illustrate how silent the HCI approach is. My argument is built on Critical Race Theory, questioning the objectivity of such technical requirements. I use personal narratives to bolster this argument, ending with a call to the HCI community to acknowledge the power and privilege in renaming participants with three recommendations for consideration.},

We designed stories and interactions using both plot-based narrative frameworks and character-based machine-learning-generated dialogues for effecting cooperation. We then ran a series of workshops investigating how designers negotiate and collaborate to tell stories for social purpose using a "finish each other's stories" approach.

A compelling amount of evidence shows that the majority of consumers does not feel comfortable with being tracked or profiled. This paper analyses how this vision may be realised through a variety of projects and case examples. The conclusion is that technology without tracking, personal data collection, or personal data analysis, may gradually emerge as the dominant mode of innovation and computing over the next 30 years.},

Virtual Reality (VR) is a representative example of this type of technology.

It was also suggested that VR can complement prosthesis training, by improving the functionality of the missing body part. Finally, it was shown that VR can resolve one of the most common challenges for a new prosthesis user, which is to accept the fitting of the prosthetic device to their own body.},

The participants had to review summaries generated by the DL model with two different types of text highlights and with no highlights at all. The study found that participants were significantly faster in completing the task with highlights based on attention scores from the DL model, but not with highlights based on a source attribution method, a model-agnostic formula that compares the source text and summary to identify overlapping language. The participants also reported increased trust in the DL model and expressed a preference for the attention highlights over the other type of highlights. This is because the attention highlights had more use cases, for example, the participants were able to use them to enrich the machine-generated summary. The findings of this study provide insights into the benefits and the challenges of selecting suitable mechanisms to provide explainability for DL models in the summarization task.},

We focus on understanding users’ perception of robot behaviours and interactions within the context of a public space. In our exploratory study using a novel participatory design methodology, participants designed robot behaviours for applications in public spaces, and tested their design both in a simulator and on the physical robot. We investigate how participants’ perception and expectations change during this iterative participatory prototyping process, especially when the robot exhibits erratic or unexpected behaviours. Our work provides insights on users’ perception of robot failures, and how users’ design of robot behaviours shifts as they observe the robot within the spatial and social context.},

	abstract     = {We present a new device designed for field studies which have the goal of assessing the perception of overcrowding in nature experiences, with a special focus on areas subjected to mass tourism (pre COVID-19). The design of the device resulted from an interdisciplinary approach attempting to mix valuable techniques from User Experience exploratory research, with the typical way of conducting overcrowding investigations in outdoors and wild areas. We began by reframing both nature and overcrowding as experiences and defining overcrowding as a disturbance to the nature experience. This lead to a new idea for a more beneficial investigation of visitor’s perception, which is moment-to-moment and in context. The device supports recording someone’s subjective perception of overcrowding in space and time, with minimal task load or distraction from the nature experience. The streamlined design affords only two buttons with competing functionalities: one to signal “there are too many people at the park” and another for “the park is too empty”. The device continuously records time, location, and press-down button events, storing everything locally and anonymously, within the boundaries of European GDPR. We applied our method to a field study at the \TH{}ingvellir National Park in Iceland, both a protected area and a UNESCO World Heritage. We then analyzed the collected data and visualized where and when the visitors reported overcrowding. Initial results indicate that by complementing traditional questionnaires with moment-to-moment self-reporting, we could successfully estimate the disturbance from overcrowding over time and place, thus producing a deeper insight into the quality of the experience than questionnaires alone. Our results also speak of some intrinsic qualities of the outdoor infrastructure. The outcome has the potential to make park managers, designers, landscape architects and rangers more capable of understanding the complex interrelation between infrastructure and visitor flow, thus contributing towards the goals of a long-term sustainable management of the area.},

In this case study, we outline a design research agenda that emerged from the practical needs of an open source community focused on digital health software for community health in low- and middle-income countries. We situate this case study in the global landscape of data regulations, and the call for responsible data practices that go above and beyond regulatory compliance. We share findings from the formative stages of our multi-stage design process, which include a scoping literature review and a reframing of institutional policies and procedures. A primary contribution of our case study is that it offers an example of the institutional ‘pre-work’ necessary to make sense of the complex data protection landscape, and to chart a path forward for designing software that better supports responsible data practices.

The typical user-centered design workflow requires the developers and users to go through many iterations of design, implementation, and analysis. The procedure is inefficient, and human decisions highly bias the results. While computational methods are used to assist various design tasks, there has not been any holistic approach to automate the design of input components. My thesis proposed a series of Computational Input Design workflows: I envision a sample-efficient multi-objective optimization algorithm that cleverly selects design instances, which are instantly deployed on physical simulators. A meta-reinforcement learning user model then simulates the user behaviors when using the design instance upon the simulators. The new workflows derive Pareto-optimal designs with high efficiency and automation. I demonstrate designing a push-button via the proposed methods. The resulting designs outperform the known baselines. The Computational Input Design process can be generalized to other devices, such as joystick, touchscreen, mouse, controller, etc.},

	abstract     = {While the accuracy of Natural Language Processing (NLP) models has been going up, users have more expectations than captured by just accuracy. Despite practitioners’ attempt to inspect model blind spots or lacking capabilities, the status-quo processes can be ad-hoc and biased. My thesis focuses on helping practitioners organize and explore the inputs and outputs of their models, such that they can gain more systematic insights into their models’ behaviors. I identified two building blocks that are essential for informative analysis: (1) to scale up the analysis by grouping similar instances, and (2) to isolate important components by generating counterfactuals. To support multiple analysis stages (training data assessment, error analysis, model testing), I designed various interactive tools that instantiate these two building blocks. In the process, I characterized the design space of grouping and counterfactual generation, seeking to balance the machine powers and practitioners’ domain expertise. My future work proposes to explore how the grouping and counterfactual techniques can benefit non-experts in the data collection process.},

	abstract     = {Space travel and becoming an interplanetary species have always been part of human’s greatest imagination. Research in space exploration helps us advance our knowledge in fundamental sciences, and challenges us to design new technology and create new industries for space. However, keeping a human healthy, happy and productive in space is one of the most challenging aspects of current space programs. Our biological body, which evolved in the earth specific environment, can barely survive by itself in space’s extreme conditions with high radiation, low gravity, etc. This is similar for the moons and planets in the solar system that humans plan to visit. Therefore, researchers have been developing different types of human-computer interfaces systems that support humans’ physical and mental performance in space. With recent advancements in aerospace engineering, and the democratized access to space through aerospace tech startups such as SpaceX, Blue Origin, etc., space research is becoming more plausible and accessible. Thus, there is an exciting opportunity for researchers in HCI to contribute to the great endeavor of space exploration by designing new types of interactive systems and computer interfaces that can support humans living and working in space and elsewhere in the solar system.},

We will achieve this through sharing of research experiences, and exploration of challenges encountered when planning HCI4D studies featuring participants with disabilities.

We will explore how interactive systems enhance sports experience without distracting from the actual goal of the athlete, such as freeing the mind.

System Development Life Cycle which is SDLC have been implemented based on the main five phases. Standard System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) was implemented, including the analysis, design, development, testing and evaluation phases to ensure that the game suits the requirement of the targeted users. The project was conducted in three phases - Preliminary Test, Pilot Test and Final Test. 90% among the users of mixed ability were able to play this game and interacted through gestures such as touching and swiping screen of the mobile device. 75% of the users demonstrated that they could play game without depending on visual cues, i.e. only depending on bidirectional sounds (audio cues).

Finally, the participants also developed a healthy and organized habit of self-reflection and even reflected on their holistic well-being and the meaning of having a ‘good day’.

Validation with 25 senior high school students who used Abot for a one-week period showed a positive improvement in their physical well-being, positive change in their social well-being, and positive change in their academic well-being. Students’ evaluation of Abot on a 4-point Likert scale showed an average score of 3.35 on performance, 3.36 on humanity, and 3.68 on affect, which points to perceived user acceptability of the chatbot as a potential tool to help them manage their health and well-being.},

We present an initial evaluation through a field study (n=56) over 6 weeks and a controlled experiment (n=22). The result indicates insights on how learners build a sense of belonging and develop peer interactions leading to close-knit learning circles. We find that PeerCollab can provide more meaningful interactions and create a community to bring a culture of social learning to decentralized, and isolated MOOC learners.},

We facilitated an elicitation study to identify natural and user-defined gestures for interactions with facial expressions. Different gestures can be further discerned via face detection and a classification pipeline. We designed a sketching demonstration application to explore usage scenarios and evaluated the effectiveness of FacialPen through a qualitative study.

	abstract     = {Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) often lack valuable social presences that provide learners opportunities to interact and to be feel as a real person. This subjective experience of being present with a “real” person and having access to their thoughts and emotions increase the learning experience. Although MOOCs provide forums for such interactions, they are often populated with cognitive types of presence limiting social presence. Meaningful social interactions are challenging in MOOCs due to scale and design limitations. This research presents a conceptual framework of 4 phases: Cluster, Orient, Focus and Network to scaffold better social interaction in MOOCs. The framework introduce a re-design of interactions in MOOC forums space — leverages clustered groups by creating many communities in forums spaces with a community leader facilitating the conversations leading social presence. It also provides a community structure with orientation, focus to work in the community and better networking opportunities. An initial integration of the framework to a real MOOC with 27,554 students provides preliminary results indicating effective scaffolding of social presence in MOOC communities, yet the framework poses challenges relying the social interactions centered upon community manger. However, the study opens new directions to leverage communities in MOOCs and potential to scale.},

	abstract     = {Nowadays, smartphones have become an inseparable part of students’ life. Many previous studies have explored smartphone usage behavior in different contexts. However, to our best knowledge, smartphone usage behavior of the high and low academic result holders is very less studied. Thus, in the context of Bangladesh, using 7 days’ actual smartphone usage data of high [N=32] and low [N=44] performers, we investigate the smartphone usage of these two groups. Our findings show that low performers are more focused on certain apps of the Launcher category whereas high performers are more focused on certain apps of the Video category. Moreover, we find that low performers’ micro usage and review session number is statistically significantly (p&lt;0.05) higher. Based on different smartphone usage data, our presented machine learning model classifies these two groups of students with 73.33% accuracy. Thus, these findings suggest that high and low performers can be identified through smartphone usage data.},

However, existing emergency alerts messaging systems provide redundant precautions. Also, the National Emergency Alert (NEA) messages are sent through the base transceiver station, the area where the actual COVID-19 confirmed case occurred and the area where the message was received do not match. In this paper, we present CO-ALERT, a tool that effectively provides older adults aged 50 or older with NEA messages. We developed CO-ALERT through a design thinking process to suggest solutions that effectively address the needs of potential target users.

A real object surface touched a hand is recognized using the position and posture of the hand acquired by a hand-tracking sensor on a head-mounted display; a virtual keyboard is placed on that surface to provide haptic feedback. We performed a pilot study to compare text entry performance when the virtual keyboard was placed in mid-air, on a wall, on a desk, and on the user’s thighs.

Although there is little problem to conduct one-on-one remote conferences, remote group discussion still contains many challenges. One of the main issue is that the remote participants often unnotice the referential action performed by the local participants. To solve such problem, we proposed to develop a function that automatically detects the presence of referential action and displays to the remote participant. One of the issues for this function is about what kind of information of the referential action should be provided and how the information should be displayed. In this research, we conducted a lab study to compare two displaying methods: Picture-in-Picture (PiP) and auto-pilot and compare two displaying contents: object being referred and person performing the referential action. The result shows that the PiP method had higher usability and remote participant had higher opportunity to join the conversation with the PiP method. On the other hand, displaying object being referred had higher usability than displaying the person performing the referential action.},

While prior work has assessed these tools qualitatively, it is still unclear how to quantitatively evaluate reference managers. This paper starts to quantify the user effort required to use reference managers. We first collected surveys from 69 graduate students to understand their experience with reference managers, and then conducted user studies with 12 participants. In our study, each participant was asked to perform a standardized task using four popular reference managers: Mendeley, Zotero, EndNote, and RefWorks. We used RUI, a keystroke and mouse-move logger, to record the participants’ activities and approximate their physical and mental effort. We also used pre- and post-study surveys to collect users’ feedback and self-reported task load (as expressed by the NASA TLX Index.) The results showed that different reference managers require different levels of effort, and users generally prefer the tools that involve less effort. We also found that although reference managers share similar features, differences in presentation and organization matter. We conclude this work by providing a set of guidelines for both users and developers of reference managers.},

In this paper, we compared two existing conversational storytelling agents, Orsen and EREN, by analyzing the dialog logs to examine children’s engagement when sharing their stories with these agents. Taking three dimensions - language production, flow maintenance, and affect; into consideration, results show that the ability of EREN to recognize emotions expressed in the child’s input text can encourage the children to be more open to sharing their stories. Even though the agent cannot generate affect-rich responses, its ability to recognize the emotions made children feel thankful and appreciative of the agent for listening.},

Common touchscreen interaction of these applications is unnatural as it loses certain physical aspects such as movement, size, and effort. A preliminary study was conducted to find out how users would interact with gamelan mobile applications, as playing on the real instrument and on the applications are different. Results showed that even with the touchscreen interaction, users played on the applications using different combinations of hands and fingers. Factors on users’ familiarity with the playing techniques of the real instrument and the physical aspects of how the instruments are played influenced their interactions on the applications. Findings from this study gave us more information on underlying criteria to design gamelan mobile applications with more natural and expressive features.},

Second, site blockers, self-trackers, and timers are commonly used, but they are ineffective as they are easy-to-ignore and not personalized. Third, away-from-computer breaks, especially involving physical activity, are helpful, whereas on-screen breaks are unhelpful, especially when they are long, because they are not refreshing.

	abstract     = {The pandemic in 2020 and the resultant global lockdown led to new dynamics in the homestead. Families faced an accelerated process of digitization of conventional processes like education and white collar jobs. Working women with children of school or kindergarten age were forced to redraw the boundaries between the personal and the professional as the entire family essentially functioned from home, which increased prevalent gender inequalities. Tasks like 'planning', care-giving, emotional care etc. go unaccounted for and remain invisible to other members of the household. We present a feminist design research project that explores how design research can contribute to greater social justice and gender equality by a fairer distribution of domestic labour. We conducted semi-structured interviews in India during the pandemic lockdown, to elicit both explicit as well as tacit information on daily workloads of working women with families. We found disparity in domestic duties between genders, with specific regard to the circumstances created by the 2020 pandemic conditions. Based on our findings and analysis, we prototyped a visualization tool that makes invisible domestic work visible. Our research contribution is a design research methodology to generate insights to enable creation of design interventions for social justice. This was achieved through use of established design research methods, that are conventionally used in face-to-face settings, which were then adapted to exceptional pandemic conditions that required social distancing where communication was remote, and usually virtual.},

To develop an system that PwD wants to use on a daily basis, we conducted a co-production practice with PwD focussing on outing their home. We collaborate with a group of early-onset dementia who wanted their opinions to be reflected in ICT. A participatory design workshop was undertaken to discuss the development of outing assistants. As a result, it was found that they did not want the system to be responsible for intervening in their disabilities, but to positively encourage their activities. To conduct a case study for outing assists, we focused on a person with dementia’s activity to verify whether it contributes to her life. The system was implemented as a voice and visual interaction system, designed to encourage a positive relationship between the supporter and her. Our results indicate that the system design to support PwD should produce positive interaction and should be adapted to the individual context.},

Interactions and collaborated learning remain as vital weaknesses. In this paper, we are interested in improving MOOC interactions by investigating learners’ experience with current popular MOOC platforms starting with a survey. We also conducted a task analysis on three popular MOOC platforms, Coursera, LinkedIn Learning, and Canvas, to analyze whether and how they include key interaction functions. We found that learner-instructor and teamwork interaction affect users’ experience most. Based on our findings, we propose a set of comprehensive guidelines, called IN-MOOC, to facilitate interpersonal interactions on MOOC platforms. In summary, IN-MOOC provides comprehensive and hierarchical guidelines to improve users’ experience via enhancing interpersonal interaction on MOOC platforms.},

There are 80+ types of autoimmune diseases. Some autoimmune diseases are life-threatening, and most are debilitating and require a lifetime of treatment. The variability in the development of daily symptoms and the condition of the patients with autoimmune disease increases the need for PHR. Thymun is a mobile application made for people with autoimmune disease and contains PHR as its main feature. In this study, we do a usability evaluation in the previous iteration and also gather the needs and problems that patients have with their traditional way of monitoring their health. After the founded usability problems and new found needs we then redesign the product in the 2nd iteration and then conduct usability evaluation. It was found that the feature with the smallest usability score is symptoms recording. The results of the interview after the test obtained qualitative information about the problems experienced by participants when undergoing the test and the participants’ perceptions as users of the application design when using the prototype. Finally, a post-test survey was carried out using the SUS test instrument, which obtained a usability score of 74.

We explored how this system can be used to simulate the behavior of a computer vision model. We tested WoE with design students to determine the importance of considering ML errors in design, the relevance of using descriptive error types instead of confusion matrix, and the suitability of manual error control in WoZ studies.

	abstract     = {Various tools and approaches are available to support undergraduate students learning to program. Most of them concentrate on the code and aim to ease the visualization of data structures or guide the debugging. However, in undergraduate introductory courses, students are typically given exercises in the form of a natural language problem. Deriving a correct solution largely depends on the problem-solving strategy they adopt rather than on their proficiency in dealing with the syntax and semantics of the code. Indeed, they face various challenges (apart from the coding), such as identifying the relevant information, stating the algorithmic steps to solve it, breaking it into smaller parts, and evaluating the implemented solution. To our knowledge, almost no attention has been paid to supporting such problem-solving strategies before and during the coding. This paper reports an interview and a sketching exercise with 10 participants exploring how the novices approach the programming exercises from a problem-solving perspective and how they imagine a tool to support their cognitive process. Findings show that students intuitively perform various actions over the exercise text, and they would appreciate having support from the development environment. Accordingly, based on these findings, we provide implications for designing tools to support problem-solving strategies.},

We present StickyLand, a notebook extension for empowering users to freely organize their code in non-linear ways. With sticky cells that are always shown on the screen, users can quickly access their notes, instantly observe experiment results, and easily build interactive dashboards that support complex visual analytics. Case studies highlight how our tool can enhance notebook users’s productivity and identify opportunities for future notebook designs.

To address this gap, we ran five online co-design workshops with 44 teenagers (aged 13-18 years) in the United Kingdom to design a self-tracking guide for teens. We focused on content, presentation of information, and distribution strategy. Our findings highlight the complexity of creating resources which adeptly capture the needs of this diverse user group. To successfully build interactive educational resources appropriate for teens’ positive engagement with health-related self-tracking tools, designers and researchers must prioritize teen-centered design with a focus on: (1) teens’ core reasons for self-tracking and (2) opportunities for social support and community-building.},

Our solution draws from acupuncture's global use in treating addiction and recent evidence that non-invasive TEAS can reduce the urge to smoke after exposure to a drug-related cue. Specifically, we have designed a device formed to four acupoints (LI4, PC8, PC6, and TH5) located on the wrist and hand, and programmed to deliver 5-15mA stimulation. Through a paired mobile application, individuals are simultaneously guided through an MBRP intervention to help them take control of their response to the trigger. Together, this system provides real-time relief from the urge to smoke so individuals can better engage with cognitive behavioral relapse prevention strategies in high risk moments.},

	abstract     = {For non-sport fans, perceiving the excitement of surrounding fan groups and the arousal of collective emotions are some of the crucial factors that motivate their engaged excitement and loyalty in a sport; these factors are closely related to the process of evolution from a non-fan to a fan. The global COVID-19 pandemic changed the way of sport-watching from watching at the arena to watching from home alone. This has highlighted significant difficulties in the excitement transmission and arousal channel between non-sport fans and fans. Previous remote emotional intervening mediums had been limited to the use of virtual avatars to convey partners’ external cues (such as appearance), to enhance the sense of presence from visual-audio perspectives. In this study, we explored a novel remote emotional intervening medium that conveys sport-fans’ internal cues (bio-signals) that are widely believed to be related to internal emotional states of human, and displays those signals in a way that gives non-sport fans a deeper and more immersive experience: haptic feedback experience. Three bio-signal-based haptic feedback prototypes were developed, including heart-rate-based vibration, electromyography (EMG)-based pressure, and skin-temperature-based thermal feedbacks. An exploratory pilot study was conducted on a group of non-sport fans in a lab-control environment of remote-sport-watching to explore the effectiveness of the proposed mediums in enhancing their perception of sport-fan’s excitement (emotion perception). Besides, we also analyzed non-sport fans’ heart rate data when they were participants in the experiments to measure the performance of the proposed mediums in evoking the engaged excitement of non-sport fans (emotion arousal). Our results indicate the outstanding ability of EMG-based pressure feedback in effectively enhancing the process of emotion perception and the notable advantage of heart-rate-based vibration feedback in the arousal of non-sport fans’ engaged excitement. This study presents the potential utility of bio-signal-based haptic feedback in augmenting remote emotional perception and arousal and also provides the underlining support for the future exploration and development directions for social computing based on bio-signals and haptic technologies.},

We present an empirical study on user perception of adopting two-factor authentication (n=465). Our findings indicate that, due to the time sensitive nature of many tasks that required MFA, university students are likely to experience strong negative emotions towards MFA that drastically lower their perceptions of its utility and usability. However, our findings also show that these negative emotions can be at least partially mitigated when users feel more personally secure due to MFA, which can in part be controlled by rollout strategy and communication.},

However the player has not been given the possibility to explore and play with one’s emotions as an active feature. Given the high subjectivity of felt emotions we wanted to focus on the player’s experience of emotional input rather than the objective accuracy of the input sensor. We therefore implemented a proof-of-concept game using heart-rate as a proxy for emotion measurement and through repeated player tests the game mechanics were revised and evaluated. Valuable insight for the design of entertainment-focused emotional input games were gained, including emotional connection despite limited accuracy, influence of the environment and the importance of calibration. The players overall enjoyed the novel game experience and their feedback carries useful implications for future games including active emotional input.},

We tested the application in a usability study (n = 25) where we observed participants using the application. Most participants affirmed that this application would help them feel more grateful. Participants also had an overall positive response to the AR experience for expressing gratitude and suggested novel and unexpected uses for the application as well as potential for misuse. We believe this study demonstrates the potential of using AR technology in new ways to positively influence the human-centered design space of gratitude.},

Similarly, significant progress has been made with more traditional optimization- and planning-based approaches to accommodate the need for adapting UIs for screens with different sizes, orientations and aspect ratios, and in emerging domains such as VR/AR and 3D interfaces. The proposed workshop seeks to bring together researchers interested in all kinds of computational approaches for user interfaces across different sectors as a community, including those who develop algorithms and models and those who build applications, to discuss common issues including the need for resources, opportunities for new applications, design implications for human-AI interaction in this domain, and practical challenges such as user privacy.},

I will conduct qualitative interviews to understand players’ ideal relationships with games, and quantitative experiments to investigate the impact of built-in interventions on such relationships.

In the post-COVID 19 world, sociotechnical uncertainties and unforeseen challenges to learning in hybrid learning environments constitute a unique frontier where robotic and immersive technologies can mediate learning experiences. The aim of this workshop is to set the stage for a new wave of HCI research that accounts for and begins to develop new insights, concepts, and methods for use of immersive and telerobotic technologies in real-world learning environments.

This workshop explores how a reimagined perspective on crowdsourcing platforms could provide a more equitable, fair, and rewarding experience. This includes not only the workers but also the platforms, who could benefit e.g. from better processes for worker onboarding, skills-development, and growth. We invite visionary takes in various formats on this topic to spread awareness of worker-centric research and developments to the CHI community. As a result of interactive ideation work in the workshop, we articulate a future direction roadmap for research centred around crowdsourcing platforms. Finally, as a specific interest area, the workshop seeks to study crowdwork from the context of the Global South, which has been arising as an important but critically understudied crowdsourcing market in recent years.},

	abstract     = {The spreadsheet is one of the most popular general user interfaces. Table manipulation, such as cell insertion and removal, is usually performed by selecting a menu command or using shortcut keys. However, the enormous number of shortcut keys makes them difficult to learn and remember. We sought to design a mid-air hand gesture-based interface for table manipulation in spreadsheet applications. As hand gestures and table manipulations are both spatial in nature, there should be a natural mapping between them. In this paper, we performed two user studies to derive a user-defined gesture set allowing 13 types of table manipulation. In the first study, we collected mid-air hand gestures devised by participants for manipulations implemented in existing spreadsheet software. In the second study, we asked other participants to vote for their most preferred gestures. We analyzed the characteristics of the collected gestures and votes, and created a final user-defined gesture set.},

	abstract     = {The first step toward accessibility improvement in the context of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is the identification of potential barriers. A recent study shows that words that are frequently copied to the clipboard by web users are relatively complex. A plausible reason is that users copy challenging words to search for a translation or more information. Accordingly, tracking word-copying operations of web users may be useful in identifying complex words. This study focuses on the users that apply word-copying. It shows significant differences in the frequency of word-copying operations among different populations of users. On the examined website, whose content is in English, users whose preferred language is not English copied single words to the clipboard significantly more frequently than users whose preferred language is English. Further analysis of the data also shows that word-copying was more frequent among users whose preferred languages have low proximity to English, such as Asian languages, compared to Western European languages. These results support the observation that word-copying indicates complexity, as it is reasonable to expect that native speakers of foreign languages (and especially of languages that are considerably different from the website’s language) are more likely to need help with complex words. Word complexity is subjective and audience-dependent. This study contributes to the understanding of which users tend to use word-copying, and accordingly, in which context word-copying data can be used as a word complexity indicator. It also introduces a new practical approach for detecting language barriers in order to improve language accessibility on global websites.},

Several reachability techniques have been developed to enable users to access such areas, but many of these techniques are designed to enable users to perform only a tap gesture, so other single-touch gestures such as long-tap, double-tap, swipe, and drag cannot be performed. To enable all single-touch gestures for unreachable areas, we designed a hover-based reachability technique that uses a cursor. In addition, we conducted a pilot study to compare user performance with our technique and that of existing techniques, One-Handed Mode (OM) and Event Forward Cursor (EC). The results showed that our technique was faster than EC, which uses the same cursor technique as ours, except for the double-tap gesture when the target was small. However, our technique was slower than OM, which is the technique that shrinks the entire screen. Lastly, we discuss possible improvements of our technique on the basis of the results.},

While significant research focus has aimed to measure and promote trust in human-AI interaction, the field lacks synthesized definitions and understanding of results across contexts. Indeed, conceptualizing trust and reliance, and identifying the best ways to measure these constructs and effectively shape them in human-AI interactions remains a challenge. This workshop aims to establish building appropriate trust and reliance on (imperfect) AI systems as a vital, yet under-explored research problem. The workshop will provide a venue for exploring three broad aspects related to human-AI trust: (1) How do we clarify definitions and frameworks relevant to human-AI trust and reliance (e.g., what does trust mean in different contexts)? (2) How do we measure trust and reliance? And, (3) How do we shape trust and reliance? As these problems and solutions involving humans and AI are interdisciplinary in nature, we invite participants with expertise in HCI, AI, ML, psychology, and social science, or other relevant fields to foster closer communications and collaboration between multiple communities.},

This case study documents the experiences of a collaboration between social and computer scientists focused on using a novel programming-by-demonstration tool for web automation, Helena, to inform rental housing policy and inequalities in the United States. While this project was initially focused on collecting housing ads from a single site within the Seattle area, the capacity to scale our project to new sources and locations afforded by Helena’s human-centered design allowed a team of social scientists to progress to scraping data across the country and multiple platforms. Using this project as a case study, we discuss a.) important programming and research challenges that were encountered and b.) how Helena’s design helped us overcome these barriers to using scraped web data in basic research and policy analysis.},

The purpose is to identify the phases in the AI feature journey for enterprise users across their spectrum of experiences, perceptions, and technical acumen. This paper presents this journey of enterprise users working with AI features, analyzes existing challenges and opportunities within this journey, and proposes recommendations to address these areas when planning, designing, and developing AI features for business applications.},

	abstract     = {Accessibility in a hospital is challenging for people in low-income countries due to a lack of accessible mediums to communicate wayfinding, accessibility, and healthcare information. This results in delays and stress but can also result in sub-optimal treatment or sometimes a complete lack of treatment for the visitors. Sensible physical and digital interventions can greatly ease the experience of visitors and reduce the work-related stress of healthcare providers. We present a case study on wayfinding and service design for a mega ophthalmic care facility that has a daily footfall of 2500 patients. From our mixed-methods study we identified: (i) there are very few accessible mediums available to communicate wayfinding, accessibility, and healthcare information; (ii) there is a lack of inclusively designed interventions to accommodate the diversity of visitors; (iii) spatial ambiguity and situational impairment due to crowd density exasperate the situation and (iv) there exist missing as well as misleading information. We developed a spectrum of solutions on the environmental and digital infrastructures available within this context to deliver wayfinding and procedural information. We completed a progressive intervention across digital and physical mediums over a duration of 18 months. This has shown the impact of each medium on visitors’ experience. We found the choice of interface to access information depends on the ease of access, and ease of access depends on visitors’ abilities. Therefore, both the environment and digital mediums are found to be useful for visitors. Based on these empirical findings, we draw recommendations for an inclusive service design that incorporates using elements of the environment, human and digital infrastructure to support a more positive healthcare visitors experience.},

The research is motivated by the high failure rates and low involvement of consumers in the food startup industry’s product design process. To help food startups design products in a more consumer-friendly and timely manner, we are developing a novel framework called the Food Personality Framework (FPF). This framework categorizes eaters according to their eating habits, preferences, motivations and constraints. To better understand the complex relationships between motivations, we chose Grounded Theory as the most pertinent approach and interviewed 14 singles with full autonomy over their food choices. We further leveraged the availability of large online food-related datasets to inform and reinforce our findings from the qualitative work. We analyzed 6687 user behaviors of Food.com, a popular recipe recommendation site, according to the 18 influencers of food choice identified from the qualitative interviews. We found three meaningful clusters of user behavior: Minimalists, Social Butterflies and Conscious eaters. The interview data, thus, enabled grounded classification of the large scale user behavior and provided a grounded way to interpret the relationship among the top motivators identified in each clusters. The cluster analysis will inform future sampling of interviewees and will provide new insightful questions for the qualitative research. The case study delineates a dynamic interplay of qualitative and quantitative data used to investigate human food choice, a novel domain in the Human-Food Interaction literature.},

Through group discussion and collaborative speculation we will address questions such as: What are the relationships between digital technology and human emotion? What roles does emotion play in HCI research? How should HCI researchers conceptualize emotion? When should HCI researchers use interdisciplinary theories of emotion or create new theory? Can specific emotions be designed for, and where is this knowledge likely to be applied? What are the implications of emotion research for design, ethics and wellbeing? What is the future of emotion in human-computer interaction?},

This workshop will explicitly address the challenges of designing interactive aquatic systems with the aim of articulating the grand challenges faced by WaterHCI. We will first map user experiences around water based on participants’ personal experiences with water and interactive technology. Building on those experiences, we then discuss specific challenges when designing interactive aquatic experiences.

Using a hands-on design sprint technique, participants will (1) map out different complex care ecosystems, (2) generate ideas for technologies, services, and other multi-faceted interventions to address gaps in those ecosystems, and (3) choose the most promising ideas to further develop and refine. We will close by reflecting together on what we have created, our approaches to design, and the theories and concepts that shaped our approaches.

Training is an inherently collaborative effort, with trainees and trainers working together to achieve specific goals. Recently, we have seen considerable effort to use virtual training environments (VTEs) in many demanding training contexts, e.g. police training, medical first responder training, firefighter training etc. For such contexts, trainers and trainees must undertake various roles as supervisors, adaptors, role players, and observers in training, making collaboration complex, but essential for training success. These social and multi-user aspects for collaborative VTEs have received little investigation so far. Therefore, we propose this workshop to discuss the potential and perspectives of VTEs for challenging training settings. In a one-day online workshop, researchers and practitioners will jointly develop a research agenda on how currently underrepresented aspects of social and collaborative work can be integrated into VR-supported training. This workshop will focus on two themes: (1) Multi-sensory experience: novel collaborative interfaces for VTEs (e.g. joint use of tangible devices, strategies for preventing simulator-induced negative effects); (2) Multi-user interaction: collaboration in VTEs between trainers (two trainers run a scenarios jointly), trainers and trainees /the trainer controls the scenario for a trainee), and trainees with each other (e.g. two trainees solve an exercise together)},

Though commercial CUI developments continue to rapidly advance, our scholarly dialogue on ethics of CUIs is underwhelming. The CUI community has implicitly been concerned with ethics, yet making it central to the growing body of work thus far has not been adequately done. Since ethics is a far-reaching topic, perspectives from philosophy, design, and engineering domains are integral to our CUI research community. For instance, philosophical traditions, e.g., deontology or virtue ethics, can guide ethical concepts that are relevant for CUIs, e.g., autonomy or trust. The practice of design through approaches like value sensitive design can inform how CUIs should be developed. Ethics comes into play with technical contributions, e.g., privacy-preserving data sharing between conversational systems. By considering such multidisciplinary angles, we come to a special topic of interest that ties together philosophy, design, and engineering: conversational disclosure, e.g., sharing personal information, transparency, e.g., as how to transparently convey relevant information in a conversational manner, and vulnerability of diverse user groups that should be taken into consideration.},

In addition, there existed a scaffolding gap between projects involving lights, batteries, and thread – and those requiring programming (i.e. leveraging the LilyPad Arduino and/or additional sensors or outputs). In an effort to expand access to electronic textiles, we designed the LilyTiny, an inexpensive, pre-programmed sewable microcontroller which controls assorted LED patterns, and which later became available for purchase through SparkFun. Alongside the LilyTiny, we released a free workshop guide for educators which details five low-cost activities that can be taught without any prior electronics experience. This paper summarizes our development of the LilyTiny and companion curriculum – and reflects on whether we met our stated goal of expanding access to electronic textiles in the decade since. We share and discuss some measures of impact, including a survey of derivative products and a multi-year analysis of sales data from the LilyTiny’s sole distributor SparkFun Electronics.},

We acknowledge an amplification of this trend through recent technological developments that aim toward human-computer integration, and explore the dark patterns that may arise for integrating emotions with machinic processes through “machine_in_the_middle”. Machine_in_the_middle is an interactive system in which a participant wears an electroencephalographic headset, and their neural activity is analysed to ascertain an approximation of their emotional state. Using electrical muscle stimulation their face is animated into an expression that corresponds with the output of the emotional recognition system. Through our work, we contribute the insight of three possible dark patterns that might emerge from emotional integration, including: reductionism of human emotion, disruptions of agency, and parasitic symbiosis. We hope that these insights inspire researchers and practitioners to approach human-computer integration more cautiously.},

	abstract     = {Collecting accurate and fine-grain information about the music people like, dislike and actually listen to has long been a challenge for sociologists. As millions of people now use online music streaming services, research can build upon the individual listening history data that are collected by these platforms. Individual interviews, in particular, can benefit from such data, by allowing the interviewers to immerse themselves in the musical universe of consenting respondents, and thus ask them contextualized questions and get more precise answers. Designing a visual exploration tool allowing such an immersion is however difficult, because of the volume and heterogeneity of the listening data, the unequal “visual literacy” of the prospective users, or the interviewers’ potential lack of knowledge of the music listened to by the respondents. In this case study we discuss the design and evaluation of such a tool. Designed with social scientists, its purpose is to help them in preparing and conducting semi-structured interviews that address various aspects of the listening experience. It was evaluated during thirty interviews with consenting users of a streaming platform in France.},

Researchers have identified auto-personalized interfaces, and more recently, Artificial Intelligence or AI-driven personalization as a potential solution to making commercial technology accessible in a scalable manner for users with fluctuating ability. However, there is a lack of understanding on the perceptions of people with dementia around AI as an aid to their everyday technology use and its role in their overall self-management systems, which include other non-AI technology, and human assistance.

	abstract     = {This paper presents Pneumatic Auxetics, an inverse optimization method for designing and fabricating morphing three-dimensional shapes out of patterns laid out flat. In origami/kirigami research, optimization of patterns that can be transformed into the target surface by inverse design has been attempted. On the other hand, in the research area of pneumatically actuated geometries, the control of the transformation using skeletons and membranes has been attempted. In the study of the inverse design of the auxetic pattern based on kirigami, it cannot actuate deformation by removing air because the design does not consider the thickness. Therefore, we simulate the pneumatic transition with the thick shell structure that is generated by offsetting the input surface (Figure 1). The designed skeleton is optimized for FGF (Fused Granular Fabrication) 3D printing, and it is 3D printed using soft elastomeric materials. These allow for both a deformable hinge and a rigid pattern. Thus, a skeleton made of a single material can be deformed to approximate the shape of the target-input surface by placing it in a membrane and removing the air. In this paper, we introduce related works and research contexts, challenges, inverse design simulator and its fabrication by 3D printing, and potential future applications.},

Our more open-ended approach to computer-augmented reflection explores new tangible mediums and methods to facilitate a sense of playful fluidity in machine interactions. A deep learning pipeline is developed that finds meaning within user journals by identifying similar poems/stories/texts in a pre-collected corpus. A dispenser outputs a drink mix with flavors based on these discovered meanings, and prints a receipt to help users make sense of their experience.

To address this challenge, this paper develops Avatar Interpreter, a visual interface for synchronized sign language interpreters on an augmented reality head-mounted display. Avatar Interpreter can be displayed at different sizes and in different locations in space to fit different scenarios, helping deaf students to better receive sign language information and enhancing the classroom experience for deaf students.

Building on these findings, we developed EyeMeet, an eye-based joint attention support system that combines state-of-the-art real-time joint attention support with a retrospective attention feedback for remote meetings. In a four-week study, two student groups worked remotely on course assignments using EyeMeet.

However, it is not easy to eat in a metaverse while wearing an HMD because the Real Environment (RE) is not visible. Currently, users watch the RE’s food through the gap between the user’s face and the HMD (None) or superimposing a video see-through (VST) image on the VE, but these methods reduce the sense of presence. To allow natural eating in a VE, we propose Ukemochi that improves the presence and ease of eating. Ukemochi seamlessly overlays a food segmentation image inferred by deep neural networks on a VE. Ukemochi can be used simultaneously as a VE created with the OpenVR API and can be easily deployed for the metaverse. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of Ukemochi by comparing three visual presentation methods (None, VST, and Ukemochi) and two meal conditions (Hand condition and Plate condition). The experimental results demonstrated that Ukemochi enables users to maintain a high presence in VE and improve the ease of eating. We believe that our study will provide users with the experience of eating in the metaverse and encourage further research on eating in the metaverse.},

Moreover, we suggest a concrete idea: security questions to authenticate visitors in smart homes. In an interview study (N = 24), we found that owners and visitors appreciated the low effort and would adapt our approach.

We compared WARM against the narrative coding of casenotes written by caseworkers who used WARM. We found significant discrepancies between the casenotes and WARM data where WARM scores did not not mirror caseworkers’ notes about family risk.

The proposed method does not require any special hardware other than a regular microphone, thus enabling a complete hands-free interaction, and it can be used in a wide range of situations where speech recognition is already available.

We conduct an empirical users study (n = 1557) in which we observe how users interact with different cookie banner prompts. We find that for both possible slants, a negative framing is significantly more effective at nudging user decisions. We also find that the combination of slant and framing impact cookie opt-out rates by a factor of three.

This phenomenon has led to a population that experiences a plethora of technological objects and interfaces as they age, which become associated with certain stages of life and disappear thereafter. Noting the expanding body of literature within HCI about appropriation, our work pinpoints an area that needs more attention, “outdated technologies.” In other words, we assert that design practices can profit as much from imaginaries of the future as they can from reassessing artefacts from the past in a critical way. In a two-week fieldwork with 37 HCI students, we gathered an international collection of nostalgic devices from 14 different countries to investigate what memories people still have of older technologies and the ways in which these memories reveal normative and accidental use of technological objects. We found that participants primarily remembered older technologies with positive connotations and shared memories of how they had adapted and appropriated these technologies, rather than normative uses. We refer to this phenomenon as nostalgic reminiscence. In the future, we would like to develop this concept further by discussing how nostalgic reminiscence can be operationalized to stimulate speculative design in the present.},

With an iterative design process involving five participants, we designed VRBubble, a VR technique to facilitate peripheral awareness for PVI via spatial audio. Based on Hall’s proxemic theory, VRBubble divides the social space with three Bubbles—Intimate, Personal, and Social Bubble—generating spatial audio feedback to distinguish avatars in different bubbles and provide suitable avatar information. We provide three audio alternatives: earcons, verbal notifications, and sound effects. PVI can select and combine their preferred feedback alternatives for different social context to maintain avatar awareness in a dynamic social VR environment.},

In response, we conducted an online pilot categorization study (n=55) wherein we provided gender-expansive response options for rating four robots ranging across four levels of anthropomorphism. Findings indicate that people gender robots in diverse ways, and not necessarily in relation to the gender binary. Additionally, less anthropomorphic robots and the childlike humanoid robot were deemed masculine, while the iconic robot was deemed gender neutral, fluid, and/or ambiguous.

Distraction is an unavoidable problem in immersive virtual classes, which has a great detrimental impact on learning. However, how to intervene in students’ distraction behaviors in immersive virtual environments has not been thoroughly investigated up to now. In this paper, inspired by teachers’ instructional techniques in real-life classes, we propose three intervention strategies, namely eye contact, verbal warning and text warning, and explore the intervening effects of these strategies on the inattention of students seated at the front or back of a virtual classroom via eye tracking. Our results show that all of the proposed intervention strategies have positive impacts on the attention of students.

Then labels are often aggregated to create an annotated dataset suitable for supervised machine learning tasks. The most popular label aggregation method is majority voting, where each item in the dataset is assigned the most common label from the annotators. This approach is optimal when annotators are unbiased domain experts. In this paper, we propose Debiased Label Aggregation (DLA) an alternative method for label aggregation in subjective HITs, where cross-annotator agreement varies. DLA leverages user voting behavior patterns to weight labels. Our experiments show that DLA outperforms majority voting in several performance metrics; e.g. a percentage increase of 20 points in the F1 measure before data augmentation, and a percentage increase of 35 points in the same measure after data augmentation. Since DLA is deceptively simple, we hope it will help researchers to tackle subjective labeling tasks.},

To expand creative processes beyond professionals, it is crucial to accelerate this tedious process of creating design variants. To this end, we propose an algorithm that takes as input multiple image and text elements to generate several visually pleasing banner designs harmonized for text colors, font styles, and the placement of these multimodal assets. The generated layout accounts for background image saliency and uses this to select typographic and color variants yielding the harmonized outputs.

	abstract     = {Massively multiplayer online role-playing games create virtual communities that support heterogeneous “social roles” determined by gameplay interaction behaviors under a specific social context. For all social roles, formal roles are pre-defined, obvious, and explicitly ascribed to the people holding the roles, whereas informal roles are not well-defined and unspoken. Identifying the informal roles and understanding their subtle changes are critical to designing sociability mechanisms. However, it is nontrivial to understand the existence and evolution of such roles due to their loosely defined, interconvertible, and dynamic characteristics. We propose a visual analytics system, RoleSeer, to investigate informal roles from the perspectives of behavioral interactions and depict their dynamic interconversions and transitions. Two cases, experts’ feedback, and a user study suggest that RoleSeer helps interpret the identified informal roles and explore the patterns behind role changes. We see our approach’s potential in investigating informal roles in a broader range of social games.},

In this system paper, we develop and validate the safety of a mixed reality driving simulator system that enables us to superimpose virtual objects and events into the view of participants engaging in real-world driving in unmodified vehicles. To this end, we have validated the mixed reality system for basic driver cockpit and low-speed driving tasks, comparing the use of the system with non-headset and with the headset driving conditions, to ensure that participants behave and perform similarly using this system as they would otherwise. This paper outlines the operational procedures and protocols for using such systems for cockpit tasks (like using the parking brake, reading the instrument panel, and turn signaling) as well as basic low-speed driving exercises (such as steering around corners, weaving around obstacles, and stopping at a fixed line) in ways that are safe, effective, and lead to accurate, repeatable data collection about behavioral responses in real-world driving tasks.},

They are trackable when put on the display, rendering a real-time and high-precision tangible interface. Even for ordinary personal computers, enabling Centaur requires no new hardware and installation burden. Centaur’s cost-effectiveness and wide availability open up new opportunities for tangible user interface (TUI) users and practitioners. Centaur’s key innovation lies in its tracking method. It embeds high-frequency light signals into different portions of the display content as location beacons. When the tangibles are put on the screen, they are able to sense the light signals with their optical mouse sensors, and thus determine the locations accordingly. We develop four applications to showcase the potential usage of Centaur.},

We present a small interview-based study conducted with 9 experienced VUI industry practitioners. Their concerns range from terminological challenges associated with VUI design knowledge, the role of codifications of such knowledge like design guidelines alongside their practical design work, through to their views on the value of ‘harmonisation’ of VUI design knowledge. Given the complex—albeit preliminary—picture that emerges, we argue for HCI's deeper consideration of how design knowledge meshes with the contingencies of practice, so that VUI design knowledge—such as design guidelines developed in HCI—delivers the most potential value for industry practice.},

To fill this gap, we analyzed 8K posts from COVID-19 patients or caregivers requesting urgent medical assistance on Weibo, the largest microblogging site in China. Our mixed-methods analyses suggest that existing microblogging functions need to be improved in multiple aspects to sufficiently facilitate help-seeking in emergencies, including capabilities of search and tracking requests, ease of use, and privacy protection. We also find that people tend to stick to certain well-established functions for publishing requests, even after better alternatives emerge.

ReLive combines an in-situ virtual reality view with a complementary ex-situ desktop view.

	abstract     = {Most video-based learning content is designed for desktops without considering mobile environments. We (1) investigate the gap between mobile learners’ challenges and video engineers’ considerations using mixed methods and (2) provide design guidelines for creating mobile-friendly MOOC videos. To uncover learners’ challenges, we conducted a survey (n=134) and interviews (n=21), and evaluated the mobile adequacy of current MOOCs by analyzing 41,722 video frames from 101 video lectures. Interview results revealed low readability and situationally-induced impairments as major challenges. The content analysis showed a low guideline compliance rate for key design factors. We then interviewed 11 video production engineers to investigate design factors they mainly consider. The engineers mainly focus on the size and amount of content while lacking consideration for color, complex images, and situationally-induced impairments. Finally, we present and validate guidelines for designing mobile-friendly MOOCs, such as providing adaptive and customizable visual design and context-aware accessibility support.},

To explore the design and ethical considerations in this space, we interviewed 20 people who had recently seen sensitive content through Facebook’s Memories feature. Interviewees typically described how (1) expectedness, (2) context of viewing, and (3) what we describe as “affective sense-making” were important factors for how they perceived “bittersweet” content, a sensitizing concept from our interviews that we expand upon. To address these user needs, we pose provocations to support critical work in this area and we suggest that researchers and designers: (1) draw inspiration from no/low-technology artifacts, (2) use empirical research to identify contextual features that have negative impacts on users, and (3) conduct user studies on affective sense-making.

The emergence of the “unboxing” phenomenon in media suggests that introduction is key to technology adoption where initial impressions are made. To better understand this phenomenon toward designing a positive unboxing experience in the context of social robots for children, we conducted three field studies with families of children aged 8 to 13: (1) an exploratory free-play activity (n = 12); (2) a co-design session (n = 11) that informed the development of a prototype box and a curated unboxing experience; and (3) a user study (n = 9) that evaluated children’s experiences. Our findings suggest the unboxing experience of social robots can be improved through the design of a creative aesthetic experience that engages the child socially to guide initial interactions and foster a positive child-robot relationship.},

A comparative study (N=40) showed that Stylette lowered the learning curve, helping participants perform styling changes 35% faster than those using developer tools. By presenting various alternatives for a single goal, the tool helped participants familiarize themselves with CSS through experimentation.

The demographics of resistance are varied, with health, religious, and, increasingly, political concerns cited as reasons. With the COVID-19 pandemic igniting the fastest development of vaccines to date, mis- and disinformation about them have become inflammatory, with campaigning allegedly including racial targeting. Through a primarily qualitative investigation, this study inductively examines a large online vaccine discussion space that invokes references to the unethical Tuskegee Syphilis Study to understand how tactics of racial targeting of Black Americans might appear publicly. We find that such targeting is entangled with a genuine discussion about medical racism and vaccine hesitancy. Across 12 distinct voices that address race, medical racism, and vaccines, we discuss how mis- and disinformation sit alongside accurate information in a “polyvocal” space.},

To achieve this, we introduce VocabEncounter, a vocabulary-learning system that suitably encapsulates the given words into materials the user is reading in near real time by leveraging recent NLP techniques. After confirming the system’s human-comparable quality of generating translated phrases by involving crowdworkers, we conducted a series of user studies, which demonstrated its effectiveness on learning vocabulary and its favorable experiences.

In this work, we conducted a mixed-methods study, analyzing child welfare call screen workers’ decision-making over a span of four years, and interviewing them on how they incorporate algorithmic predictions into their decision-making process. Our data analysis shows that, compared to the algorithm alone, workers reduced the disparity in screen-in rate between Black and white children from 20% to 9%. Our qualitative data show that workers achieved this by making holistic risk assessments and adjusting for the algorithm’s limitations. Our analyses also show more nuanced results about how human-algorithm collaboration affects prediction accuracy, and how to measure these effects. These results shed light on potential mechanisms for improving human-algorithm collaboration in high-risk decision-making contexts.},

In this paper, we address this challenge and build on our prior work by adding fabrication components to the Mechanics-Dynamics-Aesthetics (MDA) framework. We use this f-MDA framework to analyze the 47 fabrication events from the prior study. We list the new player-object aesthetics that emerge from integrating the existing game mechanics with fabrication mechanics. We identify connections between these emergent player-object aesthetics and the existing game mechanics.

To investigate this, we present a controlled study of the memories prompted by three digital picture interactions (slideshow, gallery, and tabletop) on personal touchscreen devices. We find differences in how these tools and the interactions they support prompt reminiscence. In particular, gallery views prompt significantly fewer memories than either the tabletop or slideshow. Slideshows prompt significantly more external, factual memories, but not more person-centred memories, which are key to reminiscence.

In this work, we conducted interviews to figure out the challenges of prototyping pro-ges interactions in real-world IoT enhanced spaces. Based on the findings, we present ProGesAR, a mobile AR tool for prototyping pro-ges interactions of a subject in a real environment from a third-person view, and examining the prototyped interactions from both the first- and third- person views. Our interface supports the effects of virtual assets dynamically triggered by a single subject, with the triggering events based on four features: location, orientation, gesture, and distance. We conduct a preliminary study by inviting participants to prototype in a freeform manner using ProGesAR.

In this paper we propose co-teaching as a novel form of co-design practice. We describe a two year longitudinal Co-Teaching project resulting in the development and use of three digital designs for the classroom. Using the TPACK model to guide our reflections we offer insights into the ways that co-teaching can support the design and integration of educational technologies. We suggest that co-teaching as a form of co-design practice offers a way to move teachers from passive adopters of technology to active participants in the design and integration of educational technologies.},

	abstract     = {Conversational agents are being widely adopted across several domains to serve a variety of purposes ranging from providing intelligent assistance to companionship. Recent literature has shown that users develop intuitive folk theories and a metaphorical understanding of conversational agents (CAs) due to the lack of a mental model of the agents. However, investigation of metaphorical agent representation in the HCI community has mainly focused on the human level, despite non-human metaphors for agents being prevalent in the real world. We adopted Lakoff and Turner’s ‘Great Chain of Being’ framework to systematically investigate the impact of using non-human metaphors to represent conversational agents on worker engagement in crowdsourcing marketplaces. We designed a text-based conversational agent that assists crowd workers in task execution. Through a between-subjects experimental study (N = 341), we explored how different human and non-human metaphors affect worker engagement, the perceived cognitive load of workers, intrinsic motivation, and their trust in the agents. Our findings bridge the gap of how users experience CAs with non-human metaphors in the context of conversational crowdsourcing.},

Drawing on Rogers’ Protection Motivation Theory (PMT), this survey study explores Caribbean people’s (N=551) perceptions of safety threats and the factors contributing to their intention to adopt protective behaviors. Our analysis revealed that prior victimization was associated with increased perceptions of vulnerability and severity of harms, which, in turn, influenced elevated safety protection behaviors. For harassment-related harms in particular, participants’ trust in social media sites increased their intention to adopt protective behaviors. We observe significant country-to-country differences, which we contextualize through interviews with experts throughout the region. Our findings provide a new understanding of users’ mental models, behaviors, and attitudes with respect to online safety. We conclude by discussing theoretical and practical implications and outline opportunities for the design of inclusive and culturally-aware safety tools.},

However, while the importance of the emotions experienced on SNSs is clear, methods to catalog them, and systems to detect them, are less well developed. Accordingly, this paper reports on two studies using a novel contextually triggered Experience Sampling Method to log surveys immediately after using Instagram, a popular image-based SNS, thus minimizing recall biases. The first study improves our understanding of the emotions experienced while using SNSs. It suggests that common negative experiences relate to appearance comparison and envy. The second study captures smartphone sensor data during Instagram sessions to detect these two emotions, ultimately achieving peak accuracies of 95.78% (binary appearance comparison) and 93.95% (binary envy).},

The key issue that we identified is the lack of persistent connection between text and data. Thus, we developed CrossData, a prototype that treats text-data connections as persistent, interactive, first-class objects. By automatically identifying, establishing, and leveraging text-data connections, CrossData enables rich interactions to assist in the authoring of data documents. An expert evaluation with eight users demonstrated the usefulness of CrossData, showing that it not only reduced the manual effort in writing data documents but also opened new possibilities to bridge the gap between data exploration and writing.},

Instead, we propose conditional delegation as an alternative paradigm for human-AI collaboration where humans create rules to indicate trustworthy regions of a model. Using content moderation as a testbed, we develop novel interfaces to assist humans in creating conditional delegation rules and conduct a randomized experiment with two datasets to simulate in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios.

Unsafe conversations ranged from unwanted sexual solicitations to mental health related concerns, and images shared in unsafe conversations tended to be of people and convey negative emotions, while those shared in regular conversations more often conveyed positive emotions and contained objects. Further, unsafe conversations were significantly shorter, suggesting that youth disengaged when they felt unsafe.

	abstract     = {While much work is underway within the context of posthuman design, this research is often described from a dominantly human perspective. It rarely accounts for the creative capacities of nonhumans in design, such as materials, tools, and software. There is a need to further engage with posthuman theories conceptually, materially, and methodologically. We approach this challenge through Ron Wakkary's concept of repertoires: actions the human designer can take to increase participation of nonhumans in design research practice. This paper reports on potential repertoires' development by exploring three approaches from outside of HCI: describing the landscape, noticing, and translations. We use these methods to account for weaving events that the first author was engaged in. Through critical reflection of these accounts, we contribute three repertoires and an example of applying the theoretical framework of Designing Things.},

Implicit in the decision process is the perceived expertise of the AI system. In this paper, we investigate how people trust and rely on an AI assistant that performs with different levels of expertise relative to the person, ranging from completely overlapping expertise to perfectly complementary expertise. Through a series of controlled online lab studies where participants identified objects with the help of an AI assistant, we demonstrate that participants were able to perceive when the assistant was an expert or non-expert within the same task and calibrate their reliance on the AI to improve team performance. We also demonstrate that communicating expertise through the linguistic properties of the explanation text was effective, where embracing language increased reliance and distancing language reduced reliance on AI.},

	abstract     = {As algorithms are increasingly augmenting and substituting human decision-making, understanding how the introduction of computational agents changes the fundamentals of human behavior becomes vital. This pertains to not only users, but also those parties who face the consequences of an algorithmic decision. In a controlled experiment with 480 participants, we exploit an extended version of two-player ultimatum bargaining where responders choose to bargain with either another human, another human with an AI decision aid or an autonomous AI-system acting on behalf of a passive human proposer. Our results show strong responder preferences against the algorithm, as most responders opt for a human opponent and demand higher compensation to reach a contract with autonomous agents. To map these preferences to economic expectations, we elicit incentivized subject beliefs about their opponent’s behavior. The majority of responders maximize their expected value when this is line with approaching the human proposer. In contrast, responders predicting income maximization for the autonomous AI-system overwhelmingly override economic self-interest to avoid the algorithm.},

Given that humans cannot always agree on the right thing to do, how would ethical decision-making by AI systems be perceived and how would responsibility be ascribed in human-AI collaboration? In this study, we investigate how the expert type (human vs. AI) and level of expert autonomy (adviser vs. decider) influence trust, perceived responsibility, and reliance. We find that participants consider humans to be more morally trustworthy but less capable than their AI equivalent. This shows in participants’ reliance on AI: AI recommendations and decisions are accepted more often than the human expert’s. However, AI team experts are perceived to be less responsible than humans, while programmers and sellers of AI systems are deemed partially responsible instead.},

Here, we design and deploy Chirp, a mobile Twitter client, to independently examine how users experience external and internal supports. To develop Chirp, we identified 16 features that influence users’ sense of agency on Twitter through a survey of 129 participants and a design workshop. We then conducted a four-week within-subjects deployment with 31 participants. Our internal supports (including features to filter tweets and inform users when they have exhausted new content) significantly increased users’ sense of agency, while our external supports (a usage dashboard and nudges to close the app) did not. Participants valued our internal supports and said that our external supports were for “other people.” Our findings suggest that design patterns promoting agency may serve users better than screen time tools.},

However, our field has yet to establish a cohesive, systematic understanding of the challenges, benefits, and commitments of community-collaborative approaches to research. We conducted a systematic review and thematic analysis of 47 computing research papers discussing participatory research with communities for the development of technological artifacts and systems, published over the last two decades. From this review, we identified seven themes associated with the evolution of a project: from establishing community partnerships to sustaining results. Our findings suggest that several tensions characterize these projects, many of which relate to the power and position of researchers, and the computing research environment, relative to community partners. We discuss the implications of our findings and offer methodological proposals to guide HCI, and computing research more broadly, towards practices that center communities.},

We explore how digital technology can assist citizens, promoting peer support to create meaningful, personalised healthcare infrastructures. This qualitative study contributes insights from interviews and focus groups with 24 disabled citizens, informal caregivers and healthcare officers, to provide understanding of their experiences and practices. These insights highlight relational care, invisible labour, power struggles with authorities and how citizens seek socio-technical capability.

Inspired by the potential of Virtual Reality (VR) to support profound emotional experiences, we explored if a VR flying interface with more embodied self-motion cues could contribute to the benefits associated with flying dreams (i.e., STE and empowerment). Our results indicated that a flying interface with more self-motion cues indeed better supported STE and empowerment. We derived several design considerations: obscurity, extraordinary light and supportive setting. Our results contribute to the discourse around design guidelines for self-transcendence and empowerment in VR, which may further be applied to the improvement of mental well-being.},
