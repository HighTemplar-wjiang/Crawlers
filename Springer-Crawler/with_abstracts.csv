article,"X-ray Fluorescence Spectroscopy was performed to characterize pigment materials in a preliminary study of two mural paintings in the Catacombs of San Giovanni. XRF was one non-invasive, analytical technique employed as part of a comprehensive examination, which also included multispectral imaging and 3D modeling. XRF analysis contributed towards a better idea of the materials present, but definitive assignments for the pigments were not possible. The murals show some signs of degradation products including a calcium sulfate surface encrustation, and a bluish-black copper based pigment, which we suspect is the degradation of azurite into tenorite.",,2022-07-22 11:32:24 +1000,2022-07-22 11:33:06 +1000,10.1007/978-3-319-13695-0_71,,,,697--705,"Non-invasive Materials Analysis Using Portable X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) in the Examination of Two Mural Paintings in the Catacombs of San Giovanni, Syracuse",,2014,http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-13695-0_71,"[{'first': 'Samantha', 'last': 'Stout'}, {'first': 'Antonino', 'last': 'Cosentino'}, {'first': 'Carmelo', 'last': 'Scandurra'}]","Digital Heritage.

article,"Security and efficiency for resource constrained devices using lightweight cryptography techniques is still a problem. It is important to make these devices secure from the intruders and communicate with them securely. Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) comes out to be a major contender to solve this problem as it provides the security using smaller key length. Since the conventional ECC works on predefined and fixed curves, the elliptic curves are analysed thoroughly since the emergence of ECC. This paper, proposes an implementation of dynamic elliptic curves which are secure and feasible for Internet of Things (IoT) devices and other devices which require lightweight cryptography for security. The experimental results show the feasibility and efficiency of the algorithm used to generate dynamic curve for cryptography. Also, a new curve will be generated at each runtime. It would be nearly impossible for intruders to exploit and retract information from the devices. Hence, the proposed technique is more secure and practically efficient for resource constrained devices.",,2022-07-22 11:32:24 +1000,2022-07-22 11:33:01 +1000,10.1007/978-3-030-76776-1_13,,,,193--204,Design and Implementation of Lightweight Dynamic Elliptic Curve Cryptography Using Schoof's Algorithm,,2021,http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-76776-1_13,"[{'first': 'Ansh', 'last': 'Tyagi'}, {'first': 'K.', 'middle': 'K.

article,"Owing to the continual attacks by pests particularly the bark-beetles (viz borers), there has been tremendous destruction of the forest resources. Beetle attacks are also responsible for severe production loss in commercial crops, thus leading to distress to farmers. In this paper, we have presented a novel approach to detect the pest attack in yielding cashew trees at early stage, i.e. to develop a portable unit. The preliminary analysis of bark samples (taken at height of 1.5 meter) shows a clear distinction between the good and infested trees. Also, the chlorophyll analysis performed on leaf samples shows the result for good and different stages of infestation as decrease in absorbance values of the leaf extract. The proposed design will indicate the status of a cashew tree by analysing the chlorophyll content of leaves and conductivity of bark, both of which will be utilised to make an ultimate confirmation.",,2022-07-22 11:32:24 +1000,2022-07-22 11:33:04 +1000,10.1007/s40012-018-0198-8,,2277-9078,,215--219,Farmer-friendly portable system for diagnosis of pest attack in cashew trees,6,2018,http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40012-018-0198-8,"[{'first': 'Yogini', 'last': '{Venkatraman Prabhu}'}, {'first': 'Jivan', 'middle': 'S.', 'last': 'Parab'}, {'first': 'Rajendra', 'middle': 'S.', 'last': 'Gad'}, {'first': 'Gaurish', 'middle': 'M.', 'last': 'Naik'}]",CSI Transactions on ICT,2,http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40012-018-0198-8,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40012-018-0198-8,,,,

article,"For the future development of cultural technology, access to the cultural foundations of these culture carriers is necessary. One established theory of this cultural foundation is the collective unconsciousness with archetypes as building blocks. A methodological challenge is adequate access to these unconscious layers of the human mind. Recent research in neuroscience contributes in ways to determine the minimally conscious state. Combining these neuroscience results with the upcoming development of brain/body-computer interfaces enables us to envision new ways to establish interactions among culture carriers like humans and their cultural determinations. First, we present an overview of the known ways to get access to conscious layers, and then we discuss the potential of upcoming approaches. New technology enables us to develop new types of interfaces which are directly connected to brain/body processes. Next to direct brain connections, we introduce and discuss the possibilities of tapping into other physiological processes, especially processes of the autonomous nervous system. Finally, we are presenting and discussing the theoretical implications of the architecture of the human mind and the interfaces between all components of the conscious and unconscious parts.

article,"Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks grow rapidly and cause a serious risk to network security. DDoS attacks intentionally occupy resources such as computing power and bandwidth to deny the services to potential users. So the automatic identification of DDoS attacks is very important. Machine Learning is the proven technology for the identification of such attacks. Over the decade many researchers have taken detection of DDoS attacks as the research objective and succeeded as well. However many more research needs to be explored in the identification of DDoS attacks due to the inefficiency of their techniques in terms of performance, accuracy, identification, and collection of data, normalized data set, feature reduction, and computational cost. We tried Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) with supervised machine learning technique to recognize the DDoS attacks at Network/Transport layer. We experimented with a dataset consisting of 4 lakh records of synthetic data, out of which we used 70% of the dataset for training purpose and performance measure on the rest 30% of the dataset.

article,"In the early growth stages of young crops, weeds compete for living resources while often grow close together and with overlaps. Conventional weeding techniques such as mechanical weeding and herbicide application are not precision methods. To allow for high precision target and spraying of weeds, autonomous field robots equipped with computer vision systems could be deployed to manage and control the weeds in the crop line. The robots are therefore required to classify weeds at pixel-level accuracy with high recall rates. This paper presents a pixel-level weed classification model using rotation-invariant uniform local binary pattern (LBP) features. The model design is based on an ensemble with a two-level optimisation structure. The first-level leverages on Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimisation to select the best rotation-invariant uniform LBP configurations. The second level utilises covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) in the Neural Network (NN) ensemble to select the best combinations of voting weights of the predicted outcome for each classifier. This model design allows for different feature inputs selected by GA for each of the NN classifiers in the ensemble, unlike classical ensembles which share the same input data. For ensemble weight optimisation, we compared differential evolution, particle swarm optimisation, and CMA-ES. A crop/weed field image dataset public dataset consisting of 60 images of weeds and carrots at early true leaf stage was used for validation with existing works. The results demonstrated that our LBP-based pixel-level classifier exhibits excellent predictive capability with high recall and F1 scores when compared to the literature. It was found that CMA-ES optimised ensemble gave the best configuration and demonstrated a classification accuracy of 87.9%, which exceeded the existing statistical feature classification of 85.9%. This highlights some potentialities for chip-based application-specific integrated circuit LBP pixel-level weed classification in smart agriculture applications.",,2022-07-22 11:32:24 +1000,2022-07-22 11:33:07 +1000,10.1007/s42979-020-00357-y,,2662-995X,,,Pixel-Level Weed Classification Using Evolutionary Selection of Local Binary Pattern in a Stochastic Optimised Ensemble,1,2020,http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42979-020-00357-y,"[{'first': 'Basil', 'middle': 'Andy', 'last': 'Lease'}, {'first': 'W.', 'middle': 'K.', 'last': 'Wong'}, {'first': 'Lenin', 'last': 'Gopal'}, {'first': 'Choo', 'middle': 'W.

article,"In this paper, we propose a novel cooperative abnormal sound event detection framework for city surveillance in end-edge-cloud orchestrated systems. A novel offloading decision-making scheme that leverages hierarchical computational capabilities is proposed to speed up the detection process. The audio pre-processing (feature extraction) and post-processing (sound source localization and sound event classification) can be locally executed or offloaded to the edge or cloud based on the calculation of the so-called communication-to-computation ratio. Furthermore, considering the biased audio information due to source-sensor geometries, a cooperative decision-making algorithm is proposed to aggregate the sound event classification results with adaptive control and ensemble learning. In the audio pre-processing, the log-mel spectrogram and time of arrival information are first extracted from the audio waveform captured by the distributed acoustic sensors and then sent to the computation entity assigned by the offloading scheme. In the audio post-processing, the sound source is localized through least-square minimization. Guided by the localized sound source, the spectrograms are fed into the pre-trained neural networks and then the result aggregation algorithm for further classification. Extensive experiments regarding latency and detection accuracy show the superiority and robustness of the proposed scheme, avoiding the cumulative latency caused by the increased number of sensors while maintaining high detection accuracy.",,2022-07-22 11:32:24 +1000,2022-07-22 11:33:01 +1000,10.1007/s42045-020-00042-x,,2520-8462,,158--170,Cooperative abnormal sound event detection in end-edge-cloud orchestrated systems,3,2020,http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42045-020-00042-x,"[{'first': 'Jingrong', 'last': 'Wang'}, {'first': 'Kaiyang', 'last': 'Liu'}, {'first': 'George', 'last': 'Tzanetakis'}, {'first': 'Jianping', 'last': 'Pan'}]",CCF Transactions on Networking,3-4,http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42045-020-00042-x,https://doi.org/10.1007/s42045-020-00042-x,,,,

article,"In data center networks (DCN), large scale flows produced by parallel computing frameworks form many coflows semantically. Most inter-coflow schedulers only focus on the remaining data of coflows and attempt to mimic Shortest Job First (SJF). However, a coflow may consist of multiple stages, where a coflow has different amounts of data to transmit. In this paper, we consider the Multi-stage Inter-Coflow Scheduling problem and try to give an efficient online scheduling scheme. We first explore a short-sighted algorithm, IAO, with the greedy strategy. This gives us an insight into utilizing the network resources. Based on that, we propose a far-sighted heuristic, MLBF, which schedules sub-coflows to occupy network bandwidth in turn. Furthermore, we remove the bijection assumption and propose a new practical heuristic, MPLBF. Through simulations in various network environments, we show that, compared to a state-of-the-art scheduler—Varys, a multi-stage aware scheduler can reduce the coflow completion time by up to 4.81 ",,2022-07-22 11:32:24 +1000,2022-07-22 11:33:04 +1000,10.1007/s42045-019-00018-6,,2520-8462,,83--97,Efficient scheduling for multi-stage coflows,2,2019,http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42045-019-00018-6,"[{'first': 'Shuai', 'last': 'Zhang'}, {'first': 'Sheng', 'last': 'Zhang'}, {'first': 'Zhuzhong', 'last': 'Qian'}, {'first': 'Xiaoda', 'last': 'Zhang'}, {'first': 'Mingjun', 'last': 'Xiao'}, {'first': 'Jie', 'last': 'Wu'}, {'first': 'Jidong', 'last': 'Ge'}, {'first': 'Xiaoliang', 'last': 'Wang'}]",CCF Transactions on Networking,2,http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42045-019-00018-6,https://doi.org/10.1007/s42045-019-00018-6,,,,

In this research, we try to find the answers for the following research questions to upgrade AODV protocol in security concern. I). Does node mobility in a MANET impact the behavior of a malicious node? II). Is node mobility need to be considered when designing appropriate security countermeasures? We used Network Simulator 2 (NS2) for simulations and AODV as routing protocol. Blackhole and Grayhole attacks are selected to study the network layer based Active attacks and Wormhole attack is used for Passive attack. We observed the impacts of each attacks by changing the speed of nodes and the numbers of connected node in the network. We changed the directions of node mobility randomly during the simulation. Though node speed is constant for all nodes. Number of nodes and nodes speed are changed to collect more accurate results. We compared the performances of each network with a controller. Few Performance Matrices (PM) (Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), End to End Delay (EED) and Throughput) are used to evaluate the network performances. Mobile nodes degrade the network performances. Node mobility either leads to break the links between nodes nor to create new links. Therefore it creates an opportunity to break the link with malicious node. We can screen the malicious node at routing if a routing protocol is equipped with an initial screening mechanism for malicious nodes.

article,"Smart home technology is an up-and-coming field of automation that integrates different areas, including sensing and electrical automation subsystems, devices, mechanical and hydraulic systems associated with sophisticated control and supervising. Recently these systems also received an extra mission to assist particular users, as older adults or patients who need intensive care. Such a challenge brings enormous pressure in developing engineering requirements that match automation goals with those raised by telemedicine and healthcare. Treating these smart healthcare homes as a system-of-systems, we have to consider a social goal that matches comfort, security, and flexibility with intensive care, protection, and telemedicine. The proposal presented in this paper is based on a multilayer approach: one layer is responsible for the physical home automation and the other with healthcare and the coupling with the final user, reinforcing a service design approach. Both are intelligent systems, which justifies using AI (Artificial Intelligence) planning, where automated processes achieve each system’s goals. That change substantially home-automation projects, which should be designed to be reused, and creates a link to healthcare and telemedicine. An illustrative case study is used to present the proposal based on a process that monitors old adults’ night sleep using home automation features associated with a planned healthcare process. Shortly we expect that the formal method presented here could be fully inserted in software tools (or in a commercially available system) to become an option for practical work.",,2022-07-22 11:32:24 +1000,2022-07-22 11:32:59 +1000,10.1007/s41050-021-00029-7,,2520-8497,,1--14,A Multilayer Proposal to a Smart Home Applied to Healthcare,4,2021,http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41050-021-00029-7,"[{'first': 'Jose', 'middle': 'Reinaldo', 'last': 'Silva'}, {'first': 'Euler', 'middle': 'Cassio Tavares', 'last': 'Macedo'}, {'first': 'Yaney', 'middle': 'Gomez', 'last': 'Correa'}, {'first': 'Rafael', 'middle': 'Pereira', 'last': 'Medeiros'}]",Polytechnica,1,http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41050-021-00029-7,https://doi.org/10.1007/s41050-021-00029-7,,,,

article,"Increasing light absorption through surface textured transparent films is gaining importance in the development of high-efficiency solar cells. However, most of the textured films are produced by replication with imprinting stamps that are fabricated by resource-intensive and expensive lithography-based techniques. In this work, we employed lotus leaves as low-cost imprinting stamps to fabricate large-area transparent polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) films decorated with micron-scale features. Subsequently, we investigate the optical and light-harvesting properties of those micro-textured PDMS films to improve the efficiency of crystalline silicon solar cells. The combined influence of the anti-reflective SiNx dielectric layer and the laminated PDMS films on solar cells was also examined. The graded refractive index imparted at the air-silicon interface by the textured PDMS films containing micro-posts reduced the reflectance. In those solar cells without the SiNx coating, the lamination of textured PDMS significantly reduced the solar-weighted reflectance by more than 40%, increased short-circuit current density by 6.5% and improved the power conversion efficiency by 10%. However, the textured PDMS films exhibited marginal improvement of power conversion efficiency (1.3%) on SiNx coated crystalline solar cells, although the reduction in solar-weighted reflectance by 30%. We believe that the biomimetic micro-textured PDMS films proposed in this paper prove to be cost-effective candidates for enhancing the light-absorption capacity of highly efficient crystalline silicon solar cells.",,2022-07-22 11:32:24 +1000,2022-07-22 11:33:05 +1000,10.1007/s41403-021-00244-9,,2662-5415,,775--785,Light Harvesting Using Biomimetic Micro-textured Transparent Films for Photovoltaic Applications,6,2021,http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41403-021-00244-9,"[{'first': 'Sohail', 'last': 'Ahmad'}, {'first': 'Himani', 'last': 'Sharma'}, {'first': 'Amit', 'last': 'Agrawal'}, {'first': 'Suhas', 'middle': 'S.', 'last': 'Joshi'}]",Transactions of the Indian National Academy of Engineering,3,http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41403-021-00244-9,https://doi.org/10.1007/s41403-021-00244-9,,,,

Due to the rapid development of computer vision and machine learning technology, machine with intelligence has started replacing human beings to observe, perceive and analyze the explosive growth of image and video data. Computer vision and machine learning-based human behavior recognition is one of these tasks, which has become a particularly hot research topic in many different fields, such as intelligent monitoring, human–computer interaction, smart home, virtual reality, and medical diagnosis. In this study, we survey systematically the popular methods, algorithms, models and well-known action datasets in human behavior analysis in the past two decades. In addition, the advantages and disadvantages of the methods are discussed and propitious future research directions are also presented. The results of this survey reveal that paradigms of human behavior analysis is being shifted from traditional RGB to RGB-D, from deep learning to more intelligent and automated deep reinforcement learning, and from fixed camera devices to portable devices and channel state information (CSI), and paradigms based on automated deep reinforcement learning and portable devices and CSI would become some hot topics for future research on human behavior analysis.",,2022-07-22 11:32:24 +1000,2022-07-22 11:32:59 +1000,10.1007/s42979-021-00932-x,,2662-995X,,,A Systematic Survey on Human Behavior Recognition Methods,3,2022,http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42979-021-00932-x,"[{'first': 'Meixue', 'last': 'Yuan'}, {'first': 'Shouke', 'last': 'Wei'}, {'first': 'Jindong', 'last': 'Zhao'}, {'first': 'Ming', 'last': 'Sun'}]",SN Computer Science,1,http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42979-021-00932-x,https://doi.org/10.1007/s42979-021-00932-x,,,,

article,"EDEN ISS is an H2020 project aimed at testing key technologies for plant cultivation in large-scale closed environments for a future implementation in space habitats. In this light, a Future Exploration Greenhouse has been designed, developed and deployed at the highly isolated German Neumayer III Antarctic Station to simulate the harsh conditions of an extra planetary outpost mission and test a typical space operation scenario. The greenhouse has been equipped with all the systems to control the environmental parameters (temperature, relative humidity, light intensity, etc.), and to accommodate and feed the plants during their lifecycle. A camera system has been implemented for plant status assessment via remote image analysis. A command and data handling system provides the capability to configure the experimental set points via software, and can be controlled by remote operators. A Mission Control Centre has been realized at DLR for remote monitoring and control of the facility. The MCC receives all the telemetry and the images and can make them available to other centres, which have been included in the operations loop to provide expert support to the on-site operator. This paper describes the facility and its capabilities as platform for fresh food production experiments in an extreme environment. It is an extended version of a paper presented at the AIDAA Congress 2019, in the Technical Session “Red Planet Exploration”.",,2022-07-22 11:32:24 +1000,2022-07-22 11:33:10 +1000,10.1007/s42496-020-00051-5,,0365-7442,,171--185,The EDEN ISS Facility as Platform for Plant Experiments in Extreme Environments,99,2020,http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42496-020-00051-5,"[{'first': 'Raimondo', 'last': 'Fortezza'}, {'first': 'Antonio', 'last': 'Ceriello'}, {'first': 'Domenico', 'last': '{De Simone}'}, {'first': 'Daniel', 'last': 'Schubert'}, {'first': 'Paul', 'last': 'Zabel'}, {'first': 'Conrad', 'last': 'Zeidler'}, {'first': 'Vincent', 'last': 'Vrakking'}]",Aerotecnica Missili & Spazio,3,http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42496-020-00051-5,https://doi.org/10.1007/s42496-020-00051-5,,,,

article,"In Human–Machine Teaming environments, it is important to identify potential performance drops due to cognitive overload. If identified correctly, they can help improve the performance of the human–machine system by offloading some tasks to less cognitively overloaded users. This can help prevent user error that can result in critical failures. Also, it can improve productivity by keeping the human operators at an optimal performance state. This paper explores a new method for identifying user cognitive load by a three-class classification using brain activity data and by applying a convolutional neural network and long short-term memory model. The data collected from a set of cognitive benchmark experiments were used to train the model, which was then tested on two separate datasets consisting of more ecologically valid task environments. We experimented with various models built with different benchmark tasks to explore which benchmark tasks were better suited for the prediction of task shedding events in these compound tasks that are more representative of real-world scenarios. We also show that this method can be extended across-tasks and across-subject pools.",,2022-07-22 11:32:24 +1000,2022-07-22 11:33:05 +1000,10.1007/s41133-020-00034-y,,2365-4317,,,Identification of Potential Task Shedding Events Using Brain Activity Data,5,2020,http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41133-020-00034-y,"[{'first': 'Danushka', 'last': 'Bandara'}, {'first': 'Trevor', 'last': 'Grant'}, {'first': 'Leanne', 'last': 'Hirshfield'}, {'first': 'Senem', 'last': 'Velipasalar'}]",Augmented Human Research,1,http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41133-020-00034-y,https://doi.org/10.1007/s41133-020-00034-y,,,,
article,"Heat transfer enhancement in the low Reynolds number condition is increasingly required with the perpetual attempt to integrate and miniaturize electronic devices. The authors have suggested the application of photo-rheological fluid, whose rheological properties change by external photic stimulus, to a coolant of small heat exchangers. High heat transfer state and low pressured drop state can be switched by light irradiation to the fluid according to the demand for heat transfer enhancement.
 This study investigated how the change of viscoelasticity of photosensitive micellar solutions by light irradiation relates to flow structure and heat transfer performance. Flow visualization and heat transfer measurement were conducted using an aqueous solution of surfactant and counterions (cetyl-trimethyl-ammonium bromide/sodium salicylate/ortho-methoxy cinnamic acid) with different light irradiation time in serpentine channels. The results showed that the decrease of the viscoelasticity with light irradiation caused the decrease in heat transfer rate and pressure drop. In the flow visualization, two types of secondary vortex, i.e., a single large-scaled vortex and a pair of counter-rotating vortices, were observed. As the light irradiation time increased, flow unsteadiness diminished, and the frequency in the appearance of a single vortex and fast flow near wall decreased. The decrease in heat transfer rate and pressure drop with light irradiation was ascribed to the deterioration of fluid mixing by flow unsteadiness, the reduction of momentum and thermal diffusion by the decrease in near-wall velocity gradient, and the decrease in the strength of a pair of vortices.",,2022-07-22 11:32:24 +1000,2022-07-22 11:33:00 +1000,10.1007/s12572-018-0216-y,,0975-0770,,171--178,Change of flow structure and heat transfer performance of photosensitive micellar solutions with light irradiation,10,2018,http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12572-018-0216-y,"[{'first': 'Shogo', 'last': 'Tsuchikawa'}, {'first': 'Reiko', 'last': 'Kuriyama'}, {'first': 'Ikuya', 'last': 'Sakanaka'}, {'first': 'Takeshi', 'last': 'Enya'}, {'first': 'Kazuya', 'last': 'Tatsumi'}, {'first': 'Kazuyoshi', 'last': 'Nakabe'}]",International Journal of Advances in Engineering Sciences and Applied Mathematics,2,http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12572-018-0216-y,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12572-018-0216-y,,,,

These gesture controls are used as input devices to computer systems. These existing systems are costly and unaffordable by general uses. The idea proposed in the article is to make a cheaper version of a hand gesture controller using the Arduino board. The input is given with the help of a pair of ultrasonic sensors. The sensors are used to calculate the changes in the distance of our hand movements while giving the gesture. The Arduino will calculate the changes in distance and recognize the action done by the user. The Arduino will request the system processor to perform the requested action by the user.

Then, there is a high risk of fire which leads to catastrophic accidents, and so, there arises a need to have a reliable warning system that can warn potential gas leak and fire. Installation of fire detectors and gas detectors is the most reliable warning systems to tackle the early situations that ultimately prevent the accident to occur. Together, both systems come under a name of fire and gas detection system. Selection and installation of fire and gas detectors is a complex process that varies with the plant to plant and difference in processing units and their respective machines layout makes installation of fire and gas detectors really challenging. This review elucidates structured procedure and design considerations of fire and gas detection systems for a process plant involving various operations.

article,"India is one of the major producers and exporters of silk across the world. Sericulture is the term used for the cultivation of silkworms for the production of silk. It includes farming of mulberry, rearing of silkworm, reeling, and twisting to make raw silk. Sericulture is a part of Indian culture especially in the southern states of India are famous for the mulberry silks. Seeds for the production of silkworms are produced in reeling units by mating male and female moths. This requires separation of male and females based on gender. Segregating males and females is a tedious task and this is done in the pupa stage of the silkworm life cycle. In other stages classification is very difficult. The conventional method of gender classification in grainage centers is by expert employees with physical observation. Due to the long hours of work and human errors misclassification occurs and which affects quality seed production. Also for the physical observation cutting of cocoon is needed to take the pupa out and this will damage silk filament as well as sometimes the pupa. Classification of silkworm cocoon has another advantage as male cocoons produce finer silk than females so classification will help to reduce the mixing of silk with different quality.

article,"The applicability of exoskeletons in different daily and occupational settings is continually increasing. Due to varying tasks and user groups, the adaptability of exoskeletons is becoming more significant, with increasing demands for smarter devices. The implementation of force sensors in exoskeletal interfaces could be an approach for analyzing the human-machine interaction in terms of, e.g., wearing comfort, support, and motion synchronicity, as well as optimizing this interaction in real time based on the analyzed sensory data. For this, force sensors need to be embedded in interfaces, which implies the consideration of inexpensive sensors to minimize the total purchase price. However, measuring contact forces on the wearer is challenging and inexpensive flexible force sensing resistors have limited accuracy, repeatability, and stability. This paper evaluates the suitability of an interface principle working with two water capsules and two embedded piezo-resistive pressure sensors in different test scenarios derived from real exoskeletal application examples. Finally, a comparison of the capsules’ inner pressures reliably detects different load conditions on the interface such as centered, edged, and shear forces.

article,"Since being the Second largest population in the world, there is a vast amount of garbage being generated every day. There is a problem of trash barrel management in India as there are a limited number of trash barrel that are to be shared by many houses in total. Sometime completely filled trash barrel would not get empty on the required time due to non-availability of its information which may cause hygienic issues as well as dangerous diseases like malaria, dengue, etc. One more problem is that since all garbage bins that are situated near residential areas, they emit various harmful gases which are very hazardous for human health and also the garbage is thrown out of the bin also emits harmful gases, so for this problem also we are trying to proposed a system also. Smart trash barrel management system is being developed, which measure the level of waste in the trash barrel; when the waste reaches the point of concern (gets full or nearly full), an alarm is generated with a signal to the concerned authority so that it get empty on time. The trash level is measured in real time with sensors and signal to municipal corporation when the bin is full or about to full by SMS using GSM module specifying the location of the bin. The system is also embedded with a mechanism to purify the harmful gases emitted from the bin. This uses a system which can neutralize the effect of these harmful gases. Rain sensor is also used so that when there is a condition arises of waste getting wet, the garbage lid automatically gets closed so that waste does not get wet or get spoiled. The system includes steps to resolve the problem of garbage outside the bin by checking for the presence of a person and generating an alarm in case the garbage is out of or near the box. Since all the present smart bin project based on the model that they only check the bin storage level and generate a alert, the proposed system includes mechanism to suck the air from the trash as sometimes garbage bin gets filled due to gossamer substance which occupy a major portion of bin, by compressing the waste then more waste material can be put in the bin so the cleaning cycle gets reduced or become more effective.",,2022-07-22 11:32:24 +1000,2022-07-22 11:33:08 +1000,10.1007/978-981-15-4936-6_19,,,,177--182,Smart Trash Barrel: An IoT-Based System for Smart Cities,,2021,http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-15-4936-6_19,"[{'first': 'Ruchi', 'last': 'Goel'}, {'first': 'Sahil', 'last': 'Aggarwal'}, {'first': 'A.', 'last': 'Sharmila'}, {'first': 'Azim', 'middle': 'Uddin', 'last': 'Ansari'}]",Information Management and Machine Intelligence,,http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-15-4936-6_19,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-15-4936-6_19,,,,

This leads to tremendous financial losses for farmers. Farmers are not permitted to barricade entire fields or stay on the field 24 h a day and keep them safe. An automatic system for the safety against birds is being proposed. Our system consists of cameras that monitor the field for 24 × 7 and when a bird is being detected within the field it produces an irritating sound to the birds using ultrasonic sound waves. Current advances in deep learning technology allow for application in this field, reducing the amount of manual labor necessary for surveillance of regions.

article,Topographic maps are used by a variety of disciplines that require detailed information about the features of the Earth’s surface. These maps are traditionally created by surveyors in the field by measuring sets of points throughout a coverage area. These measurements are then converted into a topographic map representing the terrain by the use of contour lines. The focus of this research is to reduce the cost and time efforts for surveying land to generate topographic maps. We introduce an approach for developing a low-cost autonomous quadcopter UAV that uses LiDAR and CMOS image (camera) data to perform coverage area survey to generate topographic maps.

This paper considers the electrochemical kinetic model of alkaline methanol oxidation, the process, relevant for the design of efficient fuel cells. Fuel cells of direct methanol type have a great advantage in safety and storage compared to hydrogen-oxygen fuel cells. They possess high energy density and are especially suitable for portable applications. The oxidation of fuel in an alkaline medium allows the use of affordable electrodes.The mathematical model of the oxidation process includes a system of non-linear differential equations of high order, describing elementary reactions. The model also possesses 14 unknown reaction constants and 6 dynamic variables describing surface coverages of the intermediates. These variables cannot be measured directly, but can be reconstructed by the parameter identification procedure. The procedure comprises numerical integration of the system of differential equations, automatic global minimization of the distance between measured and modeled cyclic voltammograms, iterative Monte Carlo search and interactive parameter study.The developed methods have been applied to 9 cyclic voltammograms of cells with different concentrations of alkaline and fuel. The reaction constants have been reconstructed, their dependence on concentrations has been discussed.

PCF is better than an optical fiber due to its high flexibility in design and high nonlinearity. PCF is basically an optical fiber with a low regular arrangement refractive index material in the background, with a high refractive index. Either by modifying the total internal reflection or photonic bandgap guidance, light can be guided within the PCF. A few optical parameters like birefringence, chromatic dispersion, effective mode area, loss of confinement, and nonlinearity can be determined by PCF. Due to their unique geometric structure, PCF presents special properties and capabilities that lead to an outstanding potential for sensing applications. Generally, PCF is designed to get zero dispersion wavelengths (ZDW) at the required wavelength.

To achieve the desired motor speed, the stator voltage control method has been applied by using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) technique. For reversing the motor direction of rotation, the stator magnetic field is reversed by swapping the contacts of auxiliary winding by relay operation.

article,"One of the challenging aspects of mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is to sustain a route for prolonged time. Paths break due to the erratic haphazard passage of nodes involved within a path. When a path breaks, packets may be lost and establishing new path demands additional control packets. So, instead of re-establishing path after breakdown, a node can predict the link failure and then take necessary action to find an alternate path for routing packets. Simple Ant Routing Algorithm (SARA) protocol is an ant colony routing (ACR) protocol that is used to establish the route in MANET. In this protocol, route repair is initiated only after the link failure. By incorporating received signal strength (RSS) metric, we can predict route failure and initiate route repair even before it fails. This way we can reduce the delay and increase packet delivery during transmission. The modified protocol was simulated using NS2, and it was found that the modification indeed helps us in delivering more packets with a reduction in delay.",,2022-07-22 11:32:24 +1000,2022-07-22 11:33:08 +1000,10.1007/978-981-33-6691-6_38,,,,341--348,Signal Strength-Based Routing Using Simple Ant Routing Algorithm,,2021,http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-33-6691-6_38,"[{'first': 'Mani', 'middle': 'Bushan', 'last': 'Dsouza'}, {'first': 'D.', 'middle': 'H.', 'last': 'Manjaiah'}]","Cybernetics, Cognition and Machine Learning Applications",,http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-33-6691-6_38,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-33-6691-6_38,,,,
article,Mars region is being imaged with an exceptional combination of spectral and spatial resolution spectrometer using OMEGA instrument. The hyperspectral images of Mars provide spectral range and chemical species with high resolution. This paper presents a novel unsupervised segmentation algorithm named as evolutionary component analysis for remotely sensed hyperspectral image data for material identification in the spatial and spectral information. Sparse multinomial logistic regression (SMLR) algorithm is initially employed to learn the posterior probability distributions from the spatial and spectral information of the images containing class imbalance information to infer the class distribution of the testing hyperspectral data. Evolutionary multifactorial spectral analysis (ESA) helps to characterize noise and extremely mixed pixels with less training set with high training quality and utility with respect to spectral signatures and its spectral changes with less interaction for classification and end-member detection. The proposed segmentation approach based on ESA is investigated and estimated using both real and simulated hyperspectral datasets. ESA is evaluated for the endmember extraction in the mixed pixel revealing up-to-date performance when compared with advanced hyperspectral image classification techniques. The combined spatial–contextual information (ESA + SMLR) characterizes a state-of-the-art contribution in the research field of material identification.

Existing systems and methods of monitoring crops use wireless sensor network to collect data from the different sensors deployed at various nodes and send it through the wireless protocol. In this study, regression analysis (R.A.) is used to stress environmental factors and crop yields.

article,"In this chapter, we consider a hybrid optical-radio wireless network as a flexible, secure and high-performance communication network for the hospital of the future. The network consists of access points as well as devices capable to communicate using optical and radio technologies. Wireless body area networks (WBAN) are one of the key elements needed to achieve the desired goals. Within the proposed hybrid network, we extend the conventional WBAN concept to a more generic and highly flexible, reconfigurable optical-radio wireless body area network (RORWBAN). Ultimately, the concept of hospital of the future aims at enhancing healthcare while using thoughtfully and efficiently hospital resources. Wireless networks are one of the key enables of tomorrow’s hospitals. However, spectral usage, security, safety, and privacy issues of current radio-based wireless networks could undermine the attractiveness of these networks for future healthcare scenarios. The proposed solution, combining optical and radio transmission results in a network that can adapt itself in short- and long term to the changing communication requirements of hospitals. In principle, a hybrid network can tackle interference, exposure, privacy, and other key problems of conventional networks. The proposed system could intelligently reduce the exposure to radiation and generation of radio interference, while parallel optical-radio transmission could ensure secure, reliable and high capacity communications, using efficiently the available spectrum. In this chapter, the overall concept will be presented, and the possible operation scenarios and applications will be introduced too.

article,"Deglutition is the act of engulfing food or drink to pass down the throat into the digestive tract. It utilizes tongue and several smooth muscles of the pharynx and oesophagus. The initiation of swallowing is voluntary, but once the deglutition process starts, it becomes involuntary. Swallowing happens in four phases. An issue in any of the phases of swallowing leads to many swallowing disorders, dysphagia being one among them. Neurological degenerative conditions like Parkinson’s disease and stroke tend to affect the various phases of swallowing in the long run. Our study focuses on the pharyngeal phase. The most important aspect of the pharyngeal phase is the superior and anterior movement of the hyoid bone and larynx, to keep the air ducts out of the pathway of the bolus. Conditions leading to the impairment of the muscles and nerves related to the pharyngeal phase lead to aspirations and swallowing troubles. This work aims at the development of a simple and cost-effective means for real-time assessment of deglutition problems. It was observed that the movements of the hyoid bone can give signals that hint difficulty in swallowing. The waveforms obtained show distinctive features for various consistencies (solid, semi-solid, liquid) of bolus. The swallowing signals are found to be different between healthy and neurological disorder subjects. Hence, the prototype designed can be used as a candidate to pick up and analyse deglutition sounds, and on miniaturization, the prototype can be used for clinical correlation.",,2022-07-22 11:32:24 +1000,2022-07-22 11:33:03 +1000,10.1007/978-981-16-1696-9_43,,,,455--463,Dysphagia and Silent Aspiration Monitoring for Patients with Neurological Disorder Using Pharyngeal Deglutitive Biomechanics,,2021,http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-16-1696-9_43,"[{'first': 'Dhivya', 'last': 'Balaji'}, {'first': 'G.', 'last': 'Niranjana'}, {'first': 'Usha', 'last': 'Dalvi'}, {'first': 'Varshini', 'last': 'Karthik'}]",Soft Computing: Theories and Applications,,http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-16-1696-9_43,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-16-1696-9_43,,,,

The paper presents the use of a fractional derivative to construct a feature vector. Using the IriShield scanner, a database of iris photos obtained in the near infrared was generated. The iris area was segmented and normalized using the Daugman algorithm. Iris feature vectors were obtained by weaving a standardized iris image with a kernel of a gradient edge detector using derivatives of fractional orders according to the Riemann-Liouville definition. For the efficiency assessment of the proposed approach, the comparison of results obtained with a Log-Gabor filter, which is a classic method of quadrant coding in the Daugman algorithm were performed. A statistical analysis of the effectiveness of the proposed method was carried out using the Hamming distance measurement to compare the generated iris codes. The conducted experiments allowed to determine the optimal order of derivative and size of the fractional derivative kernel in order to increase the discrepancy of feature vectors data.

article,"India is a developing country and needs to occupy low-cost plus effective measures in controlling traffic. With the increase in Indian urbanization, more people are moving from rural areas to cities leading to excess population, which can be easily seen on roads. Due to increase in number of citizens in particular cities, automobiles can also be seen in enormous number. With the increment of vehicles, traffic system needs to be in order. Traffic system in most of the Indian cities is based on fixed time control mode or manual over-ride mode. But with the modernization with time, we need to implement a new and efficient traffic control system. In this research work, the authors have proposed an adaptive traffic light control system, which is helpful to avoid congestion of vehicles and time consumption. This adaptive traffic control system uses camera as an input sensor, which takes snapshots of roads from different angles and directions to provide input data as form of images.

article,"With the growing demand in the energy, it is very difficult for the conventional energy sources to cope up with that demand. Due to the eco-friendly nature, use of renewable resources to meet up with that demand is increasing day by day. Among those different renewable resources large amount of solar energy is harnessed in farms. Standalone panels are used in solar lights and other small applications. Rooftop PV’s are installed in commercial buildings. Use of solar panel is also cost beneficial for the end consumers.

article,"Attribute Based Encryption (ABE) has emerged as an access control technique for sharing data in cloud environment. In systems using ABE, the data owners specify the recipients for their data on the basis of attributes carried by them. The users obtain the attributes from appropriate authorities. In the context of open access systems, data pertaining to an organization is used within the organization by the internal members and at the same time, it can be shared with the users outside the organization. Sometimes, such shared data could be of critical importance. For example, medical data of a patient owned by a hospital could be important for a doctor to provide him suitable treatment. In this case, any authorized doctor should be able to treat the patient. Current ABE based schemes exhibit some limitations in addressing attribute management and policy formation issues for open access systems. In this paper, a Hierarchical Distributed Multi-Authority Attribute Based Encryption (HD-MAABE) scheme is proposed, where the organization and standard attribute authorities issue the attributes. Internal users of the organization get their attributes issued from the organization and attribute authorities arranged in a hierarchy are responsible for issuing valid attributes to the users external to the organization. Arrangement of attribute authorities in a hierarchy makes the system easily scalable, as attribute authorities can be added through a simple attribute delegation mechanism. This also makes it possible to issue attributes in a distributed manner.",,2022-07-22 11:32:24 +1000,2022-07-22 11:33:04 +1000,10.1007/978-981-15-0633-8_18,,,,183--193,HD-MAABE: Hierarchical Distributed Multi-Authority Attribute Based Encryption for Enabling Open Access to Shared Organizational Data,,2020,http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-15-0633-8_18,"[{'first': 'Reetu', 'last': 'Gupta'}, {'first': 'Priyesh', 'last': 'Kanungo'}, {'first': 'Nirmal', 'last': 'Dagdee'}]",International Conference on Intelligent Computing and Smart Communication 2019,,http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-15-0633-8_18,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-15-0633-8_18,,,,

article,"This paper represents an optimized approach to select the train route and schedule in order to avoid any unexpected incident while ensuring a better journey saving both cost and time. For that purpose, insightful analysis is required in order to deal with all the possible traffic overflow as well as train arrival and departure schedule. To understand the traffic and route selection-related problems precisely, some railway junction information especially the information of the proposed Dhaka Metro Rail junction is primarily considered. A deep analysis on the collected data is conducted, and the ordinary schedule and route selection approach is identified as the principal reason behind most of the unexpected incidents. So, this research focuses on optimizing the existing schedule and route selection system. For that purpose, several optimization techniques are studied, and finally, the genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed to optimize the train schedule and route selection problem. This paper provides a step-by-step illustration of the genetic algorithm in terms of optimizing the train route selection strategy. The proposed optimized system has been tested with a huge amount of data, and surprisingly, the system is found with 98.5% accuracy.",,2022-07-22 11:32:24 +1000,2022-07-22 11:32:58 +1000,10.1007/978-981-16-0586-4_40,,,,495--507,A Genetic Algorithm-Based Optimal Train Schedule and Route Selection Model,,2021,http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-16-0586-4_40,"[{'first': 'Md.', 'last': '{Zahid Hasan}'}, {'first': 'Shakhawat', 'last': 'Hossain'}, {'first': 'Md.', 'last': '{Mehadi Hassan}'}, {'first': 'Martina', 'last': 'Chakma'}, {'first': 'Mohammad', 'middle': 'Shorif', 'last': 'Uddin'}]",Proceedings of International Joint Conference on Advances in Computational Intelligence,,http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-16-0586-4_40,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-16-0586-4_40,,,,

article,"In order to obtain a new-type short cylindrical cup-shaped flexspline that can be applied to space mechanisms, the APDL language of ANSYS software was employed to develop a parameterized equivalent contact model between a flexspline and a wave generator. The validity of the parameterized equivalent contact model was verified by comparing the results of the analytic value of the contact model and the value calculated by the theoretical formula. The curvilinear trend of stress was obtained by changing the structural parameter of the flexspline. Based on the curvilinear trend of stress, multi-objective optimizations of key structural parameters were achieved. Flexspline, wave generator, and circular spline of a new 32-type short cylindrical cup-shaped harmonic reducer were designed and manufactured. A performance test bench to carry out tests on the harmonic reducer was designed. Contrast experiments were implemented to determine the efficiency of the new 32-type short cylindrical cup-shaped harmonic reducer and the conventional 32-type harmonic reducer under different conditions. The experimental results reveal that there is approximately equality in terms of efficiency between the new 32-type short cylindrical cup-shaped harmonic reducer and the conventional 32-type harmonic reducer. The volume of the flexspline of the new 32-type short cylindrical cup-shaped harmonic reducer is reduced by approximately 30% through multi-objective optimization. When the new 32-type short cylindrical cup-shaped harmonic reducer is used on the wheel of a rover prototype, the mass of the wheel hub is decreased by 0.42 kg. Test analysis of wheel motion verifies that the new 32-type short cylindrical cup-shaped harmonic reducer can meet the requirements regarding bearing capacity and efficiency.",,2022-07-22 11:32:24 +1000,2022-07-22 11:33:06 +1000,10.1007/s11771-012-1221-0,,2095-2899,,1869--1882,Optimization and experimental research on a new-type short cylindrical cup-shaped harmonic reducer,19,2012,http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11771-012-1221-0,"[{'first': 'Hai-bo', 'last': 'Gao'}, {'first': 'Hong-chao', 'last': 'Zhuang'}, {'first': 'Zhi-gang', 'last': 'Li'}, {'first': 'Zong-quan', 'last': 'Deng'}, {'first': 'Liang', 'last': 'Ding'}, {'first': 'Zhen', 'last': 'Liu'}]",Journal of Central South University,7,http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11771-012-1221-0,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11771-012-1221-0,,,,

article,"For single-frequency network (SFN) transmission, the echoes coming from different transmitters are superimposed at the reception, giving rise to a frequency selective channel. Although multicarrier modulations lower the dispersion, the demodulated signal is sensitive to be degraded by inter-symbol interference (ISI) and inter-carrier interference (ICI). In view of this, we use channel coding in conjunction either with filter bank multicarrier (FBMC) modulation or with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). To deal with the loss of orthogonality, we have devised an interference-aware receiver that carries out a soft detection under the assumption that the residual interference plus noise (IN) term is Gaussian-distributed. To keep the complexity low, we propose to estimate the variance of the IN term by resorting to data-aided algorithms. Experimental results show that regardless of the method, FBMC provides a slightly better performance in terms of coded bit error rate than OFDM, while the spectral efficiency is increased when FBMC is considered.",,2022-07-22 11:32:24 +1000,2022-07-22 11:33:05 +1000,10.1186/1687-6180-2013-163,,,,,Low-complexity interference variance estimation methods for coded multicarrier systems: application to SFN,2013,2013,http://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1687-6180-2013-163,"[{'first': 'Marius', 'last': 'Caus'}, {'first': 'Ana', 'middle': 'I', 'last': '{Perez Neira}'}, {'first': 'Markku', 'last': 'Renfors'}]",EURASIP Journal on Advances in Signal Processing,1,http://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1687-6180-2013-163,https://doi.org/10.1186/1687-6180-2013-163,,,,

article,"Hi, good afternoon everyone. We have come to the last talk. I know many of you are probably desperate for a pint in the pub, so I will make your life easy and keep the talk short. This talk is about “verifiable classroom voting”. If you look for the literature on this subject, you will probably find none. The reason should become clear later in the talk. This work is in collaboration with Dylan Clarke, and Carlton Shepherd. Dylan is an RA working with me and Carlton is a third year undergraduate student in the School of Computing Science, Newcastle University.Here is the outline for the talk. First, I will give you some background on classroom voting. I will explain what classroom voting systems are currently available. However, none of those available systems is “verifiable”. Next I will describe our solution. And in addition to describing the theoretical design, we will present a prototype implementation of the design. Furthermore we will present our trial experience of applying the prototype in a real classroom environment to enhance the students’ learning process. That has received good student feedback.

article,"A way of measuring a brain response during cognitive, sensory, or motor event is called event related potential (ERP). Electroencephalography (EEG) data during ERP can be used to cognitive operations. Recently, to classify ERP from EEG signal has begun to apply a compact convolutional neural network (EEGNet) but its performance depends on the data size.To discriminate between correct and incorrect ERP responses of a subject here a classification algorithm with smoothing of xDAWAN spatial filtering method is proposed. A spatial filtering xDAWAN method extracted only true ERP signal from EEG signal by increasing signal to noise ratio and discarding noise. We have reduced the dimension of the true ERP data by applying Riemannian geometry. Riemannian geometry calculated covariance matrix from true ERP data and all covariance data mapped into a euclidean space called tangent space and produced Riemannian feature vector. Finally, feed this Riemannian feature vector by a machine-learning algorithm to predict ERP response. As a machine-learning algorithm, we used here specially K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and Minimum Distance to Mean (MDM) as a classifier. To evaluate our model, here used EEG data, which contains data for left ear auditory, right ear auditory stimulation and left visualization, right visualization stimulation. xDAWAN is effective due to EEG is a narrow and noisy signal. Performance of Riemannian geometry also not depend on noisy or data size. Our model achieved better performance than other did specially EEGNet.

Advanced technology continuously increases abilities of components related to these types of systems while reducing their sizes and costs. In this study a real-time wireless temperature data monitoring system including four nodes to acquire temperature based data and one base station to monitor these collected data was developed. Communication between remote terminal units (RTU) and base station was implemented using Radio Frequency (RF) transceivers. Time-division multiple access (TDMA) method was established to provide sequential access to each RTU. Developed system could be adequate for continuous communication and also it was able to support additional RTUs. Laboratory tests were conducted to demonstrate developed system’s functionality.

article,"The first step of the robotic polishing process for aircraft large parts is related to the choice of tools and adjustment of process parameters. The parts have a finish state obtained by 5 axis machining with ball end tool. The objective of the polishing operation is to erase the tool marks, ensuring the imposed profile surface defect and surface state. This requires the choice of polishing tools and the setting of strategy parameters, particularly the polishing force. It must be controlled according to the contact surface between the tool and the part and the attempted polishing pressure. This polishing pressure is defined from a desired removal rate and surface quality.

article,"Nickel-based alloys are frequently applied in the
aerospace and power generation industries due to their excellent
material properties, such as high temperature strength and high
corrosion resistance. These advantageous material properties,
however, result in challenges for cutting operations. Contrary to
turning, where good results for the machining of nickel-based alloys
have been obtained, drilling processes are less investigated until
now. In general, coated cemented carbide drills have been proven to
show good performances in drilling operations based on their higher
strength compared to high speed steel (HSS) tools. Hence, they can
be utilized with more efficient process parameters, whereby tool life
will likely be reduced as a consequence of the higher loads. In order
to find reasonable trade-offs between efficiency and tool life, a
multi-objective optimization based on both criteria is presented in
this article. The optimization of the cutting parameters is performed
for drilling the popular nickel-based alloy Inconel 718. It is assisted
by empirical models based on statistical experimental design
techniques. By these means, the trade-off surface between process
efficiency and tool wear can be approximated within a small
experimental effort. In addition, the dominant mechanisms behind

Pseudorandom numbers find its application in the network security domain in key generation, re-keying, authentication, smart-phone security, etc. These random numbers are produced through PRNG (Pseudorandom Number Generator). Hence, if there is a flaw or the PRNG produces predictable sets of random numbers, then the entire application would be prone to attacks. Therefore, development of a generic framework for generating strong sets of pseudorandom numbers is proposed. Hardware implementation for GSM stream cipher has already been implemented, under a particular segment of mobile communication. The project advanced into many dimensions like vulnerability testing, protocol designing, implementation in both software and hardware and evaluating. The proposal aims to build an in-general framework and a unified model for enhanced security specifically for LFSR (Linear-feedback shift register)-based stream ciphers. Hence, a thorough study on already existing LFSR-based ciphers is done. This study aims to extract out the behaviour of different ciphers under different application domains. As pseudorandom numbers are used in both software (stream ciphers, protocol design) as well as hardware (wireless devices, smart phones) areas of security, the generic model proposed is aimed at using a co-simulation of both hardware and software. For software development of the cipher, a parallel computing environment has been chosen because in today’s computing trends, multi-core processors are superseding the sequential ones; hence, the basic force for growth of processor is to increase parallelism rather than increasing the clock rate.
